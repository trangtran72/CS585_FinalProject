In your body? Especially in your childs body?<br />Learn why you may want to fear your food.,"Food, Inc"
111470,B002LBKDYE, A24Y3JBTJD5R1K,5.0, For those who eat food!,"I don't know that my eating habits changed, but I defiantly became more informed about the food industry.<br /><br />A must-see video for this generation!","Food, Inc"
111471,B002LBKDYE, ABND7UR0H37JW,5.0," if you're a parent, don't miss this","Well worth the time, this engrossing and enlightening film opened up my eyes to the importance of my family's food choices on several levels.","Food, Inc"
111472,B002LBKDYE, A3EK4NS9CMXC7W,5.0," I'm not an activist, but I do want to live a long healthy life","When movies like this come out I am often hesitant to watch. I am not an activist and I do like to eat meat. I do believe that animals can be humanely slaughtered and brought to market which often times some cultures say is not possible. This movie was not preachy, but informative. By starting small, making minor changes we can eat healthier and help our children live healthier. It only takes the desire to feed our families well to impact the entire food culture. Definitely a must see movie.","Food, Inc"
111473,B002LBKDYE, A1LIDERT7U0NN8,5.0, Well Worth Your Time,"I am always hesitant to watch certain documentaries because many of them mimic productions by Al Gore and Michael Moore which are not documentaries at all, just a film makers' own viewpoint.Film makers like Gore and Moore believe their audiences aren't smart enough to figure out the issue, so they resort to pandering and preaching. They overlook contrasting viewpoints and only present what they believe to be the facts. Their documentaries work on an emotional instead of a rational level and should be treated as short, bizarre films only. Documentaries by nature should be informative, innovative, and as balanced as can be. This simple formula eliminates many of these baised and unbalanced films and simply aren't worht the time. They are only viewed by people who already support that viewpoint.<br /><br />So, it was with much trepidation that I followed the advice of a fellow professor and watched Food Inc. I thought it would be as poorly made as those I usually avoid. I couldn't have been more wrong. Food Inc. is a fascinating film that chronicles how food is grown, harvested, packaged, and sold in America. While it does have some graphic scenes of animal processing plants, it's goal is not to shock or disgust. It's to provide a context for the rest of the film. It is well balanced and well presented. The film maker allowed the facts to be presented so that reasonable discussion can follow. The film presents what's going wrong as well as what's going right.<br /><br />A documentary should make the viewer think. This film delivers.","Food, Inc"
111474,B002LBKDYE, A2WOL56UKTBOES,5.0, Surprisingly level documentary,"An important work--it really opened my eyes to the business of food. Not heavy handed, it brings facts and for the most part allows viewers to draw their own conclusions. Particularly interesting was the level to which big (food) business individuals wind up in government, making key policy decisions that affect us all. I left determined to be deliberate about the food choices I make for myself and my family.","Food, Inc"
111475,B002LBKDYE, A15UQM9K3TBIQV,5.0, pk,Had a good cry after watching this film.  Makes you wonder what the hell went wrong....  I have a 2 year old grandson that I worry so much about in regards to our ever changing diets.  I hope if you get the opportunity to watch this film that you will.  I for one will be filling my cart with more organic foods even if that means i have to shop at small co-ops.  I will buy from local farmers.  I really appreciate that Wal-Mart has made a change for what people are requesting....  I really appreciate everyone that worked on this film... Thanks for the change I know it will make in the lives of my family... :),"Food, Inc"
111476,B002LBKDYE, A1ZEIAKVV6PRAY,5.0, Great documentary.,"As I watched this movie, I was expecting another PETA style film. In actuality. The film shows you whats going on in our worlds food manufacturing companies and lets you make your own decision. I have since made life changes to eat free range and local meats and as much organic food and locally grown food as I can afford to.","Food, Inc"
111477,B002LBKDYE, A3LITH618MC175,5.0," eye-opening, engaging and well-made",This movie is certainly one of the best documentaries I have seen in years. Food Inc makes me wonder what the United States is REALLY doing about food and everything else; it is really a shame that more people have not watched this movie. America was founded by people who were well-informed about the day's issues. Can we now say the same?,"Food, Inc"
111478,B002LBKDYE, ACPEZ2AKRWSGY,5.0, Worth your time,"I moved from the UK to the US recently, I just couldn't get over how cheap fast food was here. Watch this to understand why. We're all a little bit aware this stuff, but it's still a shock to see it all at once. The film is superbly made, honest, straightforward - not a conspiracy theory. Very much worth your time.","Food, Inc"
111479,B002LBKDYE, AL6EAWG5RTM0A,5.0, Must See !!!,"You will not eat the same after this movie. This is not liberal hysterics. I'm usually cynical and opinionated about everything and never at a loss for words, but I was quiet during this movie. I kind of knew this was going on but still shocked to see it. Everyone should watch this show, I think we would all be better off if they did. I only give 4 stars or less to everything I have ever rated on amazon and that is because those items couldn't or didn't change my life very much. This is my first 5 star rating after many other ratings.","Food, Inc"
111480,B002LBKDYE, A2PDGLKFR955PE,5.0, Watch with a open mind.,"FOOD, Inc. is not gospel.  It's not 100% FACT.  It doesn't show the WHOLE picture of what is going on but it will give you a nice start into doing your own thinking.  It really takes you back and makes you wonder.<br /><br />Good or Bad.  My wife and I realize that eating fast food is not good.  But it is part of the world today.  We try to eat as much natural and organic as we can, yet we know it's not practical to eat 100%.  We try to buy organic milk, eggs and vegetables as much as we can but we will not pay double.<br /><br />Watch this movie.  Its TWO THUMBS UP.  Eat KFC if you are in a hurry or craving it. Just don't live off it.  :)  Be Smart.","Food, Inc"
111481,B002LBKDYE, ARIH1E57954V1,5.0," It is time to take a stand for your Rights, your Health and your Freedoms!","This documentary is very well done, extremely informative, and tremendously engaging. It provided a wide array of information, and personal stories as an example. I think it should be required watching for every person in an industrialized nation, especially America.<br /><br />Genetically engineering your food, refusing to accurately label your foods, creating mega monopolies, placing their officials in your gov't overseeing policies concerning them, strong arming farmers, suing farmers for using their own seeds, torturing animals, poisoning people, encouraging illegal imigration and getting away with it, and even depriving YOU of your right to free speech?!? Veterans day was yesterday, honor the veterans in your life by standing up against the food industry dictatorship that is stripping your country of its health, wealth, well being and FREEDOM!!! Every item you purchase is a vote, make sure YOU are voting for the right things!","Food, Inc"
111482,B002LBKDYE, A2NH5G7FVR5JA0,5.0, Eye Opener,"Great movie, it allows you to see where most of our food comes from and the process. Makes you think...that you actually have the power as a consumer to support companies and their methods. Similar movies like King Corn and End of The Line are good to watch if you like this movie.","Food, Inc"
111483,B002LBKDYE, A394FPN5HH3P3O,5.0, Real Food where is it?,This puts it all together and lets you know what is happening to your food.  We will never be able to claim our rights to real food if we do not know how it was stolen from us.  Buy this now.,"Food, Inc"
111484,B002LBKDYE, A3HS5U2UUSQP0N,4.0, Food Inc. is essential viewing,"""Your going to give youself a heart attack if you think about it. Just eat it"" Jared Edinger (childhood friend)<br /><br />  Well when I was seven years old that worked pretty well at getting me to shut my mouth at his fathers bad cooking and just eat it. Now that I'm an adult I would rather not eat poison, and I most certainly don't want to feed it to my children (as a side note my childhood friend feeds his children much better than his dad fed him as well). Food INC. is nothing short of eye opening, jaw dropping, in your face proof that the food industry is not to be trusted. Not only is our food supply tainted with bacterial killers while the industry refuses to truly fix the problem, but we are being sold poor health as well. Farmers are being told to raise chickens in a certain way which they know is not healthy for the chicken or for us. Cattle are being raised on corn based feed that promotes ecoli growth, and they are being kept in unsanitary conditions which also can impact our health. They industry has created soy beans that are immune to round-up (you know so they can spray that same round up on the crops to kill the weeds but not the soy beans). They are shaking down farmers to force them to buy their hybred crops or be eliminated from the market, and forced into bankruptcy. The amount of eye opening scenes come one after another.<br /><br />  This review can't do this film justice. However, if I were to come up with one thing I didn't like it is the scenes that pander the pro union message. I don't really care if you like unions or not. I just don't feel it added anything to the film.","Food, Inc"
111485,B002LBKDYE, A1S0XR6U5XA91M,5.0," FOOD, INC.","Makes you wonder what is in our food and what it has done to our bodies.  Could there be a link to the overwhelming numbers of unhealthy American chidren?  Autism, ADD and cancers?","Food, Inc"
111486,B002LBKDYE, ANCHEG4GMYC2E,5.0," Wonderfully edited, great information, and well put together.",This dvd was VERY insightful and informative. To understand where exactly our food is coming from and who has control (greedy politicians) was eye opening. Organic all the way!,"Food, Inc"
111487,B002LBKDYE, A37CENQP0ZNKVE,5.0, Very Well Done!,"Very educational and well put together documentary.  Really touches basics on how and why our food industry does what it does and how they become the winners; while us, wanting to eat 'real, organic, natural from nature' foods are the losers who have to continue to fight against a main-stream money making industry where profit is the highest gain, not our health.  Watched it on Net-Flix a few times.  I always buy organic and raw and support our smaller growers because of the added health benefits and hopes they will be able to compete more effectively with the top conglomerates who rule in food manufacturing.","Food, Inc"
111488,B002LBKDYE, A3RJ2SXOAYYC2Q,5.0," Food, Inc.","I saw this on PBS and also promoted on the Oprah show.  It is extremely well done.  Has a lot of information on following the food on your plate back to the farm.  It has alot of information.....I've watched it at least four times (learn more each time) and plan to show it to a Holistic Health class I'm teaching.  It is very informative and not for the faint of heart (you will see horrible conditions that animals are raised in vs. the organic small farm method).  Seeing animals butchered will bother some, but it is a reality of where food comes from.  It is especially upsetting to see how farming has changed over the decades to HUGE corporations and a government that does't seem to have a shred of concern for the animals or crops, farmers, workers, or the consumer.  The USA has some of the UNHEALTHIEST people in the world due to poor diet and lack of exercise.  This film does encourage us to change the food industry because our food CHOICES drive this industry.  Do we care enough to change it?","Food, Inc"
111489,B002LBKDYE, AQ19VUJ1BIAV4,5.0, Everyone should see this!,"This is a movie that everyone should see. I believe that people have the right to make informed decisions. As consumers, we are not given all the information we should have to make smart choices for ourselves and our environment. Viewing this movie is a step to being a smarter consumer.  Corporations will continue to feed us junk as long as we buy it. The problem is, we don't know what we are really buying. What we think is healthy may not really be what we think it is. As consumers we have the power to make changes in our society by how and where we spend our dollars. Invest in this and you are investing in your health and your future.","Food, Inc"
111490,B002LBKDYE, A3CTQNPZO7ZBLP,5.0, Best movie I've ever seen for educational purposes,"I am a PROCESSED-FOODS CONVERT, thanks to this amazing documentary, and subsequently others similar to it in nature.<br /><br />Before, I mindlessly went about my daily life, buying processed foods and easy take-out for too many years, being a busy working mom with two kids in two activities at a time. Hey, they wouldn't put anything to compromise our health in those boxes. Yeah....right....<br /><br />Since about April of this year, I've been researching & learning about natural foods, enzymes and how incredibly valuable they are for us all, and most shockingly, what's happening to our food supply right under our very noses as we go about our busy lives, assuming everything is just fine.<br /><br />There is so much MSG & HFCS (High fructose corn syrup) in the majority of processed foods, which so many of us are eating AND feeding our children, not to mention the genetic modification of the very seeds we need to sustain life, which this film documents and explains very, very well.<br /><br />Companies are patenting and modifying the very DNA of the plants we eat and feed our livestock & poultry. Let that sink in for a moment. One of those also makes a very potent & popular weed killer. Hmmmm....food supply owners AND poison factory? The same company? Hmmmmmm...<br /><br />If you educate yourself by buying growth-hormone free, antibiotic free, non-genetically modified 100% ORGANIC vegetable, dairy and meat products, you VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLARS & the producers will get the message. The first documentary I watched on the subject was Food, Inc., and is a real eye-opener. This led to the viewing and further investigation of others. The more I uncovered, the more upset I became, but then I empowered myself again, as I am in charge of what I put into my body!<br /><br />I also got the KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus 5-Quart Stand Mixer, in Black, at the same time, to make this new lifestyle choice less a chore & more doable. It's the best kitchen appliance I've ever owned, and makes cooking from scratch easy, peasy! Clean up is also a snap. This all came together for me because of this movie, and Michael Pollan's ""Food Rules"".<br /><br />The Fannie Farmer cookbook, recommended to me 15 years ago by my sister-in-law as a must-have, truly is a must-have! You will not be sorry, and even the pickiest of eaters will not be able to get enough.<br /><br />***IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WANTING TO LOSE WEIGHT:<br /><br />It has been my experience that eating REAL food without added fillers, preservatives & other chemical alteration FILLS YOU UP much faster than the processed stuff. MUCH! You'll have a lot of food left over when you cook and eat this way - the way we were meant to, so stock up on some freezer containers or a vacuum sealer. I got both.<br /><br />Doctors & alternative health practitioners stress that we should eat natural sugars, not artificial sweeteners. Eat actual, natural foods from this Earth, without all the added nonsense, and you'll naturally eat less. Plus, your body knows what to do with real sugar & how to process & eliminate it.","Food, Inc"
111491,B002LBKDYE, A10QHFZTRU83I9,5.0, I Decided Not To Be One of the Majority,"After seeing the movie, I decided to be a Vegan.  I never would have dreamed I'd become one, but actually, I am feeling better physically and have lost weight!!!!  Between watching the movie, reading ""Eat to Live"" and a book by Ruth Heidrich, who is vegan and a triathlete, I think I've made a healthy as well as ""green"" decision.  Plus, I don't want to support those companies which were focused on in the movie and treated animals with such disrespect.","Food, Inc"
111492,B002LBKDYE, A105YYPL7GBPJ0,5.0, AIN'T GONNA EAT YOUR MEAT NO MORE,"We watched this film one evening almost 2 years ago and have not eaten meat  - chicken, pork, and beef - since! It made me so ashamed to be one of the human beings sent here to watch over God's creatures and end up treating them so horribly, that I quit buying/eating meat immediately! I refuse to support this system which devalues animal life so blatantly - just for profit and spite! Nuts!","Food, Inc"
111493,B002LBKDYE, A1U4ENSV3G5EC6,5.0," Food, Inc",This is a great movie and a real eye opener. Makes me want to be vegan and support local organic farmers. I plan to share it with my family and friends.,"Food, Inc"
111494,B002LBKDYE, A7YA0AA9DIUH,4.0, Big Government and Big Farms Equal Big Problems,"Agribusiness is a popular word you may have heard. _Food, Inc._ will introduce you to some key players in the world of agricultural business, and points us all in the directions that are better for eaters, farmers, and America: back to growing/fattening the way God designed it. (Sidenote: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture is a joke. American crops and herds were better before it assumed its place among the eternal ever-expanding departments of the Federal Empire.)","Food, Inc"
111495,B002LBKDYE, A1T22RG6IGAPF9,5.0, DOLLAR VOTES,INFORMATIVE!!  this documentary helps immensely with the decisions regarding dollar votes and where we spend our money is perhaps more crucial than who we vote for.,"Food, Inc"
111496,B002LBKDYE, AHX41JP21F8JP,5.0, Changed My Life,"This is an amazing documentary that instantly made me rethink my ideas of food; where it comes from, who is in control of it, and how our current practices impact the environment.  The presentation of the material was balanced and made me aware of how much I assumed I knew about the food I eat. I feel this is a film everyone should see.","Food, Inc"
111497,B002LBKDYE, AUKD7VCMKMN4N,5.0," If you have any conscience, watching this movie will change your way of life...","I watched this over a month ago, and my way of life has changed completely.  I cannot purchase commercially produced meat, eggs, or milk -- now I know the high cost of misery and suffering (both human and animal) involved in it's production. I lent this movie to my friends and family, and they were also sobered by it's message.  This is a life changing film that everyone who eats needs to see.  Americans have closed their eyes for far too long to what goes into the food they eat.<br /><br />Watch this film, wake up, and take responsibility for the part you play in this horrifying drama.","Food, Inc"
111498,B002LBKDYE, ANOLMW1DI0EEL,5.0, An amazing eye-opener,"Food, Inc. really opened my eyes to all of the horrible things that I knew I didn't like about factory farming and our nation's food system as a whole, but I had never seen before. If you care about food, watch this.","Food, Inc"

111500,B002LBKDYE, A1UK85OFTSAZ6U,5.0, THIS COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE,"I first viewed documentary about 1 month ago on Amazon Instant prime members Video streaming and found to be life altering so much that I purchased several DVDs to give as gifts. We had already decided to change our eating habits prior to watching and this documentary sealed it for us.<br /><br />To see how the animals we eat everyday are treated by the agriculture industry was mind boggling. The question to eat grass-fed vs grain-fed beef, eating organic vs non-organic, free-range vs caged chicken, were all answered watching this DVD. Highly recommended.","Food, Inc"
111501,B002LBKDYE, A1PTTA9OBY3L31,5.0, You must see Food Inc.,"Food Inc. is a great documentary about agribusiness in America. The film traces the negative effects of the way these companies do business from your plate all the way back to the factory farms and petri dishes. Authors Michael Pollan and Eric Schlosser are among the people shedding light on the corporate controlled American food industry. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is important to see how your food gets to your table.","Food, Inc"

This movie will give you 1.5 hours of true and honest circumstances that these farmers and workers come accross that we as consumers really never think about. It's a must watch for those who care about perservation of the soul, our bodies, our families and environments and mother earth itself. Thank you for giving us this reality check. :)I will certainly think about what I ingest from now on.","Food, Inc"
111505,B002LBKDYE, A327S65LVV78X,5.0, Excellent Read,Enlightening and informative. This movie exposes so much with the commercial food system.  So much easier to make educated decisions for health and eating after watching this.,"Food, Inc"
111506,B002LBKDYE, ACRCG62EFE9T1,5.0, Informative movie,"This is a movie that is not afraid to tell the truth.

It reinforces  the reasons to be a vegetarian or at least to know about the food industry..","Food, Inc"
111507,B002LBKDYE, A2U92BOIZN8433,5.0, Fantastic and also quite disturbing,"Have you ever received a diagnosis of hypertension or high cholesterol? If this happens you begin to wonder about the food we eat. The film, ""Food, Inc."" makes you sit up straight in your chair and wonder what we have in our stomachs. Nutrition is very important to us as an alternative to pharmacotherapy. This film allows a person to question of how food is produced and that the FDA is still open for business. Suppose that the film is actually enough, you can ask questions about food production in the United States. Is anyone worried about security of the food we eat and why the fox guarding the henhouse in the national regulatory agencies and how long I am able to start growing food in the yard?<br />It is time for anyone concerned about the quality of what we eat vote by choosing quality over quantity in the supermarket, and an attempt to decent food affordable for families. We must wake up to the alarming methods.","Food, Inc"
111508,B002LBKDYE, A9S107KMH92LR,5.0," FOOD, Inc",So informative.

111512,B002LBKDYE, A1DMRPR4HBOKYE,5.0, Voting with food dollars...,"Wow. What a wake up call, sadly I knew most of the information included already but I have been too lazy to change MY behavior. This was just the wake up call I needed to be more aware of my food choices. My money is paying the bills of these large companies, I don't really want that.<br />This video isn't a vegetarian vs carnivore debate. This is honesty in food. This is a cry for INTEGRITY in American food production. Let's vote for organic, for truth in labeling and for (dare I say it again) Integrity in food production. We do this by CHOOSING to buy the foods that are produced ethically and non- genetically.<br />Thank You to the Food Inc producers and those who opened their homes, farms and lives to offer me this wake up call. I needed it and I thank you for your honesty.","Food, Inc"

111514,B002LBKDYE, ALAEPPDWV39Z1,5.0," Carnivores will turn vegetarian, I bet you...","Loce The Wizard's review back in 5/21/09 was profound, so thank you for that thorough review. Because of the reviews here, I purchased this fantastic documentary back on 9/5/10 for $22 & Amazon.com was gracious enough to also throw in there a free digital copy of the document for me to instantly stream while I was waiting for the Blu-Ray to arrive. As mentioned before by others, this documentary about the food industry is a raw-and-in-your-face fearless revelation about the inner-workings of the food industry & how the ""garbage-in-garbage-out"" adage is most true. This documentary not only gave me second thoughts about how the animals are treated but, even more so, how WE are poisoned (in the literal sense....just watch the part of the young boy that died)& condemned to avoidable & preventable illnesses due to how the food industry ""feeds the nation."" Others have successfully ranted about how horrendous this is, so I'll just say that this documentary effectively sheds light on all fronts of the food industry, products we purchase at the grocery store, down to fast food & chicken nuggets.<br /><br />You will turn a new leaf after watching this, & then eat that leaf in place of meat. If not, you're not from this earth.","Food, Inc"

111516,B002LBKDYE, A3AXXXWKQ33V35,5.0, You are what you eat,"This is an amazing documentary that will educate you about something very basic, something that you do at least once a day, eat. The authors tell and show your where the food that most of us eat every day is coming from. Be egoistic an watch this documentary because there is nothing as intimate as eating.","Food, Inc"
111517,B002LBKDYE, A1GMRHHFSYZU9J,5.0, Very Informative,"I really enjoyed this film. It is packed with information on how we get our food.

After our fridge and freezer emptys out we are buying from the farmers market only.  Our future plans involve adding a greenhouse, composter, chickens, and goats to our property.

It brought many tears to my eyes, watching how bad the humans and animals are treated in the production of the Big Mac, Whopper, and Original/Xtra Crispy Chicken.<br /><br />Basically, animals are treated like liveless widgets - stuffed with chemicals - scared to death - slaughtered inhumanely and then we are served this on a place after we hear the words, ""Can I take your order?""<br /><br />Really opened my eyes quite a bit and felt quite sorry for the lone farmer who just wanted to sell non-GMO soybeans and had his whole life turned upside down by evil Monsanto. I wonder how anyone has any morals or a shred of dignity working for that company. Shame on you Monsanto!<br /><br />I'm sure as people demand healthier food, Monsanto will jump on the bandwagon, hire this guy they financially brutalized and have him show them how to make seeds that are not Genetically modified.<br /><br />If consumers can get milk producers to stop putting synthetic hormones in milk (Walmart will not allow it any more), I'm sure we can turn around the cow, pig, and chicken mega-factories.","Food, Inc"

111531,B002LBKDYE, ADS5APY1NKTL4,4.0, engaging and educational.....,"What did I know before genetic modification and its effect on the public before I initially viewed this film?  What's more, what did I know about the factors involved with mass production of our nation's (and world's) food supply?  In all honesty, not too much. Though, I did a brief research paper/documentary film, while a student of biology in high school (in the mid 1990s) on the moral and scientific implications of genetically modified produce that was being engineered and churned out into supermarkets on a nation-wide (as well as global) scale. The idea of tomatoes ""immunized"" with protein derived from fish enzymes, to make them bigger, redder and quicker to ripen on the vine was almost a joke - but, a very bad one indeed. When you watch FOOD, INC. it sobers us all to the reality (and danger) of mass production on the consumer's side, as well as those directly engaged in production and distribution (farmers, companies and stores that carry food laden with GMO's and hormones, etc).<br /><br />We are presented with stark contrasts, in this piece of documentary insight. On one hand, we see the source of our nation's meat - chickens, pigs, cows - in almost unlivable situations, while cooped up in rooms that are barely breathable, where sanitation is non existent and the ethical/business practices of the parties responsible are nothing short of appalling. Visceral imagery is presented of hormone and water plumped chickens, who are all entrapped in one dark, cold, dirty silo, barely able to move a quarter of an inch. They are then heartlessly prepared for the market (execution style) with no consciousness of the effect of breeding and killing practices and how they might ultimately effect the health of the consumer eating them, fried and dressed, on the dinner table, just a month or two down the line.<br />We see appalling depictions of the reality of pig farming (details so disgusting I will not divulge here), as well as the effect of super powers (like Monsanto) on farmers in the Midwestern United States, as well as on a global scale. By now, many people are well aware of the evil and tremendous amount of power that this company wields in our world - agriculturally speaking. I think it is safe to say that 75 % of our nation's food (as well as food that is mass produced internationally) comes from production companies that buy seed (or are made to buy seed) from this company. Unless, of course, the consumer or market/grocery store has access to locally grown, non - GMO based produce (that doesn't merely mean ""organic"" sometimes).<br /><br />The film also examines how people have gone organic over the decades, how it got started with companies like Morningstar Farms (distributors of soy based products - like veggie bacon and buffalo wings) and Stonyfield Farms (distributors of yogurts). Though, it is intriguing and even inspiring to see how the two (aforementioned) companies got their start in their industries, it is also a cautionary reflection of the ""go Organic"" approach to mass production. Morningstar Farms is owned by Kellogg Company (cereals, etc) and Stonyfield Farms sells their products to Walmart. As I learned of this, I couldn't help but feel cynical.  Also, where do you suppose Kellogg gets their supply of grain for, say, corn flakes?  I will let you come to the answer of your own accord.<br /><br />Watch this film - it will shed some light on a very important topic - our food, how it is being produced in this ""Fast Food Nation"" and why (to paraphrase the old adage) we truly are what we eat.","Food, Inc"

111538,B002LBKDYE, A2Z1VRET1SFMJK,5.0, What Are You Eating?,"Food, Inc. will change the way you think about food and where it comes from. This documentary on the food industry delves into the business behind food production and the dark side of farming.<br /><br />A few multi-national companies control the vast amount of food production and dictate how farmers and growers run their operations. Though the documentary interviews individual farmers and workers, the huge corporations all seemed to decline to be interviewed.<br /><br />The documentary shows chicken growing productions where enormous chicken houses without access to light are a primary method for producing chickens. The conditions inside the chicken houses are disgusting and chickens are packed together with little room to move. They are fed hormones and antibiotics which reduce the chick to adult gestation period from 70 to 49 days. This growth is so rapid that the internal organs and body structure are not equipped to support the chicken.<br /><br />The documentary also shows enormous feed lot cattle productions where cattle are fed corn though the natural food is grass for cows. The cows stand in large amounts of their own manure which makes it much easier to spread Ecoli to the cows and sometimes ends up in the final product.<br /><br />Workers at a pork processing plant in North Carolina are interviewed to discuss the poor working conditions and what seems to be uncaring nature of the company towards it's workers. The conditions for the animals when they are growing are poor as well. They are  confined to a small cage rather than free to roam. It seems to be a mass production factory rather than an operation with good quality control and safety measures.<br /><br />Large fast food operations such as McDonalds want virtually identical products every time and this has resulted in cookie cutter production of food instead of the production of cows, chickens, and pigs. Their high demand for identical factory animals has pushed the concepts of mass production feed lots and encourages unsanitary conditions through cost cutting.<br /><br />There are now patent laws protecting specific strains of seeds which some companies have used to wield virtual monopoly power over farmers. One example mentioned in the documentary is the company Monsanto who controls 90% of all soybean production and forbids farmers from saving seed forcing them to continue purchasing seed from the company. The company resorts to strong arm tactics and regularly sues farmers and seed cleaners to further secure their monopoly under the auspices of protecting their soybean patent.<br /><br />The government officials responsible for regulating the food industry often have direct ties back to the major companies so there would appear to be a strong conflict of interest in enforcing regulations.<br /><br />A law called Kevin's law, named after a 2 year old who died following eating hamburger infected with Ecoli, has not become law yet but has had various versions proposed over the past 5 years. If passed this would give the USDA the ability to more closely regulate the meat and poultry industry to reduce pathogens in meat production and potentially shut down plants that breach health regulations. Feel free to contact your congress members to let them know of this proposed law.<br /><br />As an alternative to mass production, examples of organic farming are presented. The animals are able to interact with each other and walk around freely similar to how they might in the wild. They eat natural foods rather than being force fed corn. A very articulate and humorous farmer name Joel Salatin, owner of Polyface Farms in Virginia, has fully embraced this style of farming and runs a very successful operation. He talks about letting chickens be chickens and allowing the pigness of pigs. Though organic food costs a bit more, proponents say it taste better and is better for the eaters health. Large corporations such as Walmart and Target have begun selling organic food and this will help with economies of scale and cost reduction.<br /><br />Throughout the documentary I found myself going ""woah, your kidding right?"" I won't say that I'll never eat fast food again or purchase non-organic but it definitely gives pause towards thinking about where the things you're eating come from. I definitely recommend this 90 minute video to everyone wanting a behind the scenes look at the food industry.","Food, Inc"

While most of us might not realize exactly what goes into our food, or at times not even think about it. But director Robert Kenner and his production team seek to bring out the truth about what goes on behind the scenes of the food industry and make it transparent so we all know the truth about what goes into our food so we can make more decisions about what we put into our body.<br /><br />There's a lot of mystery in what goes on with our food. Whether it's ingredients we have no idea what they are, or whether it's the general process through which our food goes through, there's a lot that we don't know. The food industry hasn't really helped us in finding out either. Shrouding the farms that work for major industry markets in secrecy, and restaurant chains fighting tooth in nail to avoid giving us nutritional values for the meals we eat it seems as though the food industry as something to hide.<br /><br />As depicted in Food, Inc. the food industry does have a lot to hide. Not only do the ingredients that go into our food seem less than savory, but their deplorable treatment of stock animals, farmers, and workers are enough to make anyone sick to their stomach. The filmmakers don't just attack their query though, they try to present both sides of the story from the consumer to the market leaders, unfortunately in the case of the market leaders they more often than not decline to be interviewed. And while this documentary might not answer all of our questions about the food industry, it definitely does a great job at helping us realize that things must change.<br /><br />In the end Food Inc. doesn't just tell us about our food, but how the industry has changed things in America altogether. From appointed government officials who formerly worked for big name corporations and have influenced legislation on their behalf, to the food industry's influence on illegal immigration this film approaches all aspects of the trade.

111565,B002LBKDYE, A2K6DV0JQMLMVW,4.0, Cowhauler says...,"I haven't even seen this movie but I can attest to the fact that slaughterhouses are grim places and the beef industry a sad one, indeed.  After hauling cattle and hogs in a tractor-trailer to these charnel houses I have seen with my own eyes the impersonal, utterly depressing truth of factory farming.  The sweet momma cows who have given up their babies year after year until they can no longer produce 26 gallons of milk per day are then consigned to the hamburger trade.  They load up well since they are used to being handled and their udders, grossly distended from having not been milked in anticipation of slaughter, sway awkwardly.  As a former nursing mom I felt so sorry for this condition which I know from personal experience to be painful!<br /><br />Sometimes they would go down in transit and the kill plant would chain the cow's legs and drag her off the truck then lift her in the bucket of a front-end loader.  I remember one's udder leaking milk onto the dung-encrusted floor of the trailer ( We clean them but they fill up fast! ) in below-zero temps, leaving a frozen reminder of her service to mankind on the eve of her death.  It seemed obscene to trample the remnant of life-giving milk in the process of unloading the rest of them.<br /><br />While waiting to unload once I observed the cows go into the building, then somewhere within the next 30 feet behind the closed doors they met their deaths.  Then the bloody hides, so recently clothing a living creature, rose up a conveyor belt and fell in a heap into a dump truck to be taken to a tannery.  Every 40 seconds or so a fresh hide emerged from the building, steaming in the chilly air.  Talk about gluttony!  And all I could think about was the fat, oblivious masses of people gorging on fast food with no thought where it came from.<br /><br />I no longer eat hamburgers, hotdogs, bologna, or any other kind of processed meat that is ground up and reformed  ( I WILL NOT let my son eat chicken nuggets! ) because the sanitation practices necessary to a wholesome product seem unattainable to me with a workforce whose native language is not English.  The illegal immigrant situation is yet another aspect of this scenario; illegals can be forced to work in hideous conditions for fear of being turned in.  The little Latinas who worked in chicken plants when I hauled a reefer ( That's a refrigerated unit to you stoners out there! ) couldn't believe that a WOMAN was driving a truck all by herself.  When it dawned on them, they invariably burst out in broad smiles.  I hope they saw a way out of an abusive relationship or something by seeing me do that; apparently some illegal men have been known to terrorize their women the way employers terrorize them.<br /><br />At any rate, the food industry needs to be rethought from top to bottom.  Thomas Jefferson himself envisioned a nation of small-holders,each with his ( or her! ) own farm, each capable of self-sufficiency.  I'll be buying this movie ASAP!","Food, Inc"

I've watched this movie last night and I am still in shock.<br />I didn't order the dvd, I watched it online so I won't review the item or shipping, but the movie itself is very informative and scary at the same time.<br /><br />One reviewer complained about the fact there was no scientific experts. Well, knowing that the FDA had among its members ex-employees from Monsanto or other Companies (who returned working for them), I wouldn't fully trust the experts, unless they are independent, which won't really happen. How independent or free are we? We cannot even know if we're eating meat from cloned animals because the Big Companies don't want to ""scare"" people? We cannot have all the information to make our decision. We cannot even say ""I won't eat this or that"" because the Food Companies can sue anybody because it hurts their business? And what about our health ??<br /><br />How is soda cheaper than water? How is a burger cheaper than ONE red bell pepper? (hamburger 1$, 1 red bell pepper $1.89 in Houston, and it's not even organic!?).<br />Where do these E.Coli outbreaks come from? How come cows don't even eat grass anymore? How come the FDA is powerless and cannot event close down a ""factory"" which had E.coli contamination? Why? why? why?<br /><br />Almost 2 years ago, we watched ""the world according to Monsanto"" and I was disgusted by their way of doing business, hurting financially the farmers, changing our food, the official regulations etc... and so we made some personal changes.<br /><br />After watching ""Food Inc"", I won't turn vegetarian or ""hippie"" but for sure, I'll pay even more attention to what we eat and how the food is produced.

111569,B002LBKDYE, A1S7BFT0HDF3HA,5.0, Essential viewing---you need to look under the veil,"""Food, Inc."" does more than serve as an expos&eacute; on the United States food industry--it connects the dots between the nefarious, contemptuous business practices of multinational corporations and their best friends, the compromised government regulatory agencies such as the USDA, FDA, and EPA, who have in the past been led by folks well connected within the very industries they are supposed to regulate.<br /><br />But let's hold on a minute.  Filmmaker Robert Kenner's documentary could have been just a dour, paranoid investigative piece and still told the truth. Instead, Mr. Kenner has made a colorful, fast-paced, and well-documented account of the state of the food supply in our country; the unintended consequences of the efficiencies, short-cuts, and technological methods inherent in factory farming; the insidious insider relationship between the meat industry and the agencies that should be regulating it; and the health effects, including diabetes, of consuming processed foods and fast foods.<br /><br />Naturally, the culprits behind the curtain (e.g., Smithfield, Monsanto, Perdue) would not appear on camera, not because they are cowards but precisely because they are so powerfully connected, and have legions of lawyers and enforcers (yes, like any bully, these outfits do use intimidation), and are moving to control free speech and criticism of their practices.<br /><br />The counterbalance to the doom and gloom comes from interview with small farmers; with entrepreneurs in the organic food business; with the brave folks who have tried to make a stand against the food industry; and with those experts who are striving to be modern day Paul Reveres in the face of mass indifference.<br /><br />Kenner uses photography and imagery to make his points, and he interlaces this film with scenes of amazing beauty and graphic cruelty. ""Food, Inc."" is not an easy film to watch, and it should not be. Kenner uses the final frames to deliver some to-do's for those who want to respond to the film not just in conversation but through action. As trite as it sounds, if you can only see one movie this year, go to this one. (When the negative review start cropping up for this movie, it would be interesting to see how many of those are from food industry insiders and their minions.)","Food, Inc"

Apparently, many because we still haven't done anything.<br /><br />""Food, Inc."", directed by Robert Kenner, and co-produced by Eric Schlosser (writer of ""Fast Food Nation"") and Michael Pollan (writer of ""The Omnivore's Dilemma), takes an in depth view at a handful of various problems with the food industry in our country. Presented in ""Chapters"", Schlosser or Pollan introduce the various segments leading into a series of graphics, interviews, archival and hidden camera footage and more all of which illustrates the problems we are facing.<br /><br />Did you know that Chickens have been engineered to grow faster and larger, in order to produce more breast meat? The companies who provide us with chicken realized a while back that we prefer white meat. When a customer prefers something, it is more efficient to grow what the customer wants. White meat is also more expensive, so it is a win-win situation for these companies to fulfill our needs and wants. But what about the dark meat? The result? Engineered chickens ready for slaughter faster and yielding more white meat. But it also results in chickens with no flavor that are grown in very inhumane conditions. Most never see sunlight and can't walk for very long because their internal organs can't keep up with the growth of their bodies.<br /><br />For many years, corn farmers have lobbied lawmakers for protection and subsidies, and this has created an overwhelming abundance of corn. Because there is so much of the grain, scientists have worked out many ways to use the abundant staple, to prevent wasting it, and to maximize profits. One of these, high fructose corn syrup, is now in a majority of the items we consume. But they also decided to start feeding the corn to cattle animals that are supposed to eat grass. There is a by-product of this new practice; e-coli bacteria. When the cattle eat this feed, they have a higher chance of creating the bacteria. And the fact they are contained in small lots, with barely enough room to move around, standing knee deep in their own feces for hours every day, doesn't help the situation.<br /><br />Why do we raise the majority of the cattle in this country in such a fashion? Because the fast food industry (McDonalds purchases the most ground beef in the world) wants cheap beef. If they can feed the cattle more cheaply, those savings are passed on to the large chains and are then passed on to the consumer through ""Dollar"" and ""Value"" menus.<br /><br />These are just two of the stories the film follows in detail. Providing a lot of information, the filmmakers connect the dots to illustrate why our food production system is in need of some drastic changes.<br /><br />If we don't change it, we are going to continue to get sick, some of us will continue to die. And it is all preventable.<br /><br />Why do we allow it to continue? A handful of very large companies control all of the production of our processed foods. They lobby Congress and the Senate, getting the lawmakers to protect them. They don't have to do anything about it. When there is an outbreak, they make some minor changes, but as we saw from the E-Coli outbreak in hamburger, it happened a few times and will no doubt happen again.<br /><br />People are getting the message. Organic foods, farmer's markets and grocery chains like Whole Foods are becoming more and more prevalent popping up to meet the needs of a growing, more selective clientele.<br /><br />Are you getting the message?<br /><br />Or do you still want that hamburger that only costs $1?","Food, Inc"
111571,B002LBKDYE, A12A08OL0TZY0W,5.0, A food monoculture,"Robert Kenner's movie is a perfect illustration of F. William Engdahl's book `Seeds of Destruction', which explains how international agribusinesses are trying to monopolize vertically and horizontally (and profit from) food production on a world scale.<br /><br />The world's food chain is built mainly on heavily subsidized and, therefore, cheap corn. In fact, all humans chew corn the whole day long from bread over meat (all animals are fed with corn) to deserts and drinks. Transnational corporations are even trying to learn fish to eat corn. Corn becomes nearly a food monoculture.<br />A particular transnational company even developed through genetic engineering highly efficient corn seed which it patented, thereby creating a nearly seed monopoly. Buyers cannot use the produce of the seeds as plant seed for future harvests. The company's own inspection force controls with hawk eyes that its clients buy new genetically modified seed every year. Some of the company's supporters and former directors occupy key positions in US governments and government administrations (FDA).<br /><br />The movie shows the disastrous effects of intensive farming on animals, as well as the health and environmental risks of diminished standards at livestock farming and slaughtering houses.<br />Fortunately, some biological farmers show more respect for their animals and for their clients.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, the makers give a perfect list of recommendations for those wishing to eat `healthy' food.<br /><br />This movie is a must see for all those who want to understand the world we live in.","Food, Inc"

111573,B002LBKDYE, A1D2FXEWRIV1YV,5.0, An important movie that everyone should see,"I saw Food, Inc. several days ago and many of the images still haunt me.  The essence of this movie is how food production in America has gone from being locally produced to being controlled by multi-national corporations.  The upside of this is that food is cheaper and more plentiful.  This movie examines the downside, which is horrifying.<br /><br />All livestock (including fish) are now fed some sort of corn meal, regardless of whether this is what the would eat under ordinary circumstances.  For example, cows eat grass.  If they eat something else, it causes extra bacteria, including e-coli to grow in its stomach.  To treat this they are given antibiotics.  Milking cows are fed hormones to speed up milk production.  Chickens are fed so much corn to fat them up many cannot walk and they break their legs trying.  Or the legs get infected and they are given antibiotics.  One chicken farmer showed a ""typical"" day in the coop where she would go in and scoop up a dozen dead birds and through them on a gargabe heap. Lest it sound one sided, the large corporations were invited to participate in the movie and declined.<br /><br />While parts of this movie are difficult to watch, ultimately it ends on a high note that we, as the consumer, have the power to change food production processes.  As one farmer pointed out, you wouldn't buy the cheapest car or the cheapest clothes, so why apply the same philosophy to the purchase and consumption of food.<br /><br />Simply put, this movie will change your life.","Food, Inc"

But, I didn't realize the influence that fast-food  and chemical companies had on U.S. agricultural practices. I am now buying more local and organic produce, due to this film. Robert Kenner's film is not anti-carnivore, but it does make a good case for seeking out the beef from grass-fed cattle, and eating wild salmon and free-range chicken.<br /><br />The chicken coops in modern America are usually dark, crowded, and unhealthy places, with animals that can barely walk, since they have been bred to have breasts double the normal size. Seeds are genetically modified and patented, and then giant corporations prevent growers from using their own harvested seed. Corn is subsidized by the government and is then used to fatten cattle, but also fattens people--and also winds up in batteries and gasoline. E. coli is now a huge problem, due to current practices. There are fewer meat inspectors today than there were fifty years ago. Many appointees to the FDA are from the industries that should be regulated. Politicians of both political parties appoint them.<br /><br />Go see Kenner's film. It may change your life.","Food, Inc"
111575,B002LBKDYE, A1JAZC2O6IDQIG,4.0," Good documentary, interesting points","Food, Inc is an activist documentary, which aims to educate consumers about the food system. This is much of the same information found in the author's books: Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation) and Michael Pollan (Omnivore's Dilemma). But it puts together many interesting points, especially from economist's point of view.<br /><br />For one, most people don't think about how food is produced. We clearly see the benefits of mass production, such as lower prices and standardization, but not so much the downsides, such as poor conditions (for animals and workers), low diversity (system lacks resilience to external events, food is nutritionally limited) and health impact (unhealthy foods, obesity/diabetes, drug resistance, bacterial outbreaks).<br /><br />The second angle is the role of government. The documentary provides key insights, but doesn't seem to follow them through. On one hand, it states that ""we put faith in our government to protect us"", but on the other it admits that it failed us in many ways (regulatory agencies are controlled/lobbied by the industries it means to regulate, revolving door between industry and agencies, the FDA often cannot close unsanitary factories, FDA hampers small local growers).<br />There are three government interventions which caught my attention. They are clearly called out, but somehow are not discussed in the context of reforms.<br /><br />  1. subsidies to corn industry (pays to overproduce, distorts prices of meat, skews towards unhealthy food, makes it hard to compete locally and internationally)<br />  2. patent laws (give Monsanto leverage against farmers saving seeds)<br />  3. libel laws for food industry (mutes much of the criticism against them)<br /><br />Finally, the documentary emphasizes consumer sovereignty. Aside from the artifacts of government intervention, the system is very sensitive to consumer demand. It shows the example of Wal-Mart which is shifting to some organic produces to satisfy customers, and marketing products without growth hormones.<br />The conclusion highlights consumer choice as a driver for the system, which I think makes sense. It also recommends asking Congress for additional regulation, which I think is a mistake (giving Congress more reach will give the industries more incentives to control the political process, leading to more negative effects as seen above).<br />But overall, this is a worthwhile documentary, especially if you have not read the recent popular books on the topic.<br /><br />Posted my review at [...]","Food, Inc"
111576,B002LBKDYE, AQ990HW13DP08,5.0, Food Rage,"Robert Kenner's documentary food film demonstrates once again the public's hunger for a food ethic. As in previous films like Supersize Me and King Corn, the recipe for success is tried and, unfortunately, all too true. A few multi-national conglomerates, with the complicity of our federal regulatory agencies like the FDA and USDA, control a disproportionate amount of our food supply from farm to fork, to the detriment of public health, local farmers, international economies, exploited workers, the environment, and respect for animals. The sole corporate concern is a fat profit. If you are a farmer, you ought to think twice about challenging Monsanto. If you have children, consider that because of their ""normal"" diet, they have a 1 in 3 change of developing diabetes (1 in 2 if you are a minority). Much of this film is narrated by the understated Michael Pollan (The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food) and Eric Schlosser (Fast Food Nation). Although the film includes some very brave and creative alternatives, it's been a long time since I left a movie theater feeling so angry and (the real tragedy) so helpless to do much about the problem. Manohla Dargis of the NYTs described Food, Inc. as ""one of the scariest films of the year.""","Food, Inc"
111577,B002LBKDYE, AGVWTYW0ULXHT,4.0," If you are what you eat, then most of us have no idea who or what we are","Among the maxims carved on the entrances to the Greek temple of Apollo at Delphi, perhaps the most familiar and important were ""know thyself"" and ""nothing in excess.""  We have reached a point, two and a half millenia later, where we could really use both pieces of advice.  This film offers valuable wisdom to a culture in which the self is defined by the products we buy in far too much excess.<br /><br />If we are what we eat, then most of us (this author included) have hardly any idea who or what we are.  We live in a culture of abstraction: we don't see what goes into the products we buy, and are unaware of the true costs of the food that sustains our lives.  Director Robert Kenner has created a film that puts various pieces of the puzzle together, and helps make clear what it is we're buying, and what it is we're buying into, when we demand cheap eats, and reveals the truth behind the illusion that most of our food comes from quaint farms.<br /><br />As the film shows, by means of interviews, animations, effective video and surveillance tapes, there are hardly any family farms anymore, and most of our meat comes from massive factory farms in which animals are packed in tightly, wading through their own manure, rife with disease that is only partly kept in check by pumping chickens or pigs or cattle full of antibiotics.  That meat, of course, ends up in our food supply and in the fast food hamburgers, and there's hardly any effective oversight for consumer safety because, as it turns out, most of the regulators for the past couple of decades have been drawn directly from prominent positions in the industries they are supposed to regulate.  Then, there's the matter that all of these animals are mostly fed on corn, and most everything else we eat is made from corn or soy or corn and soy byproducts (such as high fructose corn syrup), primarily because corn is heavily subsidized in the United States, so that it can be sold below the cost of production.  The majority of the soy, it turns out, is bioengineered and patented by the same chemical company that produced those innovations we know as DDT and Agent Orange - and that same company (Monsanto) has made it virtually impossible for farmers to grow anything else but the seed that they must buy from Monsanto.  Not only that, but Monsanto's patents have made it illegal even for farmers to save their own seed from season to season, and Monsanto enforces its hegemony by means of intimidating lawsuits that most farmers just can't afford to fight.  It's a depressing story, made somewhat lighter by the inclusion in the film of a few somewhat successful crusaders fighting to bring healthy and sustainable farming and growing practices to the mainstream and to fight against the powers that profit a great deal from cheap and unhealthy foods.<br /><br />The film offers only a bit in the way of positive suggestions for real change, and that may be its main weakness.  Of course, the advice it does offer is probably the only advice you can offer: first, vote for good foods with your wallet by buying organic and local, and by encouraging distributors like Walmart to expand their healthy offerings; and secondly, organize and wield political power to support candidates who encourage green practices and to encourage elected officials to favor better regulation.  I think it would have been more effective to highlight these messages clearly one at a time throughout the film, at strategic points, rather than mostly in a few written suggestions at the very end of the film and just before the credits.<br /><br />Still, this is an important film that conveys a number of important and harrowing truths about the food industry more clearly and effectively than I've seen it elsewhere.  Of course there is Eric Schosser's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060838582"">Fast Food Nation</a>, and Michael Pollan's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038583"">The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</a>, but both of them are featured here and this is a quick and effective way to convey the most important messages, that could be explored further.

111578,B002LBKDYE, A2TIJREKDLV2S1,3.0," The Challenges of Cheap Food, Reiterated","The tenets of mass production have been praised and vilified for their effects on costs.  One camp lauds mass production for its ability to reduce costs and to place goods within the reach of the ordinary consumer.  Another camp criticizes mass production for its ability to hide costs rather than actually reduce them.  Of these two camps, Food, Inc. clearly falls in the latter one.  From a mutated chicken, to unsavory labor practices, to government policies run amok, Food, Inc. has one mission:  to lift the curtain on what is behind our hidden policy of cheap food.<br /><br />Leaning on commentary from Eric Schlosser (author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060838582"">Fast Food Nation</a>) and Michael Pollan (author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038583"">The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</a>), Food, Inc. largely reiterates what these authors have already put into print.  At least for this reviewer, who read Pollan's book with gusto, there was nothing new here, and this was disappointing.  True, Food, Inc. challenges our labor and agricultural practices with sometimes brutal images, but all in all, it limits itself to retracing Pollan's steps.  In doing so, Food, Inc. merely provides a visual introduction to the characters and scenes Pollan already has described in vivid detail.<br /><br />In some ways, this approach adds a visual layer of depth to Pollan's account of mass produced food in 21st Century America.  In the end, though, the message is still the same:  our policy of cheap food has consequences for society and the individual.  For those who are unaware of what these consequences are, Food, Inc. provides a thorough introduction and challenges you to do something about it.  For those who are familiar with Pollan's book, Food, Inc. is largely reiterative, but appreciably so.","Food, Inc"

I've read things in books, but when you see it on the camera it makes it so much more real.<br /><br />This movie touches on many problems in our food industry.  For example, genetically modified foods, how we may end up eating cloned animal meat if we don't speak up to congress and the FDA, how there are only a few companies controlling most of the food industry and how that power and money are influencing our government and railroading farmers, and of course, how inhumane these animals, and the workers who process them, are treated.<br /><br />The most eye-opening things for me were: 1)if you feed cows grass for 5 days, they'll clean themselves of 80% of ecoli bacteria, but instead of doing that, industries ""cleanse"" our meat with AMMONIA, 2)policy makers and judges are not in bed with these corporations, they come straight from these companies to these very important political positions, 3)the USDA no longer has the power to shut down factories who repeatedly have tainted facilities, 4) corporations can now patent life and therefore can sue others for using/reusing their ""seeds,"" and will take farmers who don't use their seeds to court accusing them of this crime just to send a message, and/or to put this farmer out of business and in process these lawyer/companies are able to obtain EVERY BANK TRANSACTION that farmer has made in the past 10 years (I imagine the companies then go after the people with whom the poor farmer/seed cleaner has been in business).<br /><br />What I found disappointing was the lack of information in this video, but it is a movie, not a mini-series.  As I said, ""it touches"" on these different issues, but there's much more to know - I guess the watcher should be smart enough to do more research and read some books.  I would've like have seen in this video, ""why is corn so harmful to digest by animals AND humans? how can the stress these animals are in, especially before the slaughter, affect us? what happens to these small organic companies who get bought out by corporations but keep their ""organic"" identity? how exactly does a food become ""genetically modified"" and what may be the consequences to our health? how close are we (or are we already there) to having our food come from cloned animals? what other ways is the farmer, who's grass-feeding his beef, helping the environment/ecosystem?  are other countries running their food industry in the same way as us or does the US already control them too? how did Oprah win the fight against these monster food lawyers?<br /><br />If nothing else, after seeing this video, I want to do MORE than just buy local and/or organic, I want to speak up and speak out against these monopolies and the politicians who support them - why aren't they considered monopolies!?! I like cheap stuff, predictability, and consistency just as much as the next person, but people have to use their head and ask, ""at what cost?""  In this case, the cost is great - it's not just the environment, the animals, or our kids future, it's OUR LIVES at stake too - and that should appeal to even the most selfish individual.","Food, Inc"

I mean the unsanitary conditions, unhealthy diets, growth hormones, antiobiotics, etc.  It will truly make you question the food that you put on your plate.<br /><br />Just to be clear, this isn't a treehugger, save the animals movie.  It reports on the unsafe practices in our food system and helps to open your eyes to finding healthier sources (i.e. grass-fed beef instead of corn-fed beef, free-range chickens, etc.)<br /><br />If you care about what you put in your body, then this film is a must see.","Food, Inc"
111585,B002LBKDYE, A391YWY2W553W,5.0, Unbelievable Odor!  Everyone must see this film!,"On a recent roadtrip to California, we were on Interstate 5 and passed an area of feedlots near Stockton - the odor was unbelievable for miles before and after! Some of what we saw in the film is stuff we may have heard about, but to have it all put together coherently brings the information home, right to where we can see the results on our plates and in our refrigerator and cupboards(and in the nostrils of those unlucky enough to work or live near these giant feedlots!) It was mind-boggling and disturbing to really realize what keeps our food so cheap (relative to Europe or Japan or some other nations,) so disturbing we couldn't even watch the whole film in one sitting!<br />Food, INC, should be required viewing for everyone. Americans must think about what we are allowing to be done to us, our bodies, our country. There are so many questions the film stirs up; Why are the corn farms still being subsidized by taxpayers? Why is corn ethanol being promoted by the government when there are more efficient plants(sugarcane,sugarbeets,some grasses, etc)that can be used to make ethanol, and on and on. . .?","Food, Inc"

111591,B002LBKDYE, A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,4.0, Essential Viewing Even If It Is Repetitive,"Although highly informative and essential viewing for those interested in where, how and what's going on with the food that lands on their dinner table, FOOD, INC. follows in the footsteps (often lockstep) of another interesting treatise on American corporate food culture, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5IOWK"">The Future of Food</a>.<br /><br />Essentially, The Future of Food focused more directly on the Monsanto Company and how the first patent on a living thing (seeds) has changed the face of agriculture. Food, Inc. similarly rehashes this theme and includes the same information regarding Monsanto's strong arm tactics in keeping their patented seeds out of the hands of farmers who haven't purchased it. The problem, though, is you can't control the wind, and when seeds fall off trucks, or a few fly from one field to another, there's no way farmers can control it. And this is where Monsanto has done the unthinkable: they've built a group of strongmen attorneys to go after those farmers who's crops show Monsanto seeds, but haven't purchased them (nor tried to steal them, I might add). This strong arming has resulted in farmers being dragged through the court system at tremendous expense. And when you're David fighting Goliath, the odds are not in your favor if it takes two years to get to court and your attorney fees begin mounting.<br /><br />But where we begin to diverge in the two films (The Future of Food versus Food, Inc.) is in the meat department. Food, Inc. delves much more into the problems with the mass production of chickens, beef, and pigs (the three main meat staples) and how we've modified these creatures to fit our increasingly bad appetites and diets. Tyson Foods is one of the largest suppliers of chicken meat (you've probably seen their labels at your local store), but did you know that the chicken you're eating was born, grew and slaughtered in less than three months? And that the chicken you're forking into your mouth right now could probably only stand up, taking two or three steps, then collapse into a panting, feathered heap? Do you know why? Watch this film and learn.<br /><br />Another alarming trend is in beef industry where cattle are no longer allowed to graze, but are held in pens, wandering around on piles of manure, and being fed corn. Why? Because corn puts weight on much faster, but it also causes certain intestinal bacteria to flourish and, maybe mutate. Want to know why we've had so many E.Coli outbreaks in the past few decades? Watch this film and connect the dots.<br /><br />The brightest part of this film is that it is NOT anti-meat; it's anti-corporation. Big time. But only when it comes to our food. It wants you to learn why it's so important to shop at your local farmer's market. Why foods that are out of season are out of season FOR A REASON. Why corn has become so pervasive in our diets (and what its doing to our food and, in consequence, to us). Why free-range meat is much better for you (including the bacteria count). It wants to know why you're not asking why.<br /><br />This is a good eye-opener for those who eat at McDonald's every week (or day) and to those of us who shop at Piggly Wiggly or Safeway. Check out the meat before you bite into it.<br /><br />Even though Food, Inc. gave some good (but repetitive) information, it was a bit long. I think the film makers could've gotten away with about 15 minutes less time and made it just as effect in getting its message across. Still, I'm looking more closely at my food, which is what they want you to do.","Food, Inc"

You will never shop for meat (beef, pork) or poultry again in the same way, at the same places that you always have. Who knew? This is a real eye opener if you can watch all of it.

I only shop now at local butchers that buy locally from range free and grass fed animals. This is a must see for everyone.

111600,B002LBKDYE, A35HMLOGI89BG,5.0, Looking at our food from a whole new perspective,"The cover of this DVD states: ""You'll never look at dinner the same way again"" and it's true.  This movie follows the food from their sources to our supermarket.  The sordid method of mass production and the repulsive ways used to bring the food to our table as cheap as possible is beyond abomination.  Yes, I knew that mass production requires putting the livestock in large bins. What I didn't know was that overcrowding was to such an extent that animals were living on top of one another. Compassion and the humane treatment should be exercised whenever you are dealing with any livestock.<br /><br />As our food industry's corporations become more powerful, we come face-to-face with the little guys (small farmers and organic growers) who try to offer the public alternative choices...and how they were met with lawsuits and threats from these corporations.  There's nothing I need THAT BAD where I have to give my business to any company that uses threats!<br /><br />So now that I have this knowledge, what would I be doing differently? I won't be buying meat packages in bulk from my supermarket, that's for sure. I will be buying organic meat products from now on. Yes, they are more expensive but I'll be buying in smaller amounts. When I prepare meals for my family, it'll be quality over quantity.  And I think that's a very good thing!

111620,B002LBKDYE, A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,4.0, Somewhat Disjointed Survey of the Impact of Big Agribusiness on Food Safety.,"""Food, Inc."" strives to be an expos&eacute; of the American agricultural industry and a public service announcement that encourages the public to learn more about the food they eat and vote with their wallets at the grocery store. The film is narrated by Eric Schlosser, author of ""Fast Food Nation"", and Michael Pollan, author of ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"" and ""The Botany of Desire"", all books that in some way discuss how food has been transformed by human design and its results. ""Food, Inc."" tries to cover a lot of territory, resulting in a film that is a bit fractured and uneven. We get a lot more information about some facets of modern American agriculture than others.<br /><br />The impact of changes in how food is created in the past few decades, with increasing homogenization and the move from farms to a factory-created food supply, is a huge topic that could hardly be covered in a thousand pages, much less in an hour-and-a-half film. So ""Food, Inc."" concentrates on a few topics that director Robert Kenner must have thought dramatic enough to get the public's attention: the mistreatment of animals and farmers in the chicken industry, the rise in deadly e. coli 0157:H7 infections due to industrial beef production, and the obesity and diabetes that has resulted from cheap, abundant, federally subsidized corn.<br /><br />There is a lack of cohesion that does not always serve the arguments well, but the topics are related. For example, the high populations of e. coli in cows is due to their being fed corn instead of grass, because federal subsidies of corn allow companies to buy it at less than the price of production. Corn products are in nearly all processed foods, putting Americans on a very unhealthful diet of cheap calories from high fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates. The segment on the beef industry focuses on the causes and consequences of uniformity. When the dominant buyer of a product (e.g. McDonald's is the largest purchaser of beef and potatoes in the US) demands a uniform product, the industry must transform itself  to meet that demand.<br /><br />Some of the problems are unintended consequences of efforts to create an abundant and efficient food industry, while others are unethical or willfully ignorant behavior on the part of industry. The criticism of ""Food, Inc."" that I hear most frequently is that it doesn't present an alternative method of feeding the Earth's 6 billion inhabitants. But it doesn't need to. Sustainable agriculture works well on a large scale; monoculture is unsustainable by the agricultural industry's own admission; we are inundated with corn products not because we need them but because of subsidies; we produce too much food. Better, safer food is more expensive, but the prices of the junk are artificially depressed. And the federal government will be forced to reduce its agricultural subsidies in the coming decade anyway.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2009): Bonus features are 8 deleted scenes, 7 celebrity public service announcements about nutrition and food safety, a list of web site ""Resources"", an ad (text) for ""Food, Inc: The Book"", a theatrical trailer (2 min) and 2 featurettes. ""ABC News Nightline: You Are What You Eat"" (7 min) is a segment that aired June 16, 2009. Steve Ells, founder of Chipotle Grill, talks about the farm-raised meat that his restaurants use. ""The Amazing Food Detective"" (3 min) is a cartoon created by Kaiser Permanente to discourage children from eating junk food. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish.","Food, Inc"
111621,B002LBKDYE, A28EZNAC1L8VQV,5.0, Watch This,"This documentary explains how large companies maintain control over food production; unethical business practices are exposed and thoroughly investigated. I was very pleased that Food Inc made sure to include a bit of hope regarding the future of food production and consumer protection by explaining what we can do to change food industries through our choices - a lot of documentaries in this category are devoid of hope or calls to action. I am familiar with Fast Food Nation, Super Size Me, and most other popular junk-food-exposes and documentaries, but I still found Food Inc to have a lot of very interesting information. I highly recommend watching this. It is available streaming on Amazon, and also on Netflix.","Food, Inc"
111622,B002LBKDYE, A1TK6WNUIAEQRU,3.0, A Good Film - But It Could Have Been Better,"My wife and I watched the documentary Food, Inc. on PBS. We both enjoyed the first hour of the film, but we felt that it slipped off track during the last 30 minutes.<br /><br />The first hour focuses on the massive changes that have occurred in the ways that food reaches the American consumer. While our food packages often picture small farms on their labels, much of our food comes from a few large companies. Food, Inc. comments on a number of alarming practices that these companies use to increase food production and cut costs. Viewers will not look at their food in the same way after watching Food, Inc.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as mentioned, the filmmakers try to cover too much ground and Food Inc. loses focus in its final 30 minutes. Among other topics, the film covers the use of illegal immigrants in the food industry and includes a long segment on Monsanto's attempts to corner the market on certain seeds. These topics are worthwhile, but the filmmakers ""bit off more than they could chew"" by including them in Food, Inc.<br /><br />Food, Inc. is worth a look, but I can give it only a qualified recommendation.","Food, Inc"

111625,B002LBKDYE, A22I0VUGRKL4LE,5.0, Must See-very revealing,"This video will change the way you look at food. It will also alert you to how we are being taken advantage of by the large food producers. They look at us just about the same way they look at a beef cow. The ominous revelation of one multi-national company taking control of all the seeds in the world and crushing anyone who stands in their way is breath-taking. The callous disregard of small children dying of e-coli in favor of relaxed inspections and regulations for the sake of profits is painfully shown through the eyes of a conservative Republican mother turned food safety activist. All it took for her was the death of her two-year old son to learn the hidden story.<br /><br />Although some have accused the film makers of left-leaning bias, an independent study of the facts will confirm their even-handed treatment of the subject.<br /><br />Wake up and tell others.","Food, Inc"
111626,B002LBKDYE, A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,5.0, One of the most important films you'll ever watch,"I have been aware of Food, Inc. for some time, but watching it kept getting lost in the shuffle.  Now that I've finally watched it, I'm sorry that I let it get lost in the shuffle for so long.  Saying that it is one of the most important films you'll ever watch seems rather bombastic, but I'm serious about that claim.  I had already begun to change my buying habits at the grocery store and to begin to consider what I am putting my body and the bodies of my children, and this film made me more convinced than ever that this is not only the right thing to do, but also the only responsible thing to do.<br /><br />What was really telling for me was how the major corporations that were examined (Tyson's, Monsanto, etc.) refused to comment on the film.  When we walk into a U.S. grocery store, we have certain expectations about the quality of our foods.  When a film like this starts to poke holes into those illusions, and the major corporations concerned with these products refuse to comment, what should we, as consumers, think of their lack of response?  The current climate in the U.S. has shown us what happens when capitalism is allowed to run amok, when the dollar becomes more important than the person who is holding it.  It's not overstating things to say that what's going on in the food industry right now is every bit as alarming as what was going on in our financial institutions.<br /><br />I think what this film best illustrates is how our politicians (on both sides of the aisle), our government, and the heads of the departments we've entrusted to ensure our safety (USDA, FDA, et al.) have routinely sold us out for the sake of the almighty dollar.  The production of food has become so industrialized in this nation that the focus has shifted from ensuring safety to turning a blind eye in order to ensure the continued padding of the bottom line.  If Upton Sinclair could see what's going on today, he would despair over how we've learned nothing from his groundbreaking work, ""The Jungle"".<br /><br />My one issue with this film is its delicate handling of the new organic food industry.  I have switched to buying mostly organic foods, but I often wonder if this really is the solution to the problem, as it claims to be.  As these large organic companies (Stonyfield Farm, anyone?) start to grow to conglomerate status, do we run the risk of finding ourselves right back at square one?  I think the producers should have considered taking a harder look at these companies as well.<br /><br />Still, this is a film that is essential.  If Americans do not stand up and demand to know where their food comes from, demand to know why current practices are accepted, we all run the risk of a public health disaster.  This may sound dramatic, but one need only look at the rampant e. coli outbreaks to see that the proof is literally in the pudding.  We have grown far, far too complacent about the things we put into our mouths, trusting to regulatory agencies that are no longer operating under the mandate of ensuring public safety.<br /><br />The best lesson anyone can take from this film is that each and every one of us has the power.  Yes, these are huge corporations that command legions of lawyers and billions of dollars in profits, but where do those profits come from?  If we vote with our wallets, if we refuse to accept the presence of cloned meat and bio-engineered corn products in our foods, these companies will have no choice but to stand up and take notice.  We all need to go to the grocery store, pick up a container, read the ingredients, and walk away from anything that has unnatural ingredients in it. In this way, we can all become agents for the changes we want to see effected.","Food, Inc"
111627,B002LBKDYE, A1PMYOT17WOJQH,5.0, Must see.,"I just got my copy yesterday and watched it last night. Everyone needs to watch this dvd. It is a great review of what has happened to our food supply and our treatment of the animals and farmers who used to be the backbone of the country. This dvd is an education we all need to have.<br />Thank goodness I grew up on a farm/ranch where the animals were all treated humanly, fed what they were meant to eat and prepared for food with care and cleanness and no one ever got ecoli. Our animals were all well fed with the things God intended them to eat and kept in clean open spaces. Our hens sang as they laid their eggs and as they went about their day.<br />I was sick as I saw what people who only care about money have done to us. They make me want to be a vegetarian or at least go totally organic or buy from a local farmer where I can see the conditions they are kept under.<br />My husband worked for a rancher who kept a pig confinement.<br />After he would go in and tend the pigs there was no way you could be around him because of the stink even after a shower and change of clothes. We got a different job as soon as we could find one. The pigs however spent their whole lives in that stink.<br />My nephew worked at a feedlot for cattle in Nebraska. When he would come in the house for supper even after a change of clothes and a shower you could not sit by him and eat supper because of the stink. The cows however were in that until the day they went to slaughter, up to their knees.<br />In this dvd I saw how the chicken confinement sheds are too. What a disgrace and a crime against God's creatures.<br />THen at the last to show how Monsanto has sued and broken the farmers who tried to keep our food supply clean and our corn and soybeans safe to eat.<br />In what we think is the greatest country in the world the corruption and graft is inexcusable. We have allowed the big companies to poison us and our children and put God's creatures though untold suffering.<br />You must see this dvd if you care about your self, your family and the helpless creatures they torture to death.<br />God bless Eric Schlosser and the people who made this dvd to make us aware of what is happening.","Food, Inc"
111628,B002LBKDYE, AT376PQYOI8F8,5.0," If you eat food, you MUST SEE THIS","An eye-opener!  A must-see movie that will get you thinking about many issues besides the food and its industry- like  power, justice, and truth in this world.  Unbelievable.  Despite the heartbreaking stories about how farmers are being bullied and put out of business, there are many positive messages shared like how changes in attitude toward organic and 'natural' food has become mainstream and an extremely profitable industry.","Food, Inc"
111629,B002LBKDYE, A2ZGHESQDCI77M,5.0, POWER to the PEOPLE!,"Simply put, this is an outstanding documentary.  Not only does it give the viewer an inside peek into a very unhealthy, and frightening industry, it offers consumers some steps to take toward promoting change.  The bottom line is, if we do not buy inferior products, we will send a message to the food industry that we demand change. Our purchase power is our only leverage, since it is clear the government agencies are NOT on our side, and they don't have much regulatory authority, even if they were. When even Wal-Mart is now stocking some 'organic' products due to customer demand, we know we CAN be heard.  In fact, we need to be even louder, as we just say, 'NO!'<br /><br />This movie will leave you sickened by the amount of toxins we are ingesting, and the foods that are barren of nutritional content.  The statistics regarding insulin resistance and the number of diabetics expected, in this, and the next generations, are staggering.  If we look further down the road, at our already fragile health-care system,  we can readily see that with these dire health predictions, due to poor nutrition, that any system, new, or old, will not be sustainable.<br /><br />As the old saying goes, 'you can tell how civilized a population is by the way it treats its animals.' Well, it goes without saying, that we are failing miserably in this area.  However, watching the poor, enslaved workers in these processing plants, is just as uncivilized, and, a blight against humanity.<br /><br />When you finish this film, you will never put another morsel in your mouth, without thinking of the poor animals so cruelly sacrificed, the subservient farmer, those in the processing plants, the toxins ingested, or the big fat cats, who are only out to make a buck. And, don't even get me started on the soybean monopoly. This part of the story will break your heart and make you wish you could never touch soy again, in protest; but we can't avoid it---and the industry knows it. Just like we can't possibly avoid CORN, or its byproducts.<br /><br />I hope this movie will make more people think about how citizens are being manipulated for the wealth of a few.  It makes it clear we can make a difference, with a little work, and shedding the denial that has become our comfort zone.<br /><br />We must remember, when we sit down to eat that juicy steak, that the cow didn't commit suicide for us.  And, the undocumented worker, that handled the meat? He may now be in a police car, after a decade, or more, of doing a horrendous job, 'one of the most dangerous in America,' just to survive. I wouldn't doubt that they are suddenly turned in when they become burned-out and less productive, or have sustained injury.  They are considered disposable. There is a dirty story behind every morsel, before it goes through our lips, for which, we must not remain ignorant.<br /><br />Knowledge is power!","Food, Inc"
111630,B002LBKDYE, A11QN0RGD43RRJ,3.0, Good Movie - But Nothing New,"I am a huge fan of documentaries - especially those that have a story arc - keep the viewer engaged with facts, opinions, historical comparison/contrast, etc...<br /><br />FOOD, Inc. does a fair job of this - I like their approach (and the telling ""non-interviews"" by the big food players says a lot about their collective guilt).  However, as a warning to all who HAVEN'T been living under a rock the past 10 years: there is nothing new here.<br /><br />...parody commences here....<br />WHAT?  Cows are raised in filthy feedpens?<br />WHAAAAT?  Chickens are overcrowded and live a brief, miserable life?<br />WHAT-what?  Big food companies pressure their farm suppliers to standardized practices (and breeds and varieties)?<br />HUH?  WHAT?  All of this is potentially unhealthy?<br />WHATTA-What?  This is yet another example of man's curse of bending nature against her will, with potentially devastating consequences?*<br />WHAAAAAAAT-What-WHAT?!!!

111634,B002LBKDYE, A5IN3UTJXMGMM,5.0, An Eye Opener,"I saw this movie two years ago and it was life changing.<br />I went from a meat eater who only sort of thought organic food was a good idea.<br />To a firm believer that farm to fork was the way to go, and the only way to avoid some of the nastiness that gets into our meat.<br />Seeing the way animals are treated (more like a science experiment than a living breathing thing) will make you realize that McDonald's isn't necessarily doing you a favor by having a $1 menu.<br />The rate in which Americans are becoming unhealthy and overweight is astonishing, but Food Inc really puts it into perspective.<br />My favorite part of the movie is with Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms (in Virginia) and he is just the most intelligent and profound thinker.<br /><br />A great accompaniment to this is Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan.","Food, Inc"
111635,B002LBKDYE, A3QBMOLLKW5CVP,4.0, An informative look at where our food comes from,"I thought this movie was a really informative look at where our food comes from.

This has definitely made me think about my food choices going forward.","Food, Inc"
111636,B002LBKDYE, A1GNLHCCJX5P8I,5.0, Lifting the Veil,"Just looking at the cover of this DVD will give you an idea of what lays ahead; however, the magnitude is astounding.  What you think you know, and what you actually know are two total worlds apart and this DVD proves it.  It takes what we have heard in the news and looks deeper, opening the doors to issues that have long since been considered taboo to some.  Images of abuse, neglect, and blatant disrespect for not only the animals, but also the farmers, workers, and environment by big companies is brought to light.  Companies like Perdue and Tyson, major retailers of chicken products, are just two of a handful of names that are mentioned and investigated.<br /><br />This DVD gives you an all access pass into the inner workings of our food systems.  They take you by the hand and then throw you head first into the ugly truth behind the pretty packaging that you find in supermarkets.  That farm and cow you see on the label is actually a plant that uses a false front to hide the horrible treatment of both animals and, in some cases, the employees as well.  Cows stuffed so closely together that there is no room to breathe, manure all over the floor, caking their legs and their hides, as they are forced forward to the slaughter.  Chickens locked away with no light, forced to eat foods that make them grow too fast.  Their bodies are so heavy that their bones, which have been unable to keep up with the accelerated growth rate, can not handle the pressure.  They lay in the floor after only a couple of steps, and sometimes, they never again get up.  Workers wade through the mass of chickens who struggle to  get out of there way as the men and women retrieve the dead carcasses of the chickens and throw them to the side to be collected and dumped.<br /><br />The world runs on the principle of supply and demand.  With the introduction and advances of the fast food industry, the meat industry has been hard pressed to come up with the supply to meet the demand.  The answer they have chosen not only affects the animals, but us as well, though we don't know it.  The food companies have done a wonderful job of laying a veil over our eyes, preventing us from seeing what exactly goes into our food and how it gets from point A to point B and then to us.  Food, inc. rips away the veil and it will leave you speechless.<br /><br />I must warn you, though.  If you are easily upset or queasy, be careful when watching this movie.  It is interesting, informative, but also intense.  I will recommend it to my family and friends in hopes that they too will see what is happening and move to make a change.  This film shows that we can't depend on the government to change the standards, only ourselves.<br /><br />If you watch it, don't forget to see what it is trying to show you.  Take a deep look and install these images in your memory for when you go to the store next time.  When you're standing before the meat section, internally debating about what you want to fix that night, stop and read the label.  Look for where it is made, what is in it, and keep going from there.<br /><br />Watch.  Listen.  Learn.<br /><br />Most importantly...<br /><br />Apply!  Apply what you learn to your future choices so that the food industry has no choice but to change the way they handle our food.  The substance that goes in not only our mouths, but the mouths of our families.  We have the right to good food, and this DVD is a good starting point to show you how!","Food, Inc"
111637,B002LBKDYE, A3MSB96N5TYC2B,5.0, This Will Change How You Grocery Shop,"I have watched this several times and it is now being passed among friends. I could not keep it to myself. There are a lot of things that I follow such as Monsanto, GMO in our food chain, and the not so pleasant way we have turned animals into food. It is not a movie to make you become vegetarian, but lets you see how the subsidized farming has replaced the family farmer and how regulations are killing the smaller but healthier farms. This movie opened my eyes to so much more! OMG...really? After seeing this, my shopping habits changed yet again. My family has been fervent about growing our own food and getting out of the ""chain store"" shopping as much as we can afford. It is a very well documented and presented movie. Not as gross as the PETA films, but certainly gets the point across. Just a side note: My husband and I were in Texas last year and we drove past some cattle ""fields"" similar to those shown in this movie. It was horrible to see in on film, it was horrifying to see it for real. This stuff is not made up. Watch it, but you might want to keep a barf bag handy.","Food, Inc"

If organic, local, or self grown I eat it.  I am scaling back on how much beef I buy.  I only purchase organic or free range chicken and eggs.  This movie really shines a light on how pathetic our food industry really is and how bad it has to be for most of our bodies and the sad state the animals are put in.","Food, Inc"
111642,B002LBKDYE, A3CQFNRZIFRK71,5.0, Excellent!,"I am a vegetarian and have been aware of the inhumane and torturous practices innocent animals are subject to, for a long time.  While this fact is very painful to me it doesn't seem to bother most people who remain consuming meat from the meat companies.  However, I believe the film is very informative especially for most people who don't mind animals being tortured but perhaps (hopefully!) at least become concerned about how those terrible practices lead to diseases such as E. coli, which can lead to death.<br /><br />As a vegetarian it was a painful film to watch but very informative and I'm glad I watched it, in fact I believe everyone should watch it!

111643,B002LBKDYE, A38MYFMYVGBKJ5,5.0, nicely done,"The quote that stood out in this movie I think was when they spoke of attempting to separate us from a knowledge of our food supply.  Our family recently switched to using a local sustainably grown farm in our area for our meat and after this movie I am glad to have done that.  The gentleman from Walmart was great when he spoke on how much power the consumer has ( I know I have taken that for granted many times ).  In short a food related business cannot be run like the rest of business.  Faster is not better, bigger is not better every time, HEALTHY nutrient rich and HUMANELY treated is better.  I would fall under the ""capitalist"" and somewhat conservative mindset from a financial perspective  but to apply that type of mentality to food and animals is a terrible mismanagement of resources as well as cruel and sick; and I very much appreciate this type of work.  Michael Pollan has written a number a great books on this topic and I appreciate the amount of time and energy these men and women have put into such an important issue.  Food and health are something worth paying the price for up front in dollars both to make a statement about what type of things we value as people, as well as for our long term well being.","Food, Inc"
111644,B002LBKDYE, A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0,4.0," Hard to watch, no matter who you are","I have been a vegetarian for almost all of my adult life and a vegan for the last few years.  I started out for ethical reasons, but even if I stopped caring tomorrow I would still eschew animal products.  The way they are produced is just too scary.  I've been reading about these issues for over twenty years, so there was little that surprised me.  For me, the value of the film was showing the human costs, both direct and indirect, in our food system.<br /><br />Let's back up- this film and many others like it would have you believe that McDonalds, Walmart and Tyson invented the model for the farm, restaurant and supermarket as factory.  They didn't.  We've been mechanizing our food systems to the best of our ability since we started trading in and consuming sugar.  The scary part now is that we can do it so much more ""efficiently"" than we could before because our technology has improved so much.<br /><br />The hell of sugar was the way it not only depended on slaves but literally destroyed them.  Slavery has been outlawed, but the conditions under which laborers in the food industry work are little better than what the slaves labored in.  One of the farmers makes the point that ""Big Food"" previously depended on African American men to, literally, do their dirty work.  Now it's undocumented workers.  One of the prices our country pays for cheap food.<br /><br />The story about the little boy who died after eating contaminated hamburgers- and then the inability of the corporation to apologize- drew both tears and indignant gasps.  And well it should.  Even worse, what people can say about food companies- Food, Inc- is heavily restricted.  When someone can sew Oprah Winfrey for speaking out against a food company, no one is safe.  And that's a shame.<br /><br />It was the story about the small family trying to balance the costs of food and health care that showed what the true cost of our food system really is.  Other organizations have cited that we spend the same 26% of our incomes on healthcare and food combined as we did forty years ago.  The difference is that we used to spend 18% on food and 8% on healthcare; now it's reversed.  Actually, the biggest difference is that we used to have a better quality of life when we did.<br /><br />It's a powerful film, especially for children, especially for meat eaters (although the message is emphatically not that everyone has to become a vegetarian).  But... it's not the comprehensive indictment of the food system I thought it would be.  They focus on one quirky, independent farmer as part of the solution.  What about more about CSAs?  What about how to make all of that work in a city?  (It felt like this, as well as many other films on the subject, was talking to someone in the suburbs.)  And while I understood what they were saying about Walmart being potentially part of the solution, there's A LOT more to that story, such as how vulnerable businesses become when 40 to 60% of their business becomes dependent on Walmart- and keeping them happy.<br /><br />This is a very good work and it should be required viewing in school.  It's just not the final, most comprehensive resource.","Food, Inc"

It's a MUST see if you have any concern for your well being.<br /><br />As I was watching this thought provoking DVD, deep within my soul I felt saddened and ashamed for knowing that I have contributed to a living hell for so many animals that are factory farmed for my consumption. During the movie, I had an earth shattering revelation that I was a hypocrite... I fight for animals rights and environmental causes, yet I was blindly heading to the market for my families pre-packaged, guilt-free steaks & chicken, and processed foods.<br /><br />I adore all animals, and I respect their lives. I respect Mother Earth. Yet I ate meat 3-5 times a week, and had no problem serving food from a box. All my life I have been a ""flexitarian"", but this DVD has changed my life and my diet. Actually, it threw me over the edge. I will no longer eat meat washed in ammonia, chickens washed in chlorine, and will no longer eat from a box. How dare these huge corporations think that we are their guinea pigs... willfully feeding cows 28 million pounds of antibiotics a year that end up in our bodies, feeding these animals genetically modified corn instead of grass (or hey), serving the American public ""downed cow"", diseased and sick chickens, who live their entire lives in knee deep feces. Welcome to their science experiment. They do not know the short or long term effect that their practices are having on the American people consuming their products, and knowing that that they don't care is sickening as well. All the information in this DVD should have been available to us consumers years ago. These corporations should have an open door policy and yet they hide and deceive what they are doing with the food products we are sticking in our face. I am now convinced, more than ever, that these corporations are the leading cause of most of our illnesses, and our food addictions. This DVD is your wake up call people. Ask yourself, who is in charge of your life?<br /><br />Know wonder these Corporation's had ""no comment"" for this documentary and did not want us to see the ugly truth behind their practices... no one in their right mind would think, ""Um Beef... Sounds delicious!"" I am so thankful that the ""veil"" of truth has been removed and now I can actually understand why Americans should eat organic, farm raised, free range, grass fed animals, and buy locally grown fruits and vegetables. I really get it now!<br /><br />This DVD will make you sit and wonder; How could all this be true?, How could ""they"" allow this to go on?, Where are the food police?, and Does any one respect LIFE anymore? Is it all about the money for these corporate giants?... the answer to that one is easy to answer after viewing this wonderfully made DVD.

This film highlights the corrupt practices of major food companies, including Tyson and Monsanto. Viewers get an insight into animal cruelty, GMOs, and the exploitation of farmers. To my surprise, it didn't advocate veganism, but I think that makes it more appealing to a larger audience. If you watch this movie, you won't be coerced by propaganda.

Its true - we are the consumers, and what we purchase, the choices we make, are our votes.  I'm vegan and choose organic over non when possible... even household products, I will buy those which are more environmentally friendly.  I am one person, but if we all did the same, we would have a huge impact, as the filmmaker suggests.

111680,B002LBKDYE, A1K9KNLTSJF7Q9,5.0, The consequences of greed,"That a movie has to be made to inform the American public where food comes from is a remarkable testament to how much life has changed in the past century.<br /><br />Michael Pollun makes this point about his book, The Omnivore's Dilemma, but it applies equally well to this 2008 film from Emmy award-winning producer/writer/director Robert Kenner.  Food, Inc presents little revelatory to those interested in issues of health, environment, food safety, or animal welfare.  What it does well is pull together many of these strands to weave an informative, non-polemical, and visually captivating introduction for the many millions not yet aware of the hidden costs of the modern food industry.<br /><br />Early on in the film an agricultural engineer asks, what's wrong with maximizing yield?  The answer is found in the many stories that follow but is summarized best by a free range rancher who observes that if the meat packing industry treats animals as little more than commodity, if it treats them as nothing more than a package of protein to be manipulated for profit, then it is most unlikely these same companies, these same people, have more benign or even enlightened attitudes towards employees or customers.<br /><br />The CEO of Stonyfield offers a way forward that balances yield with stewardship, commerce with compassion.  A lot of his like-minded friends are aghast at his ""collusion"" with the corporate enemy, but he reminds them that because Wal-Mart customers buy his yogurt, that much less pollution is prevented from entering the environment.  Wal-Mart officials confirm they began selling organic yogurt because of consumer demand.<br /><br />One aspect of the fuller story depicted only indirectly is the effect US companies and government have on food economics, policies, and consumption in countries beyond its borders.  It's not just the American consumer that is getting screwed.  Waistlines and diabetes are increasing in countries to which US-style fast-food, commercial food products, and food business models are exported.  It also fails to mention the simplest solution for reducing greenhouse gases, deforestation, food borne illness, suffering of sentient beings, and hunger - eating more plants and eating less meat.<br /><br />If you are interested in additional film resources, a few worth checking out include:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053ZHZI2"">Forks Over Knives</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014BQR74"">How to Cook Your Life</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V5IOWK"">The Future of Food</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028N3TW8"">The World According to Monsanto</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKAU"">Fast Food Nation</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EP8EOY"">King Corn</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QX0LE6"">EARTHLINGS</a><br /><br />#","Food, Inc"
111681,B002LBKDYE, A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,5.0, Brilliant expose of food industry cover-up,"Food Inc. is the new brilliant documentary which should shock all Americans about what has become of our food supply. It begins with the camera slowly panning through a supermarket, focusing on row after row of sanitized food products. The point is made that there are only a few multi-national corporations who actually produce the vast majority of food products seen on our supermarket shelves today. They seek to lull a complacent public into believing that the food we eat is wholesome and is produced in the simple spirit of our agrarian forefathers. Of course, we soon see that their marketing seeks to cover up a much more sinister reality.<br /><br />Food Inc. first focuses on chicken production. The filmmakers got a hold of one chicken producer who raises chickens for Tyson Foods, perhaps the largest poultry provider in the country. The chicken producer was more than willing to show his behind-the scenes-operation until he was told by Tyson to shut up. It's obvious they didn't want him to show how the chickens were raised--thousands of them shut up in a building devoid of sunlight and being fed with cheap corn products to fatten them up. Today's chickens were contrasted with the chickens of yesteryear and today they are twice the size. They were able to interview a woman who raised chickens for Perdue. She apparently was fed up and refused to go along with Perdue's directives to raise her chickens using mass production techniques. But even with her more humane efforts, many of her chickens were dying due to antibiotic resistance. The woman herself indicated that she had developed health problems as a result of contact with these antibiotics. One of the film's revelations I wasn't aware of, was that these small businessmen are at the mercy of the conglomerates and if they don't do what they say, they'll be put out of business.<br /><br />Another segment involves a food safety crusader who lost her three year old to E Coli contamination after eating a tainted hamburger. She sponsors ""Kevin's Law"", named after her fallen son but gets little support in Congress due to the lobbying efforts of the food industry who have prevented passage of the bill.<br /><br />More shocking revelations abound including an extended segment on just how pervasive corn has not only been utilized as a cheap source of food for livestock (leading to the proliferation of manure that gets into our food supply) but also how it's used to create new processed food with little nutritional value. We also meet a lower middle-class Hispanic family who can't avoid eating fast food even though they're aware how unhealthy it is for them. The father is suffering from early onset Diabetes which is becoming one of the fastest growing health problems linked to eating unhealthy meals of processed food. The family not only doesn't have the time to shop for better foods but they don't have the money--so they end up going to McDonald's instead.<br /><br />Immigrant workers are also exploited by the multinationals who used to recruit farmers in Mexico who could no longer compete against the big food producers in the U.S. They shipped the workers here in droves where they're now economically dependent on these corporations despite working in horribly unsanitary conditions. Now with anti-immigrant sentiment running wild, a few token workers are rounded up everyday to appease the public and the corporations are never charged with hiring illegal help.<br /><br />The most shocking information we learn is the role of Monsanto Corporation monopolizing the soybean market. As a result of a Supreme Court decision, Monsanto now holds a 'patent' on their genetically modified soybean. They've ended up destroying the careers of small farmers by suing them for violation of their patents (Monsanto's soybean ends up as part of the farmers' crop so they're accused of infringement). What's worse is the long line of government officials, former Monstanto employees, who are now (and have been) in the highest positions in the Food and Drug Administration responsible for food safety oversight. Ten years ago, there were 50,000 food safety inspections a year--last year the FDA only authorized 9,000. And these officials weren't only appointed during the Bush administration. President Clinton also had a healthy share of these former Monsantoites working at the FDA.<br /><br />While Monsanto is clearly the biggest villain among many, Food Inc. attempts to highlight more productive people in the 'system'. One interview focuses on an organic livestock producer who feeds his cattle grass and not corn. While it's clear he treats his livestock better than the conglomerates, I'm not a believer in the idea of 'compassionate slaughter'. Why eat meat at all? There's also an interview with the president of Stonyfield Farms, famous for organic yogurt. He ended up selling out to Walmart but he feels it was a good thing since 'better' products were made available to the public on a mass scale. Again, the sale of any kind of dairy products (organic or not) is not a good thing in the long run for one's health.<br /><br />Food Inc. attempts to end on an optimistic note. It's up to the consumer to choose more healthy food. The example of successful consumer action is cited in the case of the tobacco industry which was brought down after the public woke up to the deleterious effects of its products. Until the public is willing to look behind the veil of unhealthy food production in this country, they will continue to enjoy bad meals at McDonald's and other nefarious 'restaurants'. Food Inc. is one of those rare documentaries which can open peoples' eyes--and that's not easy to do!","Food, Inc"
111682,B002LBKDYE, AF4WMT59J1L57,5.0," Highly informative, not too biased","I am a HUGE fan of Michael Pollan's ""The Omnivore's Dilemna"" and thus am delighted at this new documentary. Apart from pretty much bringing to life the first 2/3 of that book, the film also presents more information concerning the battle against industrial food companies. It pushed further into the symbiotic relationship between the government and these food companies, and the legal confrontation from the people.<br /><br />Thankfully, this was NOT an anti-meat documentary, as it devoted a lot of time to critique the corn and soybean industries, especially the Monsanto monopoly. The film provided several tips on how to become more knowledgable about your food, how to buy and eat healthier, and what kind of laws are needed for the food industry to improve (research: Kevin's Law). It showed you the problems that you should know about (CAFOs and other industrial animal plants), the problems that you probably don't know about (veggie libel laws, the Monsanto soybean monopoly), and the present alternatives (Polyface Farms). It covers an amazing range of issues, and would only be better if filmmakers were able to get the corporations on camera. Unexpectedly, companies like Purdue, Tyson, Smithfield, and Monsanto were not compliant.<br /><br />The most important message is know where your food comes from. Only by being informative can you decide for yourself what you want to eat.","Food, Inc"
111683,B002LBKDYE, A9S1WIB5XVLL1,5.0, To Educate Yourself about What you eat is to Empower Yourself,"It's very scary to know about some of the results the government don't want you to know about genetically modified foods... mold in the blood caused by seedless grapes & watermelon.  There is a microscope that magnifies the blood 16,000x its size.  Of course the general health industry doesn't use it nor will the government allow them to have it because of what you may find in your blood stream caused by eating GMF.<br /><br />There's been a couple of test done using McDonald's meat & french fries.  You know that food when left out will usually mold and rot.  Apparently somebody kept a McDonald's quarter pounder and french fries for over 3 years in a metal lunch box.  The results... the fries look the same as it did when it left the fryer and the hamburger didn't change at all.  The meat may have shrunk just a little and the bread became slightly brittle and crumbled when handled.  ""What is McDonald feeding our children?"" asked the producer of that film.  I can't prove if what she says is true or not, however I left some fries in my car for several months and the fries never molded.  It was still greasy and salty but not a speck of mold on it.  You can view this by going to [...] and search under McDonald.<br /><br />I personally will not eat meat anymore after watching Food Inc.  I was slowly moving in this direction anyway, however after viewing Food Inc. it made the process much easier.  Should I ever fall off the wagon, I will only eat cattle fed on grains or classified as organic. I will only buy locally grown foods or grow my own and buy organic if at all possible.  I will pay extra to ensure I know what is going into my body.<br /><br />If you believe our government has our best interest, think again.  They've poisoned our water, shove chemicals into our bodies by promoting drugs (treat the symptoms, not find the cure), force vaccines onto our children which I truly believe is the route to all our major illnesses today, allow chemicals into our food, knowing it's harmful effects, and made sure they will not be held responsible by passing laws in their favor. Big corporation, UGH!!!!!!<br /><br />If you don't watch out for your children or yourself, who will?  Certainly not our government.","Food, Inc"
111684,B002LBKDYE, A2XQMGE2YY88DC,4.0, Informative and Visually Compelling,"The documentary ""Food Inc."" treads familiar ground but in a visually compelling way that gives viewers glimpses, snapshots, and an overall picture of the problems of our food economy today.<br /><br />The food economy is an impersonal monolithic system, and everything is interconnected -- the corporations seeking efficiency and profit, the consumers seeking the most calories at the cheapest price, the federal government that subsidizes this economy and winks at its misdeeds -- to create overabundance, wealth, and diversity of food that is not sustainable in the long-term, and which is already pernicious and destructive in its present form. It is what it is, as the popular phrase goes.<br /><br />But ""Food Inc."" re-casts the food economy as an epic struggle between evil and good. The bad guys are the few corporations that control all the food in the United States. They mistreat animals, caging them in crowded pens where pigs and cows stand and sleep on their own manure. They hire illegal migrants who cannot unionize to work in their processing plants (and when a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment hits the United States the plant managers turn in a dozen immigrants a day to federal authorities, which in turn must maintain fear and discipline on the assembly line). Their heavy use of chemicals, fertilizers, and pesticides are destroying the environment, and their industrial large-scale food production leads often enough to virus outbreaks, such as e.coli. Because they control the supply chain these companies also prey on farmers, endlessly thinking of ways of control them. The heavy investment in buying barns to raise chicken is one such way, but a much more controversial way is how companies such as Monsanto have patented seeds and used the legal system to blackmail and extort farmers into using their patented products. They have won heavy government subsidies for crops that are fundamental to their bottom line (mainly corn, which is used to manufacture high-fructose corn syrup, a sweetener in many processed foods), and with these subsidized crops are able to make processed foods so cheaply that consumers find it cheaper to buy bad food than it is to eat healthy food (in a very good scene in the documentary a poor family goes to Burger King to order from their one-dollar take-out menu, and then goes to a supermarket where they discover they can't afford to buy fresh vegetables). And to ensure their monopoly on food production and prices food industry executives have implanted themselves into America's federal agencies charged with protecting consumer safety (Clarence Thomas was a Monsanto lawyer, and as a Supreme Court Justice he wrote the majority decision which permitted Monsanto to patent seeds).<br /><br />It's hard to imagine how such a powerful monolithic system can be defeated, but as ""Fast Food Nation"" author Eric Schlosser reminds us the tobacco industry fifty years ago also seemed invincible. But consumers, voting with their pocketbook and at the polls, broke their shield of invincibility.<br /><br />The tobacco industry and the food economy are not accurate comparisons. Tobacco can kill anyone, but it's mainly the poor who are obese and unhealthy (income is the best predictor of obesity). Second-hand smoke is dangerous, but as long as the poor stay bloated and overweight in their poor neighborhoods the rich won't mind. The unfortunate fact of life is that the price differential between eating healthy and eating junk food is tremendous -- a differential that's too much for poor people already burdened by their mortgage and their health bills. It will take tremendous will, discipline, and sacrifice for middle-class voters to force government to begin subsidizing healthy food that benefits everyone. Or these same middle-class voters can just shop at Whole Foods.<br /><br />Something tells me the fresh air of a farmers' market is far more appealing to white middle-class voters than the dark manure of Washington.","Food, Inc"

I am, also, passing on a copy to friends that are ""the working poor"" that are eating junk food.<br />  I raised chickens 40 years ago and sold a dozen eggs for $1.00 to a high of $1.50. Now a dozen eggs is frequently $1.50 and for organic $3.00.  Something is wrong with the economics of 40 years and a tiny dollar change.<br />  I would like to know how law suits against ""free speech in criticizing large food companies""  has been allowed to happen in this country?<br />WHERE are the multi-famous lawyers that talk the 'big talk' against corporations hiding?  and, why are the lawyers not suing the massive food corporations?<br />  I am glad that this movie did  not blame the poor cow and chickens.

111686,B002LBKDYE, A39NYF00CMJ1K5,5.0, Time to get our heads out of the sand,"Ignorance really is bliss.  I was aware, to an extent of how inhumane animals were treated.  I was aware of Monsantos evil ways.  But this movie still packed enough of a punch and forced me to open my eyes a little more.  Actually seeing the conditions of the animals THAT WE EAT, before they are slaughtered was just sad.  The people that work for these companies treat their employees the same way.  These are people that probably have no morals of any sort, nor do they value the human life.  It's disgusting.  After years of evolution and working hard to create rights and laws, people are still working in deplorable conditions.  Seriously, is any of this necessary, except for big monopolies to pad their pockets?<br /><br />Of course it's pro-organic, but do you really want to eat a chicken that is living in so much filth that it's fed antibiotics its entire life?  Do you want a chicken that is loaded with growth hormones?  How about a cow that's stuck in a pen on top of thousands of other cows, eating a diet of genetically modified corn and then killed inhumanely?  We should all be forced to think about what we eat and try and take action against what's really going on.  I think this country needs an overhaul of the system.  I think it needs to just blow up (come to a head), so we can go back to simpler times.<br /><br />I'm glad this movie focused on the subject at hand, without using gore and blood.  If you want to see that, go watch an action flick.  And for those that say it's biased and one sided.  Of course it is.  Just like any other controversial subject.  Take what you want from it and discard the rest.","Food, Inc"
111687,B002LBKDYE, A3S3R88HA0HZG3,5.0," Holy cow, is this what we're really eating?","I thought I knew a lot about nutrition and the food that I eat, but there were some things in this documentary that surprised even me.  I think one of the most eye opening things about it was in the beginning where they show aisles and aisles of supermarket space all filled with a seemingly endless variety of foods.  But as the movie continues you come to find out that there are very few different ingredients in all of these foods, a high percentage of it is corn, soy and chemicals.  After watching it, I looked at the labels in my local grocery store and was amazed at how true that is.<br /><br />The one argument in favor of processed foods in my mind was that there's more of a variety than the whole natural foods that my family normally eats.  Sometimes it's hard to be creative without resorting to processed ingredients, but maybe that's just laziness on my part.  After watching this and seeing not only the origin of some of the foods we eat, but the social and environmental implications of foods we purchase, I can see that it's worth it in so many ways to go out of my way to buy only whole, unprocessed foods.  The extra money spent on organic is well spent.  We need to start voicing our opinions with what we spend our money on because according to this film, that's the only voice we have.<br /><br />Coincidentally, I just finished reading a techno-thriller novel <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525951571"">Freedom (TM)</a> that has parts that tie into this same subject, people taking back the right to a clean and safe food supply.

111688,B002LBKDYE, A1DG75OT3Y49EM,5.0, Terrifying,"We Americans think that something is going on between Washington and Wall Street. We think something is going on between Washington and Oil Companies. We think. We think. But there isn't much we can do and there doesn't seem to be anyone willing to connect the dots and hold people accountable. What I didn't realize was that our food was another area where Washington and powerful companies are basically conspiring to control us. Things like the soy bean market being cornered by Monsanto and the stripping of the powers of the FDA are shocking! And those are only two of the long series of issues that this film illuminates.<br /><br />I'd never read any of the books that are cited in this film, but love a good documentary (via Netflix streaming,) and when this one showed up with high ratings I had to watch it. What I found was a documentary that shows just how ignorant we Americans are. I know that after watching this film I am going to pay far closer attention to where my food comes from and buy local when I can. I also found that even though I was very hungry today, the thought of eating fast food made my stomach churn. If you wonder why, watch the film. I highly recommend that you do.","Food, Inc"

It was horrifying to see how much control lies in so few hands of our food supply. Particularly appalling is that Monsanto make criminals out of innocent people who choose to grow their own seeds (and presumably organic farmers too).<br /><br />Easy to see how the poor are disadvantaged in this situation. With the food supply being so grotesquely altered, and then subsidised, is it any wonder that illnesses like diabetes are going through the roof.<br /><br />A wholesome reminder on a personal level to adhere to a healthy, organic (when one can afford it) diet, and to always take a sceptical view of the authorities.<br /><br />Wholly endorse the sentiments at the end and would encourage everyone to take responsibility for what they put in their mouths, demand organic and demand that the government, the FDA and the multinationals like Monsanto GET OUT OF OUR KITCHEN.","Food, Inc"

111692,B002LBKDYE, A3B4TA7LWFHQKL,5.0, Absolutely staggering,"Even if only half of what is in this documentary is true, this is a staggering expose of the American food industry. Beyond the indefensibly cruel way we treat other living creatures is the realization of that our own craving for cheap, fast food is undermining our health in very dangerous ways, not just by making us obese, but by creating new, antibiotic resistant strains of eColi and other pathogens. The small American farmer is under attack as well. While I admit I'm a vegetarian and so may be biased, I'm vowing to buy more organic whenever I can. If I wasn't a vegetarian already, this documentary would have convinced me to become one, although I do think the film gives a fair shake to organic farmers who raise livestock and isn't necessarily pro-veg.

The truth is in this film, and it is an ugly truth. Americans have been tricked, backstabbed, lied to, and poisoned by the very people we have elected into our government. Inhumane treatment of our livestock and inhumane treatment of our peoples. We think we have no choice but too fall victim to their control of our diets and our health, but we do have a choice and the power to change it. The more Americans who watch this film the better. Even young teens should know the truth, they are the future, the more people that know the truth, the more power we have as citizens. Knowledge is power.

Frankly, if they ever remotely *dream* of coming after me for growing real food, the way it is meant to be grown, I'll slam them with such a return.  They deserve no better.  I DON'T want their ills in MY food.  If their garbage trespasses here, they're in for it.  I certainly don't want it here, and it is their responsibility for keeping it from crossing property lines.  Serious.<br /><br />Or are they so omnipotent that such distinctions don't matter?<br /><br />Piff.  Right now I'm just a backyard gardener, with too much shade to count (though I do what I can), but watching this film, I'd ANGRY and not going stand aside when truth counts more.<br /><br />This is a SUPERB film.

111697,B002LBKDYE, A3T0OTH5072YRE,4.0, Food Inc.,"I've always liked knowing where my food came from.  Even if it does give that creature a face, I think it makes me appreciate everything more. That being said, life happens and I find myself shopping at the regular supermarket more and more due to finances and time constraints.  And I've gotten away from purchasing my food from local sources.  Watching this movie reminded me of just why I adopted those better practices in the first place, and its time to start getting back to doing so.<br /><br />There are several parts to this movie involving the food industry, but they all have a prevalent message.  And indeed, the first couple words of the documentary kind of sum it all up with expressing how people have changed what they eat more in the past 50 years than they did in the 10,000 years before then.  And really everything is focused on Corporate farming and how much it has changed the family farm.  They explore the way animals are butchered, to how they are kept, to even how seeds are grown and the controversy behind seed saving.  As a warning, when the animals are butchered it is directly shown, as is a lot of other hard images regarding animals and how they are processed.  If you have a weak stomach, or sensitive disposition, I'm not sure you could handle this film.<br /><br />There are several interviewees in the film, from farmers that grow their products organically, to those who take place in factory farming, to a woman who lost her child after he ate contaminated meat.  Her story is actually the one that really sticks with you in this movie.  Because nothing really happened after her son died to prevent future things from happening.  But she keeps fighting for government officials to pass ""Kevin's Law"".  A law that will give the USDA the power to shut down factories if they fail safety and health standards too many times.  It should be noted that all the major food corporations were offered to be interviewed and offered rebuttals in this film, and all declined to be interviewed or even to talk to the filmmakers.<br /><br />But the interviews with everyone else are just as informative.  I especially liked the farmer that did things low scale and slaughtered his animals outside, himself, and knew exactly how he was raising his food.  And his cows got to eat grass, so I imagine they were pretty happy cows.  With all the talk about ""pink slime"" lately too its made me want to buy a freezer and just go out and purchase a side of beef and process it myself.  Which really I should, it would make me appreciate the work behind that burger I grill.  The movie actually did get into a little about hamburger meat is made and processed putting a visual to the information out there available in print.<br /><br />There is some political discussion in this documentary.  But nothing specifically pulling out a certain party and putting it under the microscope.  It more goes for certain individuals and where they worked before getting government jobs.  It also explores what effect big corporations and lobbyists have on food laws too.  So if politics is a topic that gets you riled up, I'm not sure if this would be a good fit for a movie for you.  But honestly, I do think people should get riled up about their food.  Its what we survive on and we should be putting the best into our bodies, and we should be making those decisions intelligently.<br /><br />On a separate note the cinematography in this movie is very good.  I liked the effects they had and the way they shot the interviews and showed the footage they had gathered.  It was very professionaly done.  The music on the other hand was less than stellar.  It reminded me of a funeral parlor and while it fit the dreary tone of the whole documentary, I would have preferred there be no music at all.  It just took away from their message because it was too dramatic.<br /><br />Very informative. although it may turn you to vegetarianism for a few days after eating it.  But its information that should be out there and available for people to make their own decisions regarding what happens with their food.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012","Food, Inc"

The movie was not only entertaining, but also very informative and educational.<br /><br />This movie really brings to light the injustices and disservice that the US food industry (Tyson, Monsanto are some of the corporations named in this movie) is doing to our nation and our people. Throughout the movie, you see the fear and threats farmers and ranchers have to deal with from the food industry. You see how much of the food industry is controlled by a few big corporations, and how they have infiltrated our government and agencies such as the FDA. Food companies refuse to label food from cloned animals. The movie even tells of a story about a young kid who died because of E-coli in his hamburger meat. And we all thought that technology is supposed to improve our lives...<br /><br />But there is hope. Ultimately, things are based on economics, and even corporations like Wal-Mart will respond to consumer demand for things like milk from cows not treated with rBST (growth hormone). Every time you purchase something from a grocery store, that's a vote from you telling the grocery store, and the food industry, what kind of food product you want.<br /><br />I know I left a lot out of my review, I just want to say that you should watch this movie. :)","Food, Inc"

It's all founded upon corruption.<br /><br />There must be spiritual and moral ramifications from eating food from this system. I also wonder what it does to our bodies. A week before watching this, I read a news article that American kids are reaching puberty now at hitherto unknown ages: down to age 8. Could it be from all the hormone-laced meats?<br /><br />Many cannot afford the alternatives, but for those who can, buying fresh, cruelty-free, free-range, grass-fed meats and organic fruits/veggies is the way to beat the system.","Food, Inc"

111725,B002LBKDYE, AKMF771XVP1VZ,5.0, EYE OPENER,"I have always been a fan of Alternative Media Sources and smaller movie productions. Mainstream Media and Hollywood offer much needed services for the world; however, it's still refreshing to get the ""Little Guys"" opinion every once in a while, if for no other reason to ensure we gain a COMPLETE picture of our surroundings. First thing is first, THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES. Instead, this movie outlines that while bigger companies grow in size and develop ways to feed LARGE amounts of the population at a RESONABLE price point, that inevitably compromises must be made. Unfortunately, as you watch this movie you are made aware of how drastic these Compromises are, and how they affect the Quality and Nutrition of our food supply. It also adds that every time you choose to buy food that is produced for the `MASSES"", that you are in essence ""casting your vote of approval"". Conversely, if we choose to buy from local farms and natural/organic food processing plants, we will encourage this behavior. If enough of us make this choice, one day the Big Companies will see a chance to make money and will start investing into more appropriate food practices. Another disturbing fact the movie points out is ""the average distance food travels before it gets to our grocery stores"". With the average distance ranging from 1200-1600 miles, that made me wonder what would happen if there were a few ""Temporary"" disruptions in this food chain. For example, bad weather, high gas prices, trucker strikes, terrorist attacks, ect. It just seems to me that if we continue to rely on the Inefficient System that these Big Food processors use to feed us, we are setting ourselves up for failure. I would rather spend MORE MONEY NOW and ensure a healthier existence than spend MORE MONEY LATER for medications and hospitals bills from the poor quality of food that I ate while I was young!","Food, Inc"

In Nebraska,Wisconsin and Iowa we do see large companies hire illegal aliens (exploiting them and bringing crime, poverty and complexity into this society).<br />Moral of the story for me:<br />I'm going to go a little more organic.<br />I'm going to question the way big business handles our food.<br />Thanks for such a great documentary.","Food, Inc"

Everything is bigger, faster, cheaper, and causing unintended consequences.  Because of all the salt, fat and sugar in the fast food industry, America's children are in a Type 2 Diabetes epidemic.  Diabetes is hitting children and younger ages.  The food system is skewed toward obesity.  The treatment of animals in big corporate farms is disgusting.  I applaud Robert Kenner's docuentary that exposes the detrimental effects on our population, environment and health.  I never realized how corn is used in so many products and that cows are herbivores by nature.  We feed them and other animals corn to make them fatter faster.  Genetically developed chickens are top heavy and rased in squalid crowded conditions.  This film will definitely affect the way I eat.  And of course there are people in power with special interests that feel no gain in protecting the average American against e-coli and bad food production.  Food is getting more and more expensive, due to drought, floods, higher oil prices to transport and overpopulation.  There may be no motivation to end this industry rife with monopolies and lax interpretation of laws.  Scary stuff, but strangely fascinating to watch what is really going on.","Food, Inc"

I couldn't let the family see that, so I watched alone, and was pleasantly surprised. Most of the usual blood and guts (not a euphemism) had been edited out, and there are only a few unpleasant segments that are a minute or so long, and are well telegraphed so that you can avert your eyes. It is a shame that the producers could not have taken a leaf from the Pollan documentary <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012680D0"">King Corn (Green Packaging)</a>""King Corn""  which is entertaining, has a whimsical story, and informs as well, all without the blood, etc.<br /><br />I watched this for the information, and it was stunning, as well as informative.

There are some critical tidbits of knowledge here. What moves me the most are the legal ramifications that ignorance has caused our society to witness JUST IN THE LAST DECADE, particularly the story behind Kevin's law (namely the law indicating that powers are given to USDA to shut down a food business that is not following regulations, but the law never passed), and the shocking transition of soybeans to the total ownership by Monsanto via ""intellectual property"" Microsoft-style (93% of all American soybeans as of March 2010 are patented). This stuff is downright scary, and people NEED TO KNOW. If it wasn't happening so fast I'd suggest that they learn it ""one of these days"", but so much of this happened just in the 1990s and 2000s, you need to know this NOW.

111753,B002LBKDYE, A1JYUCYYDLEKXQ,5.0, Disturbing but essential reading. A call to action!!,"This DVD tells a story that is appalling to people concerned with truth in general and with their and others' health. Are the facts in the story true? I believe they are because there are a number of confirming books, videos, and magazine articles that tell similar stories. So, if the story is true, then the situation regarding many foods sold to the public in the United States is appalling. I suspect the situation is the same to at least some degree in other countries so the story concerns all of us. I mean who really has faith in the mass-produced foods imported from China or Brazil? Have you ever seen the videos of Pangasius fish farms in Vietnam or  salmon farms in Norway and the ones the Norwegians have opened in Canada? What is truly scary is the extent to which we suspect the corruption of some of our representatives in Washington and some key officers in the federal agencies meant to protect the public. With the disastrous Supreme Court decision in the Citizens' Union case which opens the floodgates of corporate and self-interested money that can be spent toward political ends, whose influence was confirmed absolutely in the recent Congressional elections, we, the public, are left exposed and unprotected unless we take action ourselves.<br />How can we take action? Stop buying processed foods, farmed fish, non-organically raised meat. Buy organic from trusted sources. It will cost more money but then you know that you need to reduce the volume of food that you eat so do it now and save some or all of that additional cost.<br />No amount of public outrage will persuade a representative to vote against the interests of a corporation that finances his election campaign because our system is such that he has no option to get elected or re-elected. No amount of public outrage will change our overly technical and procedure-heavy legal system that allows a hugely wealthy Monsanto to financially exhaust a farmer whose non-GM fields become polluted by wind-borne patented GM seeds and spores. The only way to cause change is to stop buying these terrible products and by-products and make market forces do the work that we can no longer trust others to do for us. We'll become slimmer and healthier at the same time.","Food, Inc"

I'm not naive - and maybe that's why I did put it off - because I know just enough. But seeing is different than knowing.<br /><br />Super Size Me and King Corn of two of my favorite documentaries. Food Inc both picks up where they left off and becomes the missing piece of the puzzle.I expected to be challenged and horrified by Food Inc, but I didn't expect to be as moved as I was.<br /><br />Some of the statistics and facts presented are staggering. Animals housed and fed to become the end product that are so heavy that their legs can't hold them, diseased animals tossed into the meat mix, A semi-solution that is not taken wherein the cattle being fed a different diet for days could kill 80% of the e coli bacteria. Farmers carrying debt of a half million but making a mere 18K a year. Larger corporations refusing to make statements or appear on camera. Those are almost enough to paint a compelling picture of serious issues.<br /><br />But there's more....the family who eats dollar hamburgers from a fast food outlet based on budget restrictions of both time and money. This same family is shown in the grocery store lamenting the $1.29 per pound price tag on broccoli and when a daughter looks longingly at pears, they are weighed and rejected because $.99 price tag per pound would only buy them two or three pears. However, pop was cheap. The father was diabetic. The mother explained that $260.00 a month went to his two diabetic medications. They had to make a decision between food that might make them all healthier and medicine to keep him healthy.<br /><br />Then there was the political activist who became one when she lost her small child to e coli from tainted burger.<br /><br />I could go on but I won't.<br /><br />If you are concerned about what goes into your mouth, and the mouths of those you care about, you need to look further into America's food supply and Food Inc could be a good starting point.","Food, Inc"
111756,B002LBKDYE, A3NVSRCLHTYKYV,4.0, Why Do We Need To See This Again?  The Reason Is. . .,"One reviewer of low stars asked the question:  why do we need to see this again?  I.e., ""been there, done that""...  Well, the answer is that this kind of message has to be repeated many times before people finally ""get it.""  Hopefully, each time will bring new converts.  I didn't give this movie 5 stars because there are areas of deficiency in the film.  But this is a story that's difficult to tell, both emotionally and logistically, and the makers deserve high praise for their efforts.  Yes, it can be simplistic at times.  But it needs to be simple in order to get through to everyone.  Simple is not necessarily inaccurate.<br /><br />Many citizens are in denial because it's easier and less painful than the truth.  Most of the 1 star reviews here seem like ""plants"" of the food industry and its associates.  I believe that most of my fellow humans care far more about themselves, other humans, and the planet.<br /><br />Personally, I've been on the bandwagon for years, and learned nothing new from the movie, but I still hesitate to bring up this controversy with friends because people are so touchy about it.  Prime demon here may be the Monsanto Mafia.  They have bullied and elbowed their way into a position of almost exclusive control of many critical aspects of farming, and their ""thug"" tactics are despicable.  Their ability to hold a position of power relies on enormous wealth and their expensive, soul-selling lawyers.  The movie points out how aspects of our government have been so thoroughly compromised by these interests that they are effectively gutted.  Their ability to possibly determine the fate of the planet by totally controlling the seed stock is horrifying.

The pigs are killed in one factory at the rate of 2,000 per HOUR--dumped ALIVE into a big bin on top of each other into a bin below, as though they are garbage.  What doesn't kill them in the dump, kills them when a big metal CRUSHER COMES DOWN AND CRUSHES THEM ALL INTO A DEAD MASS (like they demo. automobiles).

It may be true that Food, Inc is a bit one-sided, but some of the points it raises are to be considered seriously. One point that was raised is the fact that $1 menu places are more affordable than healthier food in a store; a direct contributor to the growing epidemic of childhood obesity. A lot of the argument may remain dormant unless parents can get their kids away from the video games and insist they get some exercise. Lots of other points are raised, and should be considered.

111785,B002LBKDYE, A2W2ODLRQ2L8LE,4.0, Food for Thought,"America has a population of well over 300 million persons living in it. If these 300 million persons each have 3 meals per day, that is a total of 900 million meals a day. This is a tremendous amount of food that has to be produced on a daily basis. What this film reveals is the dichotomy between the mass food producers and the small producers.<br /><br />The small producers are seen as the ethical heroes who want things to be done in the clean old fashion way. On the other hand the massive food producers are seen as ruthless unethical businessmen. Graphic images of cows up to their knees in their own filth, and illegal immigrant workers with fingernail infections are seen. But the reality is that the small producers can never meet, or even come close to the vast daily demands for food.<br /><br />There is an obvious problem here, if it is not addressed soon there can be some sort of food borne illness that can quickly spread, killing untold numbers in its path. After watching the movie (because you won't be sure what parts of it are staged) you ask yourself, what can we do about this? Most of us will quietly say nothing and after 15 minutes go on to the next movie. So, the problem remains and is probably getting worse on a daily basis as the population increases.","Food, Inc"

Seeing this movie will open your eyes.  This movie is not trying to make Americans abandon meat and switch to vegetarianism as the DVD cover might suggest, but rather it  makes you question what you are eating and the way its produced.  I intend to only purchase meats that are produced the way nature intended, i.e. free range chickens and grass fed beef, as opposed to corn feed and factory processed.

I am a pretty conservative businessperson, and tend to view the anti-establishment ""business is bad"" crowd with some measure of skepticism.  Unfortunately, after watching this documentary, and the brilliant use of both facts and parallels to the tabacco industry of the 1960's and 1970's, I have to say that I am absolutely disgusted and disappointed.  Not in the Cargills and Monsantos.  I am just cynical enough to expect that behavior. Business tends to be ethically neutral at best.  I am most disappoined and disgusted at our lawmakers and government agencies that are tasked to counterbalance this ethically agnostic behavior with a genuine protective and benevolent interest for the public they were hired or elected to protect and serve. If government is truly abdicating its role as the protector of the citizens of this country, and allows monopolies like the Monsanto soybean seed monopoly to perpetuate, we are better off not paing the taxes to support this continuing behavior.<br /><br />After watching, I am both saddened by the state of the food we eat and the condition of the institutions responsible for our safety.  This is a must watch, eye opening account that will educate you on the seedy underbelly (no puns intended) of the food production industry today.  A sad state.","Food, Inc"
111792,B002LBKDYE, ADNB4EWB0J90P,5.0," FOOD, INC.","Excellent movie that should open up the consumers' eyes. My personal experiences at stock barns, farms, food factories, grocery stores, restaurants, etc., was realistic and many times a horror, but this movie shows us what our country has come to and what the average consumer isn't aware of, is complacent to, or just plain apathetic about.<br /><br />It shows us who's running the country in regard to what we are dependent on... FOOD. It should kick the mentality of intelligent people into not buying into the propaganda we are fed, and becoming less dependent on the buying that we now experience. Peoples' lives are apparently not as precious as the almighty dollar. Our government is also slacking off by letting this go on by not putting more people with integrity into the jobs associated with our food consumption system. Animals as well as humans are being degraded and treated less than inhumane. Putting thought back into how we live now as compared to 50 years ago, may rattle some cages and the truth may get them to show some real patriotism and caring about others in this country.<br /><br />I think that watching this movie would be educating as well as motivating to any human being who watches it! Diseases and health issues are rampant and this movie gives us a glimpse into that. What I really admire, is that this isn't a PETA documentary, but written by an omnivore just like me.<br /><br />I thank Bill and Louise Daniels of WellSpring Lifestyle Retreat in Goodspring, TN for recommending this movie to me.<br /><br />Carpe diem, ya'll!

We are not educated about where our food comes, what is in our food and what is being done to our food.  In fact, Europeans know more about our food than we do.  Before I saw this movie, I honestly thought I was a healthy eater.  My motto was shop from the outside aisles in the grocery stores.  I had no idea that I was being 'corn fed' by eating what I thought was healthier choices.  My mind was blown away when I learned of all the products that contain corn; ketchup, mustard, mayo, fish and more.  The products that contain corn (and a ton of chemicals) are endless.  After watching the movie, I was so fired up that I was just learning where my food came from in my 30's I decided to write a health blog, I have given health talks to women and I have hosted several weight loss competitions.  Since I have seen the movie (and tried to stay away from corn-based products) I have lost 14 pounds (which is a lot for me) and I have seen others lose as well. I highly recommend this movie.

Conditions need to get better not only because the current method of production is inhumane, but also we need more more wholesome and safer food.<br /><br />However, grass-fed ribeye steak is currently $19.99 - $27.99 per pound.  How can I afford that?<br /><br />So there's a balance between mass production food and price.  Nevertheless, I'll be eating organic grass-fed beef, and if I can only afford grass-fed ground beef, so be it.  But we need to vote for healthier and more humane food through our purchases.<br /><br />By the way, most people only think of ""organic"".  There's a few more things that we need to think about as consumers of food:<br /><br />1.  Organic (this only means that non-organic pesticides and fertilizers are **reduced**)<br />2.  Locally grown<br />3.  Non-GMO<br />4.  Non-irradiated<br />5.  Grass or pasture fed, if meat<br />6.

111814,B002LBKDYE, A19SPM4Y7A8OHN,5.0, Finally...had to watch because of a friend,"When I saw, ""from the makers of the Inconvenient Truth"", on the case, I thought, ""I'll never watch that"". Global warming (the man-made kind) is complete BS in my mind, and unless we resume testing atmospheric testing of h-bombs, I am very unlikely to change.<br /><br />I say that only to illustrate the apparent inconsistency in giving this documentary 5 stars.<br /><br />Film-wise, the film is very well done. The real-life characters were well chosen and seemed to be good down-to-earth Midwestern folks. That lent a lot of credibility IMO. Politically (a reason I do not watch similarly themed documentaries) I thought it more balanced than most. True, Bush 43's mug was mentioned as well as some in his administration, but Clinton was mentioned too.<br /><br />It wasn't all-corporations-are-evil, all-the-time either. I liked the balance of one farmer who supposedly does it ""the right way"". Here, we could see the slaughtering of chickens, and to some this may appear as bad as the mass-production style of killing, but leaving the distinction up to the viewer was a good choice. I also liked the organic company who does business with Walmart. The CEO's sense of win-win, that is, making a profit while still adhering to the mission of no pesticides, fertilizer, etc., was a good choice too for the film.<br /><br />The food system is so out-of-sight and out-of-mind in our lives that only the staunch nutritionists I know realize any of the things mentioned in the film. Consequently, I believe most of it is definitely true. One can certainly argue that it is impossible to feed 6 billion people without assembly-line techniques being employed. That is process-oriented change stuff though. When they start altering natural evolution at my expense, that is where I walk over to the ""enough already"" side.<br /><br />The one thing this documentary does for me is confirm a belief I already hold: The United States government is nothing but a huge multi-trillion dollar whorehouse. Corporations pay the pimps (Lobbyists) who buy the whores (Congressmen, Senators, and the White House) who in turn forces their slaves (The American People) to bend over and take it.<br /><br />This film achieved its objective I think as I will not be able to look at another food product again without reading the label and *this time*, researching what those unpronounceable ingredients are and how they affect my body. I see much more kale in my future now.","Food, Inc"

Everyone should see the movie if they don't want to read the book because it shows vividly how we get our food, and much of it is something nobody could actually want.  It also shows better, healthier alternative ways of farming and raising animals for food.

We have decided to eat for quality instead of quantity.  We do not have a lot of money but we choose to eat food that was raised or grown with care.  Sometimes this means passing up some of those great sales on chicken and tons of other products...Oh...and since watching this DVD we have vowed never to purchase another Tyson product again.  They do not deserve our money....they are pumping their chickens full of crap then wrapping them in nice packages for us to serve our children....no way....we are done with them.

When we buy an item at the supermarket it feeds them.  It is their life-blood.  If we know about them, their business practices, and what products they sell, then we can send them a message with the power of our dollar.

I love all sections of the piece. Definitely it educates the consumer about how what they eat is produced. The good as well as the not so good sides of it. I used this DVD in my class to generate a discussion about the highly commercialized agriculture vs less commercialized agriculture. We all know that it's a challenge for a farmer or an agricultural operation to produce a product economically and efficiently with low cost and deliver it in the marker for a profit. This DVD deals with producing something faster, cheaper, in bulk and deliver it to the consumer oftentimes compromising environmental sustainability and consumer health. On the other hand, it also gives a great picture about how some other small scale agricultural businesses are done taking care of aforementioned problems. It also speaks well to the food safety related issue that is very important in the current time as we see a lot more plant and animal related products are being recalled than it used to be. It also has a good account on organic agriculture and how large companies grow through mergers and acquisitions. Overall, this is a job well done.","Food, Inc"

111834,B002LBKDYE, A1YFDAJWCH2ISV,5.0, A eye opener,"This is a must watch for everyone in America who eats meat. It's really a disgust to see the other side of our food supply controlled by I'm sure a few LARGE businesses. My wife and I now buy very little meat from Wal-Mart and the grocery Store. We bought a deep freezer and got on the internet and to out surprise there was several people in a thirty mile radius of us in the same movement we wanted to head and we found local beef, pork and chickens we now purchase. We have shopped around some and already found prices comparable to Wal-Mart prices too. We found a lady who sells eggs for a dollar a dozen all we want. We just bought three quarters of a cow at four dollars a pound of edible meat and when you average ground beef all the way up to sirloins and t-bones I'd say that was a pretty good bargain.<br /><br />Use common sense and research around starting with this movie. Then use common sense and tell yourself your body can't take all these antibiotics and hormones they pump full in your food supply just to get it raised faster and bigger all for one purpose to them - to make more money. Don't take my word for it and maybe this movie won't even convince you but please don't just call it a conspiracy theory and blow it off like I've already had family members and friends do to me.

111849,B002LBKDYE, A2KDGS8YBLG31N,4.0, Food Inc. Review,"A good movie that looks at the impact of how our food is grown and processed. It is difficult to watch and afterward I was left feeling like I didn't want to eat, or least not purchase meat from a grocery store ever again.

111850,B002LBKDYE, A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ,5.0, Good But Disturbing,"So, rather than repeat everything that has already been said, I just want to express my opinion. First, after watching this, I'm glad I don't like beef because I definitely wouldn't after this. The food industry is another example of corrupt big business takeovers, which is pretty much in every industry. Actually, it's kind of frightening that, not only can someone patent a seed, if that plant's seed spreads into your land through natural means (you know, like the way seeds spread for millions of years before humans started playing around with them), you can still get into trouble and the burden of proof seems to be on you as the accused...so much for the constitution but we know how much that means in this day and age anyway (i.e. the Patriot Act amongst others, go ahead and check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IX4CC0"">The End of America: Director's Cut</a>, that's another disturbing one).<br /><br />After watching this, I almost want to just start hunting and growing my own food except that a big corporation may come in and accuse me of patent theft somehow and force me to hire some high priced lawyer to prove my innocence. All that said, this is a real eye opener and I think everyone in America should watch it.","Food, Inc"

We thought that it was bad food just because of the way they are raised/grown.  Not so.  Our food industry is really bad because of the way they are treated - physically.<br />Not only is the food being produced *bad* but it is also a money-making frenzy.  The government is not interested in our health, they're just out to get a buck.<br /><br />I hope many people will see this and take action - don't just agree with how bad things are going, TAKE ACTION.

It lays out the facts and doesn't seem like some kind of weird conspiracy theory.<br />Some people have suggested in their reviews that this film has a leftist slant - I personally didn't find this to be the case.  I would think that regardless of a person's political affiliations, they would be interested in knowing about the origins of what they put in their body.

111863,B002LBKDYE, A16P5N8MNTXXU3,5.0," The costs of ""abundant cheap food"" to our health and humanity","This award-winning documentary along with the documentary ""King Corn"" had a profound effect on me and has permanently changed my lifestyle and diet. I am not a counter-culture, idealistic college student--I am a retired college professor who was in the health professions my entire career. What has happened to our food supply as a result of providing ""abundant cheap food"" in the U.S. since 1973 is eyeopening and a wake-up call to each of us regarding what we eat and support through our food dollars as individuals and as a nation. ""Our bodies are not just what we eat but what we eat, eats"". The control of U.S. agriculture by a very few large agribusiness companies; limiting the number of crops grown and varieties; the modification of seeds and trademarking life forms has implications that could prove diasterous not only to us but the entire world's food supply.<br /><br />Organic foods and sustainable farming offers people an option to purchase and eat foods which are not loaded with pesticide and herbicide residues; to eat and drink dairy products, eggs and meat animals that are not loaded with growth hormones to spur production and to put weight on quickly to maximize profits of the huge companies; to decrease the potential of causing ""superbugs"" resistant to antibiotics caused by the administration of continuous antibiotics to keep food animals alive under unnatural and horrific conditions being fed #2 field corn (which they would never eat if allowed a normal life before slaughter for food.) Cattle evolved to eat grass, not grain and the effects on the animal are known but ignored--our beef today contains only 60% of the protein it contained in the mid 1950s thanks to meat packers wanting the highly marbled (read fat)beef. Fish farmers are even trying to get salmon and tilapia to accept #2 field corn feed. The high fructose corn syrup and other products from #2 field corn are in almost all of our grocery products on the market--even those items we do not think of as being sweet. I no longer wonder why people have such a hard time losing weight when most of us eat a diet loaded with hormones given to animals to put on weight quickly and high fructose corn syrup in almost everything we eat.<br /><br />The U.S. government does not allow genetically-modified food to be labelled; as a result a number of European countries will no longer import certain foods from the U.S. since they require the labelling of genetic modification to grains, fruits and vegetables.  No one (no one) knows the long term effects of using bacteria and viruses to introduce foreign genes from other species into food we eat.<br /><br />The health risks and costs of ""abundant cheap food""---what it has done to small family farms that did not go along with big agribusiness practices; the requirement of more and more pesticides which may be partially responsible for the abandonment of hives and death of thousands of our pollinators esp. the honey bee. Principles of organic farming which enriches the soil, is better for the farmer, farm animals and us is more expensive than what most of us have been eating everyday.  As a consumer and someone concerned about the implications of standard, modern agricultural practices, I am willing to pay more for the farmer to farm organically--I support fair-trade and believe the farmer and his family need to be to support themselves and their way of life.<br /><br />As a result of the documentaries my diet is now as much organic as possible; I no longer eat beef, pork, chickens, dairy or eggs produced by the big food processors. I now read labels on the food products I buy to make sure I am not ingesting sweeteners made from #2 field corn. I try to buy wild, Alaskan salmon rather than farmed or Atlantic salmon. I believe my diet is now more nutritious and tastier than ever before.  My granddaughter has her master's degree in nutrition and she and her parents have also made changes in their diet from the belief that they will be healthier.<br /><br />I recommend this documentary and ""King Corn"" to anyone interested in their health and nutrition.","Food, Inc"

111869,B002LBKDYE, A3BM7XARTMHOR1,5.0, A must see for everyone - adults and teens,"This isn't a movie all about animals and vegetarianism, which I think a lot of people think it is about. It is about the nations food supply, the politics behind it, and what the industry doesn't want the consumer to know. I believe we should know what we are putting into our bodies, and how that food got to our plate, grocery store, etc. Once people are educated on the different companies and practices, they can vote with their dollar by buying and supporting companies they believe in. I think this movie should be mandatory for everyone to see, and played in junior high and high schools across the country.

111870,B002LBKDYE, A2FFMW5UH8WNL5,5.0, Changing things up in my house,"So, after this movie was recommended to me buy multiple family members, I finally decided to give it a shot.  Even though I had an idea about the food industry, I had no idea what the big picture actually was.  I was so disturbed on so many levels that I will no longer purchase certain brands of products.  I was also pretty upset about how some of these workers are being treated.  My favorite part was the small sustainable farmer in Virgina.  He was so right, if we were willing to pay a little more for the food that we put in our bodies, we could go to that type of farming for most of the country.  I felt so bad for the mom who lost her 2 year old son.  As a mother of an almost two year old, it makes me think twice about what I may buy at the grocery store or what I give her when we eat out.  It is amazing to think that we may complain about the cost of meat (especially boneless chicken breasts) yet stock up on cans of soda which are 4 for $10.  Overall, this was a very eye opening movie that I think everyone should see.  It wasn't enough to make me go vegetarian, but enough to change the way I purchase food. There are multiple sites out there that allow you to search for sustainable farms in your area, I encourage you to check it out...as well as your local farmers market if you can find one!","Food, Inc"
111871,B002LBKDYE, AC0971W2C89A0,4.0, Informative - Please See,"This is the first time I'm reviewing a product - ever. I had resisted watching this documentary for a long time as I thought it would be biased, in-your-face and gruesome. In fact, it was well organized, balanced and insightful. After watching this, I realize that I can make some small adjustments in my own life. Not only to be socially responsible, but also, for my own health.<br /><br />I will not get into how sad or heartbreaking it is to see the animals suffer. Hopefully, we can all agree that at some level, suffering solely for the sake of greater profits in just not humane.<br /><br />However, on a practical or even selfish level, it is not in anyone's interest to see our food source be controlled by a handful of corporations. If profit is the main goal, and power is concentrated in the hands of so few (corporate big heads who don't see or live with the consequences of their decisions), then you end up with policies like cleaning your food products with ammonia or ecoli in your ground meat. The fact that a family of 4 can more easily fill up at their local fast food joint (under $12) rather than buy vegetables at their local supermarket or that local farmers are so dependent (and indebted) on their corporate customers indicate there are deep rooted issues with long-lasting consequences.<br /><br />However, as the film makes clear, consumers do have a voice by choosing to buy certain items (i.e. organic, locally produced, free range chickens, grass fed cows etc.) because this translates into profit and profit talks. I would recommend this film to everyone.","Food, Inc"
111872,B002LBKDYE, A3E8ZPULRBVDMN,5.0, a must-see for every American,"This video was so thought provoking.  So few of us have a good idea where our food comes from or how it was produced.  Most of our nutrition education is limited to TV commercials selling us ""healthy"" fast food or ""natural"" factory-farmed fat-filled meat products.  And then we wonder why America is the fattest country in the world.  It's true that about 1 in 3 American kids born today will end up with Diabetes Type 2 at some point.  DM Type 2 isn't just something annoying that prevents you from eating cookies: it's a terrible disease, a top cause of blindness & amputations, and a very high risk for cardiovascular/HTN problems.  Just like the family in the video illustrated DM Type 2 is very costly to control.  Their medications were ""hundreds"" of dollars a month.  Yet they continue to eat fast-food at most meals.  What they don't understand is that $200-$300 a month goes a long way into buying healthy food choices.  Food can be prepared in advance, then frozen, so time is no excuse.  People just aren't educated on what not to eat.  And when the only ads we see are from big agri-business, no wonder we're confused?<br /><br />I am deeply troubled by the increasing food industry power.  They've already taken away 1st Amendment rights: it's now illegal to openly discuss food production/industry topics (even if they're TRUE), if the discussion hurts the corporation's sales figures.  How is this even constitutional?  This is the same government who has cut USDA inspections down to a fraction of what they were decades ago, even though population and food intake only goes up.<br /><br />I also am troubled that in light of the role of lifestyle in health, that nobody is talking about diet during our current healthcare debates.  Why didn't part of the new Health Care bill touch on things brought up in this movie?  And why are my tax dollars being used to provide feed corn to feedlots at below market cost?  Corn has been so cheap that people are even burning it to heat their homes (corn stoves).  How about we stop wasting tax money on corn and if we want to subsidize something that counts, we use it only for healthy food choices such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, foods free of HFCS, non-factory-farmed animal products, etc.<br /><br />The movie is interesting.  I think if you buy it for your whole family to watch, you won't get bored.  It is thought provoking.  I first watched it on Netflix and it was so good, I ordered a copy from Amazon to share with my friends.  People need to know this stuff.  It's true: you are what you eat.","Food, Inc"

Concerned that we had no idea what was going on, or how we were participating unknowingly!  The next time I went to the grocery store, I was paralyzed with fear of the unknown! I kept thinking, ""how am I going to find healthy food to serve my family now? Holy Cow!""<br /><br />This movie is very through, and doesn't use harsh tactics to get your attention. The subject matter is enough to do that. What it does is show just a good glimpse of what happening in the food production world that has taken over farming as we thought we knew it. American farmers have been taken over by profit hungry corporations. Most humane animal treatment has gone out the window, along with food as God intended it. We are now eating food that has been genetically, antibiotically, and hormonally altered to turn up the profits! I felt really ashamed for not knowing intuitively that something is wrong! America is the fattest nation on earth,so is there a chance that altered food is contributing to it? Things like High Fructose Corn Syrup? Corn fed cows? Really? Please don't take my word for it, just get this movie, and watch it for yourselves. It is definitely a ""MUST SEE TO BELIEVE"" experience. Watch with someone who's health you care about! And for your futures sake, read the labels on everything you buy!","Food, Inc"

111900,B002LBKDYE, A1KGRAJLK2GHU1,5.0, Must See DVD - your stomach will thank you,"It's a challenge to present a difficult subject matter, one infused with so much political fire, in a respectful and straightforward way. Food Inc. does the job perfectly. It isn't preachy, it isn't blasting viewers with gory sights from slaughterhouses, it isn't one-sided; what it does is share important information in a way that lets viewers see behind the scenes of big agriculture, behind the marketing and the hype.<br /><br />Often, books and movies on this subject are preaching to the choir. The only folks that see or read the message didn't need the message in the first place. Food Inc. is mainstream, accessible and open to everyone. Food, our health and our land shouldn't be an issue for the Left or the Right. It impacts all of us equally and the solution has to involve all sides. Small farmers have a big stake in this, as do those concerned with the environment, food safety advocates, workers' rights defenders and average consumers. Everybody has a piece of this pie and how we choose to go forward is what will matter. Food Inc. gives the viewer plenty of food for thought but also some conclusions that can be implemented now by consumers to help bring big business in line with what is safe and healthy.<br /><br />Skeptics especially should watch this film. If you don't believe there is anything wrong with genetically modified food, with huge agricultural factories, with our current food safety, then watch this film and put your thoughts and beliefs up against the information presented. If nothing else, I think skeptics will get the chance to see things from another view point and perhaps walking a mile in those boots will give them some food for thought too.","Food, Inc"

What they do with Chicken and ham..i wonder by the other companies.<br /><br />This is not a lets see if we can shock the audience.

Producers of our food count on the American people to remain ignorant due to lack of interest, laziness or simply choosing to turn a blind eye to this subject. Their time is limited though because people are getting tired of watching people they love die of disease and are beginning to search for answers. This movie has many of the answers contained within the information provided. It is the raw truth. It is hard to watch at times. It is even harder to comprehend that food producers, politicians, and our government whom we believe are taking care of our best interest are not doing so but instead serving their own interest - mainly for profit at the expense of health, our lives and the welfare of our country. Every person needs to watch this film - you will never be able to look at food in a grocery store quite the same way again and you will always make conscious decisions on what you choose to eat and spend your money on.

Had a bad reaction to anesthesia and/or pain meds, so I didn't eat for 5 days. The 2nd day home I watched this movie, it made such an impact, I've eaten meat only once since and have dropped another 45 lbs. I FEEL GREAT! I offer this movie to anyone that will watch it, so far all have come away with changed diets, if not lives. The movie doesn't try to convince you to eat a particular way, it just presents the information in such a way that you are at your own will to come to your own conclusion. For me I equate eating commercially processed meat to having to survive on bugs, grubs, and roaches. I've completely sworn off hamburger meat and chicken, unless it's free range. Now it's a game my wife and I play in the grocery store spotting the corn by products in almost all processed foods. It's actually harder finding the ones that don't have any. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone and especially those with health and weight problems.","Food, Inc"
111906,B002LBKDYE, A1XGHRXYQ2V29,4.0, People should watch this . . . but take it with a grain of salt.,"I enjoyed this film, although ""enjoyed"" seems wrong when I was on the point of horror for much of it. The film is well-made and persuasive (which is why I give it four stars), although a bit one-sided (which is why I didn't give it five stars). It was very informative, though, and by the end, I was all ready to jump on their bandwagon. But, I like to research the opposing views before making my decisions, so I went to the one-star reviews - and they actually make some good points. While I agree with much of this film's arguments, I think it serves best as a starting point for discussion. So I recommend the film - I think it's right for people to learn more about where their food comes from - but I caution against accepting everything the filmmakers say without looking at opposing views first. (This is a good stand to take on any issue, of course.)","Food, Inc"
111907,B002LBKDYE, APMKMM6284FH4,4.0," Remember kids...if it ain't a GMO, it ain't goood eatin'!","Here are two facts about myself I'm going to share with you to put this in perspective. Fact the first...I am a fan of food. I don't just like to eat per se but I like to experience and try new foods. I am a foodie if you will, but I am in no way a food snob. This is the obvious fact as evidenced by my ever expanding waistline. The other fact is that while I enjoy documentaries, I try not to watch ones that have a political undertone since I get all fired up about them. I don't really watch the news for that same reason. Politics are bad for my mental health. So it was with some slight trepidation that I watched ""Food, Inc.""<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that you should never trust a documentarian. They usually seem to have an agenda and it often times seeps into the film itself. So with that in mind, ""Food, Inc."" is a film about the way we eat. Or more correctly, the way our food is produced and packaged and brought to the consumer. It is a fascinating subject because it is something that effects every person in the country but it is a topic that most of us never stop to consider. The film touches on many aspects of the food industry: the industrialization of farming and the changes to reality that it has brought to our farming communities, both physically and economically; the virus like spread of corn into all of the products we eat which is often not immediately apparent to consumers; and the genetic tampering and short-cuts the food industry has taken to give the consumer what it wants at the cost of nutrition and, as a consequence, our health. These points are presented well and are thought provoking.<br /><br />But the real revelation of the film, at least for me, was the depiction of the food industry as a shadowy and powerful cabal in the US government. According to the film, they have positioned themselves into power by exempting themselves from trust laws, keeping their operations a strictly guarded secret, and paying low wages to employees who work in dangerous and filthy environments. All of this leads to risks to the health of the public at large. What is truly shocking, if true, is how the food industry has effectively made the USDA and FDA powerless to regulate and enforce sanctions on them. Realizing that they have made organizations that are meant to protect us toothless in the pursuit of capitalism is, well, part of what gets me all fired up and why I try to avoid these things.<br /><br />The above is contrasted by images of the local farmer, the organic grower, companies that care about the well being of the public and the environment. So the message is to eat local, eat organic, eat seasonal, stop The Man. (By the way, this is spelled out explicitly in an interminable ""you-should-do-this"" sequence at the end.) And that is my main problem with the film. I understand they are trying to get a message across. But they only pay lip service to the negatives, if at all. For one, the film does touch on the expense of eating organic and local yet it is a short segment and incomplete at that. The fact of the matter is that it is significantly more expensive to buy organic and local products. Many families simply can't afford to do this. The film seems to suggest that this is also the doing of the food industry. While the industry does play a part, the flip side is not significantly explored. Also, zero mention is made (from what I recall) of what organic produce does to the population of the world at large. I have heard jokes told that for every ""progressive"" yuppie enjoying their organic apple, 100 people are dying of starvation in the third world. The simple fact is...if all we produced was local and organic, we couldn't support the worlds population. Who knows if we could even support our own. While it is all well and good to say it is better for your health, I'm sure those starving appreciate your moral stance against a genetically modified kumquat.<br /><br />""Food, Inc."" is a good film and I encourage you to see it. Listen to what it has to say but don't go off the deep end and keep it in perspective. Oh yeah, and in case you were wondering, there isn't much in the way of gruesome animal slaughtering. The most graphic things involves chickens (at a small farm no less.) Bon app&eacute;tit!","Food, Inc"

Even back then, there was concerns by the local farmers of the impact of the corporate farm on the food industry. I doubt any of them, however, would have imagined to what extent our Federal Governments would have facilitated the deterioration of public health and food safety in their support of corporate food production, over that of the family farm operation.<br /><br />On a brighter note, I very much appreciated that there remains a glimmer of hope that we, as consumers, and in cooperation with the dedication and courage of individual farmers who are willing to speak up and return to traditional farming methods and values, have the power to right what has become an unimaginable wrong within North American society.<br /><br />I found Food, Inc., to have offered a fair representation of food production in North America, and I urge every consumer to see this film.","Food, Inc"

So much isn't what it seems. The movie is highly recommended for anyone who cares about what they eat or the health of the planet or how corporations are eroding the quality of our lives. It's all in the name of profit margin and pleasing stockholders or CEOs. What we need is a whole lot more ""Undercover Boss.""","Food, Inc"

The economic system is poisoning us gradually unhindered for the most part by government auditing and regulating. No wonder our children in each future generation seem to be plagued by more and more ailments and diseases. If truth were to be told about the chemicals being put into our processed foods; acutally all foods, even those grown on corporate farms, since chemicals are used in animal food and on foods grown in the fields...it is safe to say we would be hard pressed as to what to eat at all.

I enjoy the occasional burger, and steak so rare that it moos when I take a bite.  While the documentary hasn't totally changed my perspective on eating meat, it has definitely changed my perspective on where that meat comes from.<br /><br />And not only beef, but poulty, and any of the hundreds of foods we consume made from corn.  It goes without saying that the documentary makers have an obvious bias against many major food corporations, but some evidence speaks for itself.<br /><br />I first watched Food, Inc through Netflix, but bought several copies from Amazon to send to my relatives.  I love them, and want them to stick around, so I'd like them to at least have a better understanding of what they put into their bodies.  They don't have to change what they eat; just rethink where they might get it from.<br /><br />This is an eye-opening documentary that offers a very interesting perspective on major food corporations.  A little biased at times, but there's no way to spin some of the startling facts that you're presented with.","Food, Inc"

111940,B002LBKDYE, A1KBYAIYX72US0,5.0, Wow,"When my dad asked me to order this DVD for him, I didn't know what to expect.  When I ordered the DVD, I was allowed to watch it instantly online as well, so I did, and wow! What can I say?  I've known for a long time that there were problems with the way food is produced in this country--the increasingly frequent outbreaks of e. coli and salmonella are indication enough of that--but this documentary revealed things that were surprising even to me.  Yet, even as the documentary shows you the good, the bad, and the ugly of our food industry, they manage to do so in a way that doesn't come off as preachy or condescending.  You journey through several different farms, from huge, stifling factory farms to an ""old-fashioned"" farm where cattle still eat grass and the chickens still see sunlight.  You meet farmers that have been put impossibly deep in debt by the demands of the industry that contracted them, honest people that were prosecuted and denied their livelihood when they committed no crime, and a mother who lost her son to tainted meat and continues to fight for stronger regulation of the industry.  You're shown the facts about where our food comes from, how it's made, and how it reaches us, and at the end there is a very simple message--by shopping smarter and choosing food that has been produced humanely and sustainably, we have the power to change the food industry for the better.<br /><br />I highly recommend this documentary.","Food, Inc"
111941,B002LBKDYE, A2B40GY83NI7NX,4.0, View this movie with a grain of salt....and pepper.,"This movie seems to be biased against the big food industry, the ones that provided that triple bypass with cheese for 99 cents you just had for lunch. It does however provide an intriguing look into the mass food/fast food industry and how consumers are being manipulated. It shows a lowly soybean farmer being harrased by a big corporation, and without giving us all the facts, tries to create sympathy for the poor fellow when in fact he was probably involved in illegal activity. This movie also exposes the ugliness of the mass slaughtering of animals and is rather disturbing.<br />In my opinion this movie doesn't address the obvious - over population! Without the mass food industry the world would be starving.","Food, Inc"

This video seems to be a balanced expose of corporate meat processing practices and the risks consumers face when they are ""out of the loop"" as to how our food(s) reach the table. Knowing your sources of supply contributes to our overall health.","Food, Inc"
111944,B002LBKDYE, A1L7IMLGPF72GG,5.0," It's More About ""Who"" Than ""What""","I was a little surprised that this film didn't focus more on the actual conditions of our factory farms; but then I imagine it's getting ever more difficult for outsiders to get inside these facilities.  What did surprise me was the degree of ruthlessness exhibited by one company in particular - Monsanto.  I realize that companies in general play ""hard-ball"" when it comes to their business practices; but this company has taken that concept to a new high in attempting to corner the soybean market - which it already has about 95% of anyway! It summarily sues any farmer who hasn't bought its genetically altered seeds if any trace of those seeds show up anywhere in that farmer's crop. And, given the nature of the crop pollination process, it's virtually impossible for some of those seeds not to show up in just about every farmer's crop.  Monsanto simply sends its army of lawyers out to shut the independent farmer down - something which, needless to say, the farmer cannot return since, even if some of his seeds show up in the genetically altered crops, he cannot afford such a legal juggernaut.  Another interesting aside concerns one of our Supreme Court Justices, who had once been a Monsanto attorney - and who, instead of recusing himself when a case concerning Monsanto came before the Court, actually wrote the majority opinion!  All in all, this film is as much about business practices as it is about food itself.","Food, Inc"

I quickly stopped letting my child eat certain foods after seeing what the mother on this film went through. It helped me make better decisions about food quality and I plan to watch it every now and then to remind me of why I don't eat certain food anymore. I would have given it 5 stars if it were a little faster in its delivery and they probably could've gotten a lot more intense footage if they let people and locations remain confidential. That way we might have been able to go inside chicken houses, etc and people not get let out of their contracts as a result. Overall, great film!","Food, Inc"

Overall, it's definitely changed how I view food -- what I eat and chose to buy.

111950,B002LBKDYE, AQTFIS2KV2RCB,5.0, Eye Opening,"It's amazing how much the food industry has changed just in the past 40-50 years.  I knew that farms were factory-like, but I really didn't know that it had gone to the extent that it has.<br /><br />I wish everyone could see this video so they would know what is being done to make food cheapest and fattest, and what is put into the food that they eat.  I think if the public was more aware of processes and origins of their food, they could make better choices, and vote with their money to buy less factory-like made food until some of these processes and procedures were no longer profitable.<br /><br />As I watched these factories where animals spend their entire lives packed in so tight to each other that they can hardly move and they hang out all day in their own urine and feces, where it's impossible to clean the waste out due to the packed conditions .... I wondered how in the heck could any of these animals be truly 'healthy', and how does it benefit people to eat an unhealthy animal?  A lot of the animals we eat are sick!  How can that be good???<br /><br />I was also astonished at the lack of control that some farmers have over their own farms, and at how corn works in America.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this DVD to everyone.","Food, Inc"

I have loaned it out to everyone I care about, because to be ignorant is dangerous. I've had an allergy to beef for the last 15 years and never knew why.  I am buying grass fed beef now and have yet to have any reaction, which tells me its not beef but maybe the hormones or antibiotics or the ammonia they wash the beef in or maybe the dye they use to make it look red.

111974,B002LBKDYE, A1BSZ4000U2UCK,5.0, a balanced presentation,"I thought that, considering the food companies themselves were unwilling to be open to scrutiny in this documentary, and present more of their side of the picture, the film managed to be remarkably balanced and objective.  Naturally, it behooves us all to be somewhat aware of the ""factory system"" that is involved with the food that sustains us.  I guess what I find so remarkable is that the system works so well, not that it has failings, considering the level that the U.S. has become dependent on just a few large companies.  On the other hand, the tragedies were also included and put into perspective.  That the system is so large and inflexible that it cannot be corrected when humans or animals are being abused is discouraging.  In getting some feel for the enormity of the food industry, I guess the ultimate question that lurks at the boundaries of this film is whether or not we are getting close to (or perhaps have exceeded) what the ecologists like to call ""carrying capacity"" for population.","Food, Inc"

I applaud the filmmakers and participants who have told this much needed story. I am upset and disappointed at how these companies, the government, and consumers have allowed creation of scientifically generated foods to land on our tables. We all, at some point, have contributed to this horrible production of food. I believe consumers have had the least involvement in this madness but hold the most power for change, as the film indicates.<br /><br />The two stories that stood out for me were the mother/daughter team who lost a son/grandson due to E-coli, and the owner of Polyface Farms (I belive his name was Jim). I applaud this mother/daughter team and my heart goes out to their cause. I just loved the enthusiasm and devotion of Polyface Farms to maintain a 'natural' ecological focus for what he produces. Polyface educates us as to the importance of why we should eat organically. And don't forget those GMO's (not associated with Polyface)...you've got to hear about that one!<br /><br />I was already on course for eating well, but this has just put me over the fence as to why I should eat organically.

I already have been making many things at home to avoid all of those corn based ingredients (it's hard enough to avoid HFCS and sugar!), this just puts us on a faster track to being even more decisive in what products we buy.

I learned a lot, and I felt this was an important enough issue to purchase the movie so that I could share it with others.  I particularly like the fact that they didn't alienate meat-eaters--the corruption carries over to corn, soy beans, you name it.  The basic message is this:  Know where your food comes from!

112011,B002LBKDYE, A2BP8HBDI0NKQY,5.0, Missing Feedback loop ( pun intended ),"Eye opening movie about the state of food production and the industry that has grown up around delivering this basic need.  You only get one body, and at least in the near term, we only get one planet.  We better start acting like good stewards of God's Creation.  This is not a shunning of capitalism, nor science, it is the lack of a good feedback loop in the process of improving food delivery.<br /><br />I buy organic, not just because I think the organic methods are always better, it is because of the additional scrutiny in the process of the delivery of the food.  I think that companies built around quality make a better model of how products should be produced.  I think they treat their workers better, take more care in the creation of the food since they know the ""organic"" label is valuable, and they treat their animals better.  Labeling is what allows consumers to vote with their dollars.<br /><br />It is indefensible to think we are not allowing food to be labelled properly and allow the end consumer to know what they are buying!  This is the feedback loop to tell the producers what the consumers expect.  The ""Free Market"" does not work when the labeling is insufficient to allow for this essential feedback loop.  Our government is corrupt, without a doubt, and we need more accountability and transparency in this process.<br /><br />The Monsanto lawsuits are the most disturbing thing in this movie, I agree that a company can protect their patents for a period of time, to allow for fair compensation, but using the legal system to financially subjugate individuals that participate in the food delivery chain is a perversion of the law!  This is very disturbing, this may be why we have the second amendment.<br /><br />Our government is a product of the populace, Thomas Jefferson put it best ""Whenever people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government"" -TJ<br /><br />We are responsible, we the voters must assert our rights to good food, humanely raised food, good governance is our responsibility.  We can not just blame big business or capitalism, or our government.  We are the government, we are big business, we are capitalists.  We have a soul and we are not just animals, we should act like it.<br /><br />Thank you for this movie, God bless.","Food, Inc"
112012,B002LBKDYE, ADZF3QDGSZE7K,5.0, Good documentary with just a slight bias,"I'm a deer hunting, steak eating, Texan, but I have to say this movie does connect the dots pretty well about the US food supply and does it without too much bias. In fact the only scenes of chickens getting killed are from the segment on the 'good' farmer who does free range foods.<br /><br />With gas prices over $4, bottled water over $2, how can a burger really sell for $1??? Bottom line is you get what you pay for - lots of calories in an extremely non-nutritious meal. Free range and traditionally grown foods just taste better! If nothing else the movie will reaffirm that obvious fact.","Food, Inc"

Thanks to Oprah, i would have kept suspecting what was happening to our food. But now I Know about the tons of antibiotics and the geneticly altered foods that we eat. We as a Nation have a right to know. It's the corporations that have taken our rights away in a underhanded way. As a nation we have always been told that united we stand divided we fall. We have become so trusting in our food. The doctors have been questioning why are So many people so Sick? Why does America have a weight issue, what about illegal immigration? well this explains that too. It also gives you Hope that if we bind together and stand up for ourselves. we CAN change these companies, AND our political system. I recommend that everyone watches this video. It's powerful, It's informative, It's matter of fact. every company that is represented in this documentary has had the opportunity to be interviewed but for some reason they declined. So much to hide and too much money to loose. the CEO's of these companies don't care about the health of the American people, it all come down to Money. What do we care about? Money or our health? Do we really care about the future of our children? they won't have one if we allow the companies to carry on like they have.

Most people probably don't even want to watch this movie because they don't want to know the truth, but that's just it - this is our reality and we're kidding ourselves if we stay in the dark.<br /><br />Anyway, after seeing this movie, I no longer have any desire to eat meat unless I know exactly where it came from and how it was raised, which is really expensive (even in a Northern California, farm town with plenty of sustainable and organic farms).  So, watching this movie has proved the best diet, since I no longer look at food as casually as I once did.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert! I think the most enlightening part of the movie for me was seeing how skewed our food purchasing system has become that fresh vegetables are more expensive than Sugary soda and hamburgers. Weren't meat and sugar supposed to be the expensive items?  Well they are, but thanks to subsidies, poorer Americans are basically force fed crap until they get diabetes or a heart attack.<br /><br />Oh, I could go on, just watch the movie, you won't be the same afterwords, but, you owe it to yourself to know the truth.","Food, Inc"

I personally don't eat much beef, so I am glad for the help to promote a healthier choice. Getting the word out is what is needed. The television media has only focused on certain areas, and left out much of the background that is the reasons behind the problems we now have. Clearly the large corporations need to take more responsibility for what has happened, and is still happening. Yes we, as individuals have to make the right choices and be responsible about it. For many people, they can only trust on the food that is offered at a reasonable cost to feed their family and hope that it is healthy food. Many people don't realize just how much fillers they are getting instead of healthy food. Thanks for helping to get the word out.","Food, Inc"
112051,B002LBKDYE, A38C9ERUM236Z7,5.0, Food Inc is a must-see!,"After finding out this DVD was on sale after Michael Pollan was on Oprah, I just had to get it! It arrived in brand new, perfect condition. I had already seen the movie, but I felt I had to have my own copy of it in order to share it with friends and family who have not seen it yet. Americans need to know where their food is coming from and they need to make conscious decisions everytime they shop because each item purchased IS a vote. A must-see for all, especially those people who eat tons of meat and processed foods without a care. Of course, I understand that their are people in this world who can't exactly afford food other than this (I was one of them), but if you can afford to make smart decisions when purchasing food, please try your best to do so. This movie will compel you to do so.","Food, Inc"
112052,B002LBKDYE, A2KV9P24E3YQZH,5.0, Eye-Opening Perspective,"This documentary is an eye-opener to our food system.  As a result, I have started buying free-range, non-antibiotic/hormone injected poultry and grass-fed beef.  The switch was not an expensive one, as I had originally thought. Another take away from this film was the need for our government to subsidize not only corn and soy (because of big corporation lobbyists), but to also subsidize other produce grown in this country.  Its no wonder low income families flock to cheaper CORN-fed, corn-derived foods and skip the vitamin enriched pricey produce.  Pay now for good food or pay later for diabetic health care under our current system OR get onboard to change food policy.","Food, Inc"

Unfortunately, when you live a busy life it can easily be pushed to the side, but when I saw this film I thought everyone should take the time to watch this film and get a small glimpse of what is really going on with our food. It is no wonder why so many diseases have taken a hold on our lives. Its truly terrifying to think that something as simple as eating a hamburger can kill you. We all have to eat and to think that we now have to add to the worry that the food we eat could potentially be harming us. I don't know about you, but I am prepared to make better choices for myself and my health and in turn my voice will be heard through my shopping habbits.....I better make them good!

The business of food production in our country is... well, a business.

112067,B002LBKDYE, A13YL3Q2KPNX56,5.0, Eye opener,I highly recommend this movie to all adults.  Some of the scenes of killing food animals may not be appropriate for kids.  I didn't realize the extent that the government and big corporations had taken over our food industry.  It is a must see.  It has changed the way I shop for my family's food.,"Food, Inc"
112068,B002LBKDYE, A3V62YC0HCHV0,5.0, A real eye opener,Im so happy I purchased this DVD it has shed so much light on whats going on in the meat industry. All the deception that we are not even aware of. How our meat and chicken is being mass produced for the sake of making more money and how our health is not even an issue to these big corporations. If you want to know whats really going on in the meat industry get this DVD after seeing this you will never eat meat the same again.,"Food, Inc"
112069,B002LBKDYE, A1B7Q3DRDLYLPM,5.0, Food Inc.,The documentary was powerful and eye opening to how America's food sources and processing is frankly harmful to American's.

There wasn't a company showcased in the moved that would send a spokesperson to defend their operations.  Which is unacceptable.  My husband and I have 100% turned away from fast food and the every day grocery store.  We drive 13 miles to a Fresh Market and EarthFare so that we are not bombarded with the unnecessary chemicals in the meats from everyday suppliers.

How amazing what goes on that we hear nothing about.  There are a few parts that are somewhat disgusting...but the truth needs to be told.  Farmers can't even be farmers anymore.  They are so regulated by big corporations.  The widespread uses of antibiotics sure explains the current rise in infections that cannot be cured with ordinary antibiotics.  I have watched the movie 3 times now, and am still learning more each time.  If anyone wants to learn more about our food sources, and what goes on behind the scenes...this movie is a must.  I hope it takes home the Oscar.  Fast Food Nation and The Omnivore's Dilemna are also two good books that deal with the same subject matter.<br /><br />NO MORE FAST FOOD FOR ME!","Food, Inc"

The influence that fast food has had on the way our food is produced is downright scary.  I was a regular at McDonald's (and others) before seeing this movie, and now I select my meals out very carefully.

I have a lot of thinking and changing to do just from watching this movie. It needs to be told, I hope more people listen and want to make a change. It makes me think that maybe a global disaster would not be so bad, then maybe these big corporations and laws would be null. Just back to the good old days where people had to work for their food. Where food was grown the healthy way. I am sick to my stomach over this. I am not sure where to start but I will do what I can and go from there.","Food, Inc"

I have been a careful consumer in regards to food for about 7 years now and was horrified to see where our food really comes from.<br /><br />This movie would have also been so dreadfully depressing if it wasn't for farmer Joel Saladin, he was the ray of sunlight, the breath of fresh air,  the glimmer of hope and with a lot of pressure from consumers the way farming will be done in the future. Though it was hard to watch the killing floors of the pigs, the exploitation of non-documented workers at meat plants, the raping of the American farmers and the utter disdain for life, this movie will make you aware of what is really happening.","Food, Inc"
112089,B002LBKDYE, A7ATZ67DGP5OD,5.0, It's about time this info went mainstream!,"So many people having been waiting for truthful information to be given to the population, at large.  Another wonderful documentary is simply titled, ""Eat"" by Mike Anderson.  Another step toward revealing truths:  to enter into the truth about our pharmaceutical houses and our medical professions that are nothing, if not big business today.  I am an old R.N.  I entered my profession, as a young nurse, when hospitals and physicians were charitable...when the practice of medicine was truly about the patient's care.  And, I was there to witness big business coming in and changing the focus of practice in the medical professions.  They systematically dehumanized the practice of medicine, stopped long term studies of drugs and began pushing dangerous drugs through to increase their profit margin.  They profit largely off of cancer patients.  Chemo-Therapy does not work and it can and does kill! But, the physicians make an 80% profit on all prescribed and administered chemo.  The general public doesn't know this. The phrase ""cost-effective"" was coined and the main focus became about the money.  Now, that we are embarking on a return to food ethics, let's do a different kind of lobbying with our political representatives to stop the promotion of unhealthy foods, the marketing and prescribing of dangerous drugs, (in fact, we need our physicians to also become pharmacists....what a doctor knows about a new drug is what a pharmaceutical salesperson (a legal pusher) tells him.  Most people do not know this.  Isn't that frightening?) We need to keep it simple in our own lives.  There is a lifestyle where what you eat can prevent you from ever needing a physician or his prescription pad (unless you were in an accident).  Look into Dr. John McDougall, either his website or his books sold right here at Amazon....or Drs. Joel Fuhrman,  Caldwell Esselstyn, John Robbins, Dean Ornish, Neal Barnard, and T. Colin Campbell and his ground-breaking research and book, ""The China Study"".  They all have informative and vastly helpful websites and they all have books.  This is just for starters....the truth has been recovered, researched and retested and the population of those in ""the know"" is now huge.  Big Business is killing us and they do not care.  They care about profits and that is all. Period.  And, Big Business, oftimes, is envisioned as more material...like Steel Mills or the Car Industry, or the world of finance..but do not be fooled...Drugs are an astronomical business, Hospitals are Big Business, Doctors and medical equipment are Big Business and Food is Such a Big Business that CHEMICAL COMPANIES, that's right CHEMICAL COMPANIES have patented and own the seeds.  Doesn't it seem a bit strange to you that a chemical company has anything to do with food?  They have taken corn and actually sterilized and genetically modified the seed, so that independent farmers cannot save their own seed anymore to use to plant next years corn.  No, no...Monsanto and Dow have made it so the poor farmers have to buy seed from them every year.  The seed that is grown every year is now sterile and genetically modified and cannot produce new plants when put in the ground.  And, that is another thing...in other countries when food is genetically modified it has to be labeled as such, so the consumer can make educated choices.  If they don't want food that has been genetically modified they can read the label and know if it has been or not.  But, in the big business unethical world of the  USA, there aren't any laws to inform or protect us.  We are being fooled, on purpose.  We are constantly manipulated.  We need to exercise our gifts of discernment and proceed with caution.","Food, Inc"

Not only are we suffering, our children are suffering, and dis-eases as being allowed to proliferate and kill individuals every day as a result of the processing that is taking place!<br /><br />Watching the Oprah Show may have saved my life and members of my families life, it's that simple!  This FOOD SYSTEM is killing you!  Do yourself and YOUR FAMILY a favor and start shopping local.  Find local vendors and use them and stop buying and feeding your family the crap that they so arrogantly put on the market!  I know many people who have illnesses that have become RAMPANT since this processing started, going green has changed their LIFE AND THEIR HEALTH!  Think about all of the chemicals that they are using to process those meats, and the fact that you are ingesting those chemicals, and the fact that you have allergies, and the fact that you have hormonal imbalances, and the fact that you have no energy, and the fact that you have CANDIDA, and the fact that your child has a learning disability, and the fact that your hair is falling out, and the fact that your child can't control their temper, and the fact that you have fibro, ADHD, lyme disease, thyroid disorders, mental illness, constipation, gerd, etc.  That list is long and while the doctors will be happy to provide you with a prescription, the prescription that will cost you a little bit more on the front end but HAS NO SIDE EFFECTS, is ORGANIC FOODS!  Save your life today AND VOTE WITH YOUR POCKETBOOK, THREE TIMES A DAY!!!<br /><br />YES, this prescription will take you more time, YES this prescription means that you have to cook EVERYTHING, yes it will get you closer to your family, YES, YES, YES, but in the long run you'll feel better so you can exercise and feel good about it and have more energy to spend with your family!:)","Food, Inc"

112111,B002LBKDYE, A2BOW7LWR2KA27,5.0, A Gentle Nightmare....,"The Apocalypse is coming in the form of a Quarter Pounder. As powerful and alarming as ""Food, Inc."" is, it's still probably too tame and restrained to convey just how horrendous our food system is. This really needs to be a 10 hour series that goes into extreme depth and detail, and is shown in every school and to every congressperson. I have tried to stop eating meat ever since I traveled through Texas cattle country 20 years ago. It's a scene as bad as any from Nazi Germany, the cattle pens resemble bleak concentration camps. And the stench is so extremely foul, it hits you many miles down the road, and then it stays with you for days, and weeks. A nightmare. I say I've tried to stop eating meat, but I am not perfect and have my weak moments. I eat much less meat than most people, and that's good, but I can do better. The big problem is that it's not just meat that's causing so much damage to our society. It's corn syrup and soy products, which are in nearly everything we consume. Even Batteries! So it's more than a little frustrating and confusing. There are a few good answers and positive ideas presented here, but we need more and we need 'em Fast. Technically, the film is superbly made, covers a very wide spectrum of the condition, and manages to not leave me feeling too hopeless and depressed. I do that fine all by myself. So, even though I don't think it goes nearly far enough to make us, all of us, realize that our Doom and Demise is accelerated by our irresponsible and inhuman food choices, I highly recommend ""Food, Inc.""","Food, Inc"

In the food industry they literally own the patent rights to the seeds(read Seeds of Destruction by William F. Engdahl). They(a few monopolies) own the whole food process from seeds to the supermarkets/restaurants. Not only do they own the govrnments regulators/they are the government regulators, not only in the food industry, but the banking industry, the pharmaceutical, the media, you name it/it's been privitized to monopoly ownership. Even the U.S. Government has been privitized through a lobbied/corporate media electoral 2-party dictatorship.<br />This movie is unfortunately just the tip of the titanic ice berg that is not melting but ready to produce another titantic ""bubble"" called ""Cap and Trade"".<br /> Tune In & drop out of the mainstream propaganda and start reading from a variety of sources. The more mainstream/government, the more suspect.<br /> By virtue of the fact that this movie has been made and distributed widely speaks of the real hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel. The more that people search for that light the more there will be for us all. Truth may be slow, but it is more powerful than the privitized lie. The Public may be Privitization's enemy # 1, but the truth is racing to beat...monpolies/oligopolies lies that race around the world many times over before truth can even tie it's shoe strings.<br /><br /> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!<br /><br />P.S.

112134,B002LBKDYE, A1Y3VFBUJZLVHV,5.0, Viewed Tonight,"This documentary was fantastic. Are there better ones out there on this subject? Sure. ""The Future of Food"" was particularly good, but ""Food, Inc."" is a film a larger audience can relate to. That's my opinion anyway. I'm seriously thinking of sending copies of this film as a holiday gift to friends. I understand the blight of the chicken house industry that was once vibrant in parts of the South and have heard personal stories of people going in serious debt as a result. Up here living in the Midwest, corn and corn-fed beef (and ethanol) are all the rage. News of raids and deportation of immigrant workers in Postville, Iowa, doesn't arouse as much public concern as one might hope. Though people in this state do celebrate farmers' markets and have fabulous locally-grown produce. Interesting to behold the organic movement catching on right in America's Heartland where much of the corn is grown. I hope it catches on more in the future and we can break our dependence on the failing food system we have now.<br /><br />I learned of Polyface Farm years back and wish we had access to their products out this way, but understand that violates their principle of keeping it local. The Polyface Inc. website lists restaurants where their products are used and ""metropolitan buying clubs"" for interested consumers in Virginia and Maryland. That's really nice how they have their sustainable farming business running, and I'd love for us to protect the few smaller family farms we have left out this way. Organic farming is such a good idea.<br /><br />Monsanto is the closest thing to pure evil I've yet to confront. Wow. The more I learn about them, the more shocked I am that people haven't sounded alarms sooner. Aside from creating Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, they now provide a variant on RoundUp Ultra for our U.S. drug policy aerial fumigation campaign in Colombia, which is causing a humanitarian crisis in case anyone didn't know. Monsanto is also behind the global ""boom"" in golf courses, which rely on their lawncare products. Read up on biological patents and Monsanto and see how many patents they have accumulated. This is a company we seriously need to avoid from here on out, even if that means accepting a few weeds from time to time, mmmmk?

Watching and supporting this film is way more important than any charity you could ever think to help. However, it breaks my heart, that because the food industry is so heavily designed to prevent people from knowing the truth, most people will stay ignorant of these truths.<br /><br />Corn, Beef, pork, chicken, fast food, lobbying, lawsuits, monopolies, over-weight, unhealthy chemicals and bacteria, diabetes, poor for the environment, bribed government officials and politicians, illegal immigrants, forcing your employees to remain silent about how they operate- It is all worse then you can possibly imagine, and it could be fixed if people started voting by how they spend their grocery money, and getting the government to stop protecting these insanely greedy and corrupt industries!<br /><br />I am not getting all mushy and saying don't eat, or being kinder to the animals (though they show how that could be better here as well.) What I am talking about is how unhealthy mass-produced food is for you, America and the world. These large companies treat their employees, the animals, the competition and the environment like their worst enemies.<br /><br />This program shouldn't keep you from eating what you want, but I sure do hope it will get people to support the companies that do things right, and that it will get the government to turn its eyes on the companies that don't and force them to have a conscious.

He also weighs about 280.  He's one of the oldest looking 40 year old men that I know.  I'm sure he's still eating a lot of awful food even though he's no longer eating the 29 cent specials and using the Dollar Menu.<br /><br />This movie goes a long way in explaining just why we eat the junk that we do even though it's killing us.  The film shows that we do it partly because it's ridiculously cheap.  It's cheap because the government subsidizes growing the corn that provides us with our starch and sugar.  It's cheap because we treat our farm animals with incredible cruelty in the name of ""efficiency.""<br /><br />The approach in this movie is a bit scattershot, but Food, Inc. does get its points across. I think it would have been far better if the film makers would have ignored the issue of genetically modified foods and patent law and kept focused on the issue of what we eat and why.  That said, overall the movie is well made, and clearly more money was put into this movie than most documentaries. It lifts the veil on the ugly world of agribusiness.  You can read about this issue in books, but seeing it with your own eyes is something else entirely. What you see in this movie likely will make you change your diet for the better.","Food, Inc"
112153,B002LBKDYE, A2Z3J6BU4G6KH0,5.0, A Must See Movie for Anyone Who Eats Food,"Food, Inc. is valuable viewing for anyone who eats or feeds their family. The documentary is well made, and really serves as an introduction to the current food production practices that dictate the supply chain of the modern diet. In this video, you will learn:<br /><br />1. That marketing of food products is very misleading. Most marketing attempts to present a wholesome and agrarian image leading consumers to believe that their foods come from natural and beautiful farms. Yet in reality most food comes from extremely unpleasant, and oftentimes barbaric, food factories.<br /><br />2. Corporatization in a consumer society is destroying quality of life. When nothing matters but the bottom line and decisions are made in board rooms thousands of miles away from actual sites, where the primary concern is profit, quality goes out the window. Even worse, we begin to view living creatures as nothing but a collection of molecules that can and should be manipulated to maximize profit in the shortest amount of time, with total disregard to the pain and suffering caused to them. Consequently, it becomes accepted practice to subject them to a miserable and unnatural life, pump them with hormones and antibiotics, mutilate and hurt them callously, and so on. This in turn leads us to perceive fellow human beings in the same way, and the world in general as simply raw material that needs to be harvested for immediate gain by the most powerful. Classic corollary of merciless Darwinian thinking...<br /><br />3. It's not all doom and gloom. YOU have the power to make choices that will force multi-national corporations to change their practices by necessity. Educating yourself and your family, with information such as in this documentary, is critical to not only saving yourself and your loved ones from misery and victimhood out of ignorance, but in also creating global change. A great case study is presented in Food, Inc. where the largest retailer in the world, Walmart, has now chosen to carry organic and hormone-free products because their consumers have chosen it.<br /><br />4. Much more. There are lots of other topics and lessons one can gleam from this, and by making simple changes in the way we live and in the choices we make, we can begin returning to a more natural, fulfilling life. This is essential for future generations, for our children. Do we really want to pass onto them the world we inherited, where they are being exploited and manipulated out of ignorance? It's up to us to create change. Now is the time.<br /><br />Enjoy!","Food, Inc"

Little by little, I've made improvements, and it's the information gleaned from books and documentaries like this one that have caused me to make those incremental changes.  Good ones.  If you don't have as much of a background in food stuff, watch the movie for sure!  And maybe add a few things to your reading list: The Omnivore's Dilemma, In Defense of Food, Super-Size Me, Fast Food Nation, and anything else you hear about while you're learning more.  There are few things in life that contribute as much to who we are as what we eat.  And there are few ways that we can make as great an environmental impact as in our food purchasing decisions.

It really is shocking what we are being fed, and I don't mean that just in a literal sense!<br /><br />For those considering buying or watching the DVD.  The documentary moves at a good pace. It doesn't deliberately seek to shock you with graphic scenes, or express a bias that we should all become vegetarians. What it does do is take the veil off the packaging to reveal many ugly and hidden truths. The good thing here is that KNOWLEDGE IS POWER and our power is visible with each food item we choose to purchase.<br /><br />Many thanks to the brave makers of this film.

112158,B002LBKDYE, ADSTKCE7IXB29,5.0, Loved the eccentric independent farmer!,"This is one of the best social responsibility themed documentaries I have ever watched. I feel that this documentary covers all the bases on animal fair-treatment, the food safety impacts of industrial farming, and sustainable food production practices.<br /><br />Food Inc goes in depth on the production operations of a sustainable Virginia chicken, beef, and pork farmer. This farmer is probably at least a little eccentric, but everything he says about pigs exercising their ""pigness"" and cows being cows makes total sense. He invited the cameras in to see how he raises, feeds, and even slaughters the animals. The film treats very fairly the contrast between this approach and the approach that industrial-scale meat packer Perdue requires its farmers to follow.<br /><br />The film provides some focus to food safety, particularly as it relates to the role industrial processes play in promoting toxic e. coli proliferation. Alas, the film fails to make as clear a case for how e. coli has become such a problem as it has for the issues related to fair treatment of animals.<br /><br />I appreciated the film's exploration of public food subsidies and how they impact food choices and public health. We follow a low-income Los Angeles-area family that is forced to buy cheap fast food instead of broccoli due to price and time. To summarize, a hamburger would be more expensive, but corn, soybean, and wheat overproduction paid for by the US farm-subsidy bills feeds cows and keeps beef cheaper than it should be.<br /><br />There were pretty naive complaints of Monsanto's practice of prohibiting farmers from using the seeds that are naturally produced season after season on-farm by the plants it has engineered and patented. Monsanto prosecutes farmers doing this because this cuts into Monsanto's sales -- there's no reason to buy Monsanto's product if you can, in essence, re-use their product season after season. Unfortunately, the arguments were only skin deep and were akin to those that throw up their hands at the fact that pharmaceuticals cost so damn much money. Yeah, the seeds only cost a a tenth of a cent to produce, but the first seed cost $100 million, so what is Monsanto to do? Food Inc should have probed this issue deeper.<br /><br />I would encourage anyone watching the DVD-version to catch the extras. The deleted scenes could have easily been rolled into the feature but for length.","Food, Inc"
112159,B002LBKDYE, A2844X9VRQNMW,5.0, Eye-Opener,"Loved this DVD...yes, its true that much of this has been covered in the Fast Food Nation, Super-Size Me etc etc...but this really captures the sinister nature of the greed involved. As pointed out in the documentary, there are multiple unintended consequences of corporate greed. Sometimes the visual is more potent than the written word, and to witness the inhumane treatment of animals makes this more powerful than the best-selling books. The DVD also offers hope - i.e. things don't have to be this way, and we can make changes by the way we purchase. Excellent.","Food, Inc"

112162,B002LBKDYE, A3PZGCDIEDZ42U,5.0, Excellent Documentary--a MUST see for every American or Human,"I viewed this movie with the complimentary tickets granted by Chipotle at an independent movie theater here in the Portland area. This movie is a must see for every American.  The companies mentioned in the movie DO NOT want you to see this, as it would threaten their very evil existence. It was shocking to learn the companies can sue you for criticizing them in any shape or form.  The food chain is out of control here and something needs to be done to bring it down to earth again.  We cannot keep consuming the way we do. The problems of today, are a result of a system gone awfully wrong, and in the hands of a few, who want to personally gain from it.  They are not looking out for the interests of you and me, but merely their own pocket books.  This movie will educate the consumer that we DO HAVE the power to stop such practices. We do have the power to change something for the better.  It's not just another pep rally movie to promote some alternative lifestyle....These are facts and they affect EVERYONE of us....Definitely looking forward to the DVD and will purchase to share the knowledge with all I know.","Food, Inc"

112166,B002LBKDYE, A1IM0FWX6NMYMC,1.0," ""Beware of the sound of one hand clapping""","""Beware of the sound of one hand clapping.""  That is, the first side<br />of a story always sounds credible until you hear from the other side.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching Food Inc. twice.  Amazing cinematic production<br />and very entertaining. Although I disagreed w/ 90% of the film, it did<br />make some good points, and certainly promotes conversation.<br /><br />I think the movie misses the biggest point of all: Americans are<br />hedonistic, pleasure-seeking folk who want their cake and to eat it too,<br />and now we're overweight and looking for someone else to blame rather<br />than practicing *self control.*<br /><br />My take?  There's a lot they left out of the movie.  I believe people<br />should be given an *objective* view of the facts and then make up their<br />own minds rather than being presented only one side.  For example,<br />consider the following.<br /><br />1.  First, let me say that in 2001 I converted over to organic food<br />to become healthier.  It didn't take me long to figure out that the<br />large organic farming companies are just as greedy and deceptive as<br />the conventional companies.  Many false claims are made to promote<br />their very expensive products.  After a while, I realized I wasn't<br />getting any healthier and didn't have enough money to keep buying the<br />organic, which has never* been shown to be healthier than<br />conventional produce.  The moral of this whole story?  ""Follow the<br />money trail.""  For example, the raw milk craze is based on people who<br />stand to make millions of dollars.  Raw milk is a highly lucrative<br />business and people are dying from drinking it, unfortunately.<br /><br />2. Everyone believes producers put hormones in chicken feed. . . if they did,<br />the companies would go out of business because hormones<br />*don't work* in chickens as in beef.  It's throwing money down a hole.<br />Chickens grow off bigger today because we've bred them to have larger<br />breast muscles and have bred for faster growth, just like we've bred dairy<br />cows to have large udders and small muscles.<br /><br />3. The angry chicken farmer woman in the movie refused to retrofit her<br />chicken house w/ a tunnel ventilation cooling system.  She wanted to<br />keep making her $25,000 per house profit ($100,000 for four houses)<br />and not put money back into the system.  The poultry companies<br />cannot afford to let those old school people keep their contracts<br />b/c the birds w/ open sided houses are much hotter and<br />uncomfortable, and it takes more feed and more time to grow the birds<br />off.  Very inefficient.  Tunnel ventilation-cooled poultry houses are<br />like air conditioning.<br /><br />4. The movie presents a false image of poultry farming as taking<br />advantage of the farmers.  Some of the richest people in the south are<br />chicken farmers.  Currently, you cannot contract w/ a poultry company<br />unless you build (1) six chicken houses x $25,000 profit each =<br />$150,000 profit/year,  (2) ONLY a 15 year mortgage, so in 15 years,<br />you OWN the place and all you have to spend is upkeep, and (3) the<br />company brings you all the chicks, all the feed, a veterinarian, any<br />medications you need, and then picks the chickens up after 4-7 weeks.<br />There are hundreds of people who have left highly lucrative careers in<br />the south to go into poultry farming because they could make more<br />money there.  Now get this. . . On top of all of that, most people w/6<br />houses hire a farm hand to run the farm for them, then the farmer only<br />has to work 10 or 20 hours a week.<br /><br />5. Remember the poor pitiful family that wouldn't cook their own food<br />at home?  They would spend $12 for hamburgers and sodas in their car,<br />but said that broccoli was too expensive at $1.29 a pound.(??)  For $5<br />they could have made 3.5 pounds of cheese broccoli.  ""But I don't like<br />cheese broccoli"" someone might say.  ""OK, well, that's why you're<br />fat,"" I might say.  Just because a person doesn't like eating healthy<br />food, doesn't mean they should blame their health problems on others.<br /><br />Furthermore, the oldest daughter of that family had upper and lower<br />*BRACES* on her teeth.  So, the family could afford $6,000 to<br />straighten her teeth, but couldn't pay $3.87 for three pounds of<br />broccoli and now they blame everyone else but themselves for their bad<br />choices and the father's diabetes.(?)  Also, the oldest daughter had time<br />to go to a psychological support group counseling session to help her<br />deal with the fact that her father has diabetes, but she doesn't have<br />time to cook her family some beans and rice.(??)  Some Asian friends I went<br />to college with claimed they could eat for $30 a month.  How?  They<br />bought 40 lb. sacks of rice and cooked rice and dried beans.<br /><br />6.  A large part of the movie was related to GMO soybeans, which<br />allows farmers to grow record levels of soybeans on very small pieces<br />of land.  Why do you think 90% of farmers use the GMO soybean seed described<br />in the film?  Because they have greater yields and make *more money*<br />than with the old seed.  Companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars<br />developing and promoting these products (which is why it is patented)<br />but now the guy who cleans seeds isn't willing to respect the company's<br />intellectual property rights and isn't willing to change with the<br />times.  Furthermore, GMO crops have never been shown to be harmful to<br />us or the environment.<br /><br />7. The American Meat Institute is the trade association (spokesman)<br />for the meat industry.  It speaks for the companies so they won't get<br />in trouble and get sued.  AMI has requested since 1998 to be<br />interviewed by the producer of Food Inc. and to be included in the<br />2009 movie, but Food Inc. denied them this.  An articulate,<br />intellectual response to their ideas would ruin the whole show.<br /><br />8. If America went 100% organic, we would have to deforest the country to grow<br />enough food for everyone.  Modern agriculture is many times more efficient<br />than we were 100 years ago, meaning we are using less land than we would be<br />using under the old system.  Thus, modern farming is more environmentally-friendly<br />with regard to carbon emissions, greenhouse<br />gases, and land usage.<br /><br />9. Some supermarket chains have been pressured into only selling milk<br />from cows that have not been given hormones.  The fact is that hormones<br />*do not* enter the milk of the cow.  The meat?  Yes.  The milk?  No.<br />What does this mean?  It means the supermarket chains now use milk<br />produced *less efficiently*, requiring more feed, more land, more<br />money, and more natural resources.  Reducing hormone usage in cattle<br />reduces milk and meat efficiency which leads to a greater environmental<br />burden.<br /><br />10. The movie demonizes raising cattle in feedlots.  The fact is,<br />cattle are pasture-raised (grass-fed, hay-fed) for years and then for<br />the last 5 months, they are fattened up in feed lots.  It has never<br />been proven that grass-fed cattle lead to lower cases of E. coli than<br />feedlot cattle.  Currently, there is an E. coli strawberry outbreak<br />in Oregon.  Guess where they traced the E. coli back to?  DEER feces,<br />from grass-fed deer.<br /><br />11. Another myth is that hormones in conventional beef are causing<br />girls to mature faster.  The fact is, girls reaching puberty is<br />contingent on the amount of *body fat* they have, because excess fat<br />leads to excess hormone production in the body.  That's why female<br />olympic gymnists often don't reach puberty until they are in their<br />20's, because they have almost zero body fat.  A fat adolescent who<br />eats only organics is going to reach puberty BEFORE a skinny<br />adolescent who eats conventional hormone-produced beef at every-meal.<br />Why are girls reaching puberty faster today?  Because our society is<br />overweight.  Weight problems are at epidemic proportions in grades<br />3-6, thus the situation w/ the girls.<br /><br />12. The world's population is growing at 0.5% a year.  We can't afford<br />to go back to the old inefficient system.<br /><br />13.  The current scientific data says that conventional vs. organic foods<br />are equivalent in nutrition and safety (except for unpasteurized milk,<br />which is more dangerous).<br /><br />Are there problems with the modern system?  Certainly.  We can go over<br />those sometime, if you like.<br /><br />My Recommendations?<br /><br />First and foremost, hear both sides of the story.  Beyond that:<br /><br />1. Don't overeat.  Don't get diabetes or heart disease.  Excess body<br />fat is also the single *biggest* predictor of contracting cancer<br />(besides smoking, of course).<br /><br />2. Cut back on saturated fat and refined carbohydrates (e.g., sugar,<br />white flours, breads, pastas, crackers, chips, potatoes).<br /><br />3. Eat high fiber (buy the high fiber or double fiber bread, fiber<br />cereal, etc.) including more fruits and vegies.<br /><br />4. I take sugar-free generic brand Metamucil every night.  It<br />contains soluble fiber that *sucks up* fat like a sponge so your body<br />won't.  I also take it after I eat any fatty-type meal.  It will lower<br />your triglycerides and lower your LDL bad cholesterol and raise your<br />HDL good cholesterol.  In the past year, I've increased my good (HDL)<br />cholesterol from 40 to 60 with fiber + 1,000 mg niacin a day, and have<br />dropped my triglyceride levels from in the high range to the low<br />range.<br /><br />5. Remove *PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED* oils<br />from your diet, which contain trans-fats - bad.<br /><br />6. Exercise 30 min. a day.","Food, Inc"

Followed by the current alignment in the food pyramid.<br /><br />Today, with factory farming and Corporate food manufacturing extending even to farm crops that are chemically manipulated, radiated, in order to produce a more voluminous product for the ballooning consumer population, is it any wonder that old lunch room posters proclamation still rings true?<br /><br />We are what we eat.<br /><br />And that goes a long way to explain the cancers that plague our eliminatory organs;bowels, colon, rectum, stomach. As well as our impotence, given the byproducts that we absorb when we consume the flesh of animals that have been plumped to market beyond what nature and a decent diet would allow. Steroids, testosterone, estrogen, growth hormone, anti-biotics so as to stave off the infections factory farmed animals risk acquiring while warehoused for fattening and butchering.<br /><br />The videos of sick cows being forklift prodded toward the stun gun so they can be killed and butchered and cut into pieces so that their dead flesh can be injected with red dye and placed under plastic wrap to look fit for the table.<br /><br />Chickens, save for Purdue farms, who are fed a diet that includes their own excrement (Talk about you are what you eat!) and are also injected to be fatter, plumper, and produce a fatter bird for the price of a meal.<br /><br />Is it any wonder then that women suffer breast cancer, and reproductive organ cancers? And the number one killer of women is heart disease?<br /><br />Do we actually think byproducts of big business farming isn't going to affect us?<br /><br />We are what we eat! And we're reaping what we sew.<br /><br />This movie will wake you up so that the next trip to the grocery store, hopefully, makes for an informed consumer. And if you're fortunate enough to afford it, it could be a trip to an organic fresh foods supermarket, where free range meats, with no chemical saturation, are sold. Where free range eggs, milk, butters, cheeses, don't promise a meal with huge detrimental side effects on the menu later.<br /><br />The only reason this big farm business flourishes like this is because we the consumer keep buying into it. And for our money? We suffer and die from the ailments our organs suffer because they simply can't handle the side effects of America's present day diet and food manufacturer.<br /><br />It's worth doing the research and shopping responsibly, even if it's more expensive on the budget, than to pay the price of an affordable diet later, when the cost is far more deadly to the self than it was to the pocketbook.","Food, Inc"

Most people are aware of the horrendous conditions for workers and animals in the huge factories and slaughterhouses around the country, but we choose to push those images out of our minds - so I wasn't surprised with that aspect of this film. I WAS however, shocked to see that the food industry is about as consolidated and domineering as the media industry is. Did you know that KASHI is owned by Kellogg's?

I'm not sure how biased of a perspective it is, but it definitely does get you thinking.<br /><br />There are arguments by the food multinationals that at current food production levels (bushels/acre) there is not enough arable land to feed the world's population. The key to ensuring food supply is increasing the efficiency (bushels/acre) of the land so that enough food can be produced.<br /><br />However, this makes you question the economic, human, and health costs of the industrialized state of the industry.

112205,B002LBKDYE, A3OMLN90WK8Z66,5.0," Monsanto, Tyson's, ADM, etc., decline to comment.","This isn't Michael Pollan's film, but his comments nevertheless stand out to me. Pollan's logic is irrefutable. Has anyone heard a cogent rebuttal to him from Monsanto or Tyson's or the Iowa Farm Bureau? No, they just fume about how ""food activists"" are taking cheap shots at the good and noble and virtuous occupation of farming. Their standard mantra is that American farmers produce safe, cheap, and nutritious food. But they cannot have it both ways--declining to be interviewed and then charging food journalists with unbalanced reporting. They do not answer the hard questions about modern agribusiness (it's not farming anymore) because they cannot.<br /><br />Two contrasting images stand out for me in the film. One is the image of the coldly efficient slaughterhouse. The other is of Joel Salatin butchering chickens. Are the images morally equivalent? I think not. There is nothing intrinsically evil about slaughtering animals. But the modern mega-slaughterhouse is evil. (Cue Iowa Farm Bureau  rebuttal mantra.) CAFO's are evil. Local processing is the way animals should be slaughtered. (Cue USDA warning on trying this without jumping through their regulatory hoops.) And it isn't just the slaughterhouse that is evil. The whole industrial-agriculture production system is morally corrupt, including the regulatory apparatus. (As noted in the film, the ""regulatory apparatus"" tried to close Joel Salatin down.)<br /><br />I like the end of the film alot because it offers practical recommendations. It is very simple. The recommended action is: vote with your pocketbook. Change your buying habits. Find new food sources. Stop buying what is unhealthy, start buying what is healthy. Buy local.","Food, Inc"

My eyes are open now to where all that shiny, cheap food comes from and I can never erase that.  I think the most memorable part for me was when Mr. Salatin observes that we don't necessarily want the cheapest cars but we clamor to buy the cheapest food.  And it goes INTO our bodies.<br /><br />Not any more.  My family and I are transitioning over to a non-industrialized diet after watching Food, Inc.  This goes beyond buying organic.  With a little searching we found a family farm here in Ventura County that raises their own chickens and hogs.  We only purchase produce from the local farmers markets now as well.  It's hard at first but it gets easier... it just takes a little more planning.  The payoff has been immeasurable in our conscience and our well-being.<br /><br />Everyone needs to see this movie whatever your political persuasion.

112214,B002LBKDYE, A28LGH89TL0Z0Z,4.0, Enjoyed it completely... all but the elephant in the room,"I completely enjoyed this film, even though yes - the information is found in many other sources, the assembling of the material was well done.<br /><br />The only problem the film seems to neglect is the simple fact is there is too many people for the amount of food required globally.  If sustainability is the end intention of the film, which I believe is the true message, then all this does is draw a call to action to fix (end) the realities of America's manipulation of abundant cheap food which ultimately will result in the same outcome; world hunger due to too many mouths.<br /><br />It is not politically correct to suggest we limit reproduction but essentially that is what is the only true solution to the issues on a global scale which the film dances around (however elegant it might suggest otherwise)  Let's be honest the population of the world looks like a hockey stick and the only result of such explosions upward are sharp corrections downward; which are witnessed in everything from collapsing ecosystems to stock market bubbles.  All are indicative of correction in some form or another and one thing humans have proven time and time again is our ability to ""not change"" until collapse/catastrophe but thankfully we adapt very well and change afterwards.<br /><br />Some of you may feel change can occur to avoid such limitations, or argue redefining the system can meet all our needs but if viewed as a whole - across multiple issues outstanding and the realities of our continued multiplication that in the end it achieves the same result; we are simply a bad case of fleas until the earth decides to rid herself of us - she will.<br /><br />Perhaps Earth Day should be renamed to People Day, since we are the ones at risk of exterminating ourselves... a simple asteroid can reset the whole process over again, and again, and again.. since we may have reached the limitation of this version.","Food, Inc"

112219,B002LBKDYE, A39SCFENDZYIXR,3.0, Interesting and biased,"I found the film to be interesting and worth watching.  Parts of it were truly eye opening.<br /><br />On the other hand there seemed to be an underlying political message beyond food.<br /><br />Some of this message may have been inadvertent bias of the typical pro organic crowd being interviewed such as reference to global warming and opposition to profits.<br /><br />But some issues were repeated throughout the film and obviously the view of the producers.  This centered around pro-union anti free market labor along with the assumption that anything that increases production or lowers cost is automatically bad.<br /><br />What I took away from the film is that the food industry is ruled by a few large companies that wield monopolistic market power and have armies of lawyers and lobbyists that are able to sue and intimidate the little guy an buy favorable treatment in the making of laws and regulation of the industry.<br /><br />The inevitable solution presented was to vote with your wallet and to lobby congress to increase government control over the food industry.<br /><br />Voting with your wallet makes sense, but beyond that, what is really needed in my opinion is for the government to fulfill its duty to ensure free competitive markets which means free of monopolies.  Just as Standard Oil was busted up into 34 companies in the early 1900's the same needs to be done now for these monster food conglomerates.  Unfortunately from the view of the film producers who are quite obviously of a liberal persuasion, much more faith is put in government regulation than in the competition of free markets.  The film producers also clearly call for more monopolies in the form of labor unions and worker collective bargaining.  Again not trusting the free market to pay what they considered to be a reasonable wage.  They showed ads where an American meat packing company was attempting to recruit Mexican workers to come in to their USA plant (illegally crossing the border) where they were advertising $11 per hour.","Food, Inc"

As you watch the movie, you won't want to believe this really happens in our country, but the evidence is right in front of your eyes.<br /><br />It was only a short time ago when I believed our government agencies had our best interest at heart.

112223,B002LBKDYE, A3QNQQKJTL76H0,5.0, Modern factory-farming practices will make you sick to your stomach,"This is a documentary that everyone in America needs to see because food safety is an issue that directly affects us all, no matter who we are or where we live. The film begins with a flyover of the American heartland, zooming out through a painting of a farm house into a stroll down the supermarket aisle, with rows upon rows of products (47,000 in an average supermarket). All neatly packaged and arranged, they present an idyllic image of pastoral life that is completely incongruent with how food is produced today. Narrator, journalist, and UC Berkeley professor Michael Pollan begins, ""the way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000"". Due to technological advances in mass production, mechanization, chemistry, and genetic engineering, the way food is produced now is vastly at odds with the fantasy of an agrarian America from the 30's to 50's that the food industry sells us on. A ""veil"" has been deliberately dropped between us and our food, because if we knew where our food came from, we wouldn't want to eat it anymore.<br /><br />But ignorance is not bliss. It can literally make you sick to your stomach. If the BSE (mad cow's disease) scares and frequent reports of E. coli contamination in everything from hamburger patties to spinach to lettuce to tomatoes in the last several years haven't given you pause about the food you put on your family's dinner table and the trust you place in the companies that supply it, then you definitely need to watch this documentary. Just as recently as November 1 came reports of yet another E. coli breakout (this time from Fairbank Farms, spurring a 500,000+ pound recall, with 2 reported deaths and 11 sick). Anyone who is concerned with the health of his/her family needs to be made aware of the potential risks involved with eating the foods produced by this dangerous system.<br /><br />Food today is less nourishing, less wholesome, and less safe than it was 50 or 60 years ago mainly as a result of large-scale mechanized production and factory-style agricultural practices that sacrifice quality for quantity and focus on making as much food as possible for the lowest cost (more fertilizers, more pesticides, high density feedlots, lower quality feed). We have cheaper, bigger, and faster foods and higher yields than ever before in human history, but such abundance comes at a cost to our health (increase rates of diabetes, obesity, and infection from food-borne pathogens), our land, and the dignity of private farmers and workers. Many of the foods we eat today are dangerously unsafe or unhealthy and this film explores the hidden human, health, and environmental costs of our modern industrial farming system. The topics covered include poultry, pig farming, cattle raising, corn, and being able to patent life (as Monsanto has done with seeds). Cattle, for example, are fed corn (because it is cheap and subsidized by the government), a food their bodies are not designed for, leading to dangerous build up of E. coli in their stomachs. In high density feed lots, they stand knee-deep in their own feces. Feces is everywhere and slaughtered at the rate of several thousands per hour in assembly-line slaughterhouses, it is very easy for the feces to enter the food chain. Ground beef is mixed with beef from thousands of other cows, exponentially increasing the chance of pathogen introduction. If you didn't know from recent news reports of cattle processors using ammonia to kill bacteria, now you do. Do you want to be eating ammonia in your hamburger patty?<br /><br />If you are an educated food consumer, you will already know much of the information presented here from reading the numerous books on the food industry or watching such films as ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKAU"">Fast Food Nation</a>"" (which Eric Schlosser also produced), ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002OXVBO"">Super Size Me</a>"", or PETA videos on animal abuse. This is an excellent and highly informative documentary that all consumers should watch. If there is one criticism, it's that the film tries to cover too many topics within its 90 minute runtime and sacrifices some depth for the sake of a more encompassing view of the entire food industry. It ends on a positive note, and even puts the oft-maligned Walmart in a good light, showing their buyers as being responsive to the demands of its consumers. The more we know about how our food is made, the more we can start demanding more wholesome, safer foods and changing the way these large multinational corporations operate. With the growth of organics and chains like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, the corporations are listening.","Food, Inc"
112224,B002LBKDYE, AJUXOX214J7NG,2.0, Film ignore realities and higlights them,"I agree that most of what is in this film needs to be said.  However, it needs to be said in a different manner.  The film ignores many of the realities of mass farming.  For example, there is a cattle farmer in the film who is proud that he produces organic meat but then states that he doesn't care how far people have to travel to get it.  In essence, he ignores that cattle production (and most other food production) is done in the Plain states for cost and/or climate reasons.  Raising the amount of cattle in the northeast (and other populated areas) where land is expensive and more densely populated, is most likely not a reality.  While I'd like to be proven otherwise, I was hoping the documentary would be more comprehensive on this obvious point.<br /><br />Additionally, there are many leaps of faith in the film that you would have if you were to accept it at face value.  For example, much of the narrative of the film relies on the filmmaker himself reciting facts without referencing any source(s).  Or, as another example, the mother who tragically lost her son to E. Coli refers to two other recent deaths without citing a source of the illnesse.  Outbreaks of E. Coli have been linked to a number of sources, although the film suggests it is mainly the cause of runoff from cattle.  This makes the film seem very impartial and opens it up to much criticism.  I really wanted the film to support the views I already had, but all I could think of is how other people would view this film as a flimsy attack.","Food, Inc"

112233,B002LBKDYE, A16RHKQUIWCVK2,5.0, Really makes you think about where your food comes from,"An excellent film that kept us interested all the way through, except I feel too much time was spent on the woman who lost a child and we fast forwarded through some of that.  I am sorry for her loss but it just dragged on too long.  My skeptical husband since bought the DVD and has been passing it around to friends, who now want me to raise all their chicken and pork for them :-D<br /><br />Unlike PETA films this one does not try to gross you out and make you a vegetarian.  There are a few short graphic scenes but rather than try to sicken you, the message they are trying to get across is how a handful of Big Ag companies control over 80% of America's food supply, and how politically powerful and nearly untouchable these companies are.  It all seems very bleak, but at the end you are told how you can get better control of your own food supply... for example raise whatever you can, buy direct from the farmer at the farm or at farmers' markets, at the very least eat simpler and make as much as possible from scratch and fresh foods rather than buying prepackaged, highly processed foods.<br /><br />One point I would like to make about the chickens is that they are not ""forced"" to grow unnaturally fast as some reviewers say... they have been BRED to grow that way.  I grow the same chickens, Cornish Cross broilers, in my ""back yard"" (we have 10 acres).  Mine spend the first three weeks in the brooder til they are feathered out, and in addition to meat bird starter get hand pulled clover and grass with dirt and roots, as well as all the fine hay bits leftover from feeding other animals.  After moving to pasture pens I cut their high-powered Meat Grower feed with 25% plain scratch because in my first batch, before I cut the feed, I did have a few keel over from congestive heart failure from too-rapid growth.  They also get moved to fresh grass 2-3x daily.  No problems with the next two batches -- I ordered 75 chicks and was shipped 79 (a good hatchery always includes a few extras) in those batches and had only 3 die, and those within the first few days, weak ones/shipping stress.  I butchered from 6 to 8 weeks of age and while I did not weigh them, visually they were almost all larger than the storebought birds which are usually 3-1/2 to 4 lbs.  In fact some were Godzilla chickens, about 8-10 lbs!<br /><br />I love meat and will never be vegetarian unless I am forced to it.  Some people will take this movie as a call to vegetarianism.  I see it as a reason to buy your food direct from the farmer who grows it, one who allows you to visit the farm personally and see how it is raised.  ""Organic"" simply means the animal was fed organically-grown feed.  The animals can still be raised in terrible conditions and their meat labelled ""Organic"".  ""Cage Free"" and ""Free Range"" does not mean the birds are happily running around a pasture... it can mean there are still hundreds or thousands crowded at a square foot per bird into buildings, with all their food,water and shade inside so even if there is one small door to the ""free range"" outside they are likely not going to use it.<br /><br />I want to know how my meat was raised and how it died and was processed.  I am lucky in that I can raise and home butcher my own pork and chicken and buy my beef from a friend who raises her animals the same way I do.  Many cities are allowing folks within the city limits to keep chickens, so anyone can now keep their own for eggs or meat.  My own town has no regs against livestock at all and I know a man in the middle of town who raised a pig in his back yard last year.  He does have a large lot and kept the pen scrupulously clean so the neighbors would not have any complaints about smell.  Laying hens and meat birds make a lot less noise than your average dog.  Just don't keep any roosters to avoid annoying the neighbors (with meat birds sex doesn't matter, they are butchered long before they begin crowing).","Food, Inc"
112234,B002LBKDYE, A1WT6US1ZDWSTO,5.0, Watch It!,"My expectation of this film was that it would be more or less a compilation and reinforcement of information I had gleaned from having seen the eye-opening film ""Fast Food Nation"" several years ago, and having just finished reading the excellent books ""Animal,Vegetable Miracle"" and ""In Defense of Food"" among others. However, this film is more than the sum of those books and that movie.<br /><br /> Food Inc. is an extremely well made documentary in part because of the personal stories told by interviewees, as well as the hidden camera footage. I was especially impressed by what's happening to farmers.<br /><br />The material is so well investigate and presented. Multiple aspects of food production, marketing and consumption are covered. There is no ""time out"" in this movie, it's one hit after another. All shocking and important information we citizens need to be concerned about.<br /><br />Kudos to all involved in the making of this incredibly important film.

This movie is a must see.","Food, Inc"
112237,B002LBKDYE, A2I7SU4JXQ2HW1,5.0, A much needed education,"Very well done, macabrely entertaining documentary.  Food, Inc. kept me riveted as it explored all of the major corporate-power foods--poultry, beef, corn and soy.  Because this was my first exposure to MANY details about these industries, the information shocked, appalled and saddened me.  But this is just the wake-up call that our increasingly obese nation needs.  This is not a  ""conspiracy theory"" documentary, though I've heard it called this.  It is simply a documentary about the damage wrought on our food industry by big business supplying exactly what America demands--cheap, abundant food.<br />For anyone who watches this and leaves it feeling that no food available is fit to eat, I recommend reading (or listening on audio) to Barbara Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle.  She offers beautiful, encouraging advice about how we can start to make a difference, at least in our own bodies and communities, by growing and/or buying LOCAL, ORGANIC foods whenever possible--and she entertains marvelously while she makes her case.<br />And trust me, once you see Food, Inc., she won't have to sell the idea very hard.","Food, Inc"

Target, like WalMart, is now selling more and more organic food.  Not local food, as they need to be doing, but at least it is a step in the right direction.  I do not like WalMart, or its reasoning for why they are the largest buyer of organic food in the world (it was strictly a business decision, i.e. demand), but at least there is demand and WalMart, however horrible their employment practices and other business impacts, is at least ushering in what I hope will be an organic and local food revolution.<br /><br />Oh, and everyone from the millionaire to the family on welfare needs to be able to purchase it as well.  Right now we are telling the poor that because they cannot afford the more expensive organic and local food that they are not worthy of the benefits that come with eating that food.  We are setting them up for sickness.  That is not a world in which I want to live.  We can do better.  We must do better.","Food, Inc"

112241,B002LBKDYE, AOUV2YO60FTJ,5.0, Solidifying The Truth,"I grew up in a culture of very health-conscious church people, mostly vegetarians, and grew to learn about health very early in life.  However, coming into a fitness lifestyle also came with its demons, because most of these books, recipes, ways of ""replenishing"" the body also come with a lot of GMO's, lots of proteins from animal products, canned protein shakes, the new way to lose weight.  I would not have known to question any of these recommended fitness techniques had I been formerly encouraged by family and culture to ""eat vegetables to sweep the toxins away from your stomach.""  How much truer that statement is today.  I know that most people will say a documentary is one-sided, but it's probably because it just pulls its own weight.  Watch this movie and if it doesn't change the way you eat and view food, and become an active participant in advocating for the health of our future and our children's future, then you probably don't love yourself much.  And you ought to.<br /><br />Anyway, hard to change the polluted industry, but we can, one person at a time.  And if you need help with means to buy the better variety food, ask God for the means.

This documentary highlights the dangers of unregulated or underregulated businesses, how they are structured to act in the best interests of its shareholders, rather than its customers, and how government agencies are run by the same people who held (and ultimately return to) high-ranking positions in the same industry it is supposed to be regulating; like letting a fox guard the henhouse.  It's more than just poor working conditions and salaries for farmers and employees, poor living conditions for animals, and lax health and safety procedures.  It shows that many employees are exploited illegal immigrants that are actively recruited, hired, and brought from Latin America, only to be deported back with no legal repercussions for the corporations that brought them here, with full knowledge that they were not US citizens.<br /><br />It's another sad tale of how government is becoming increasingly controlled by private corporations that act only in the best interests of their shareholders; not the country at large, and how the apathy of so many have allowed it to happen.","Food, Inc"

I've always been an animal lover, I work with shelters, and of course have my own pets - but honestly, now that I KNOW what goes on, and have faced the truth, I will never eat meat again.

In fact, ""pretty-ing"" up and fattening up our food sources has consequences that reaches us at the cellular level and can cause health problems.  Not to mention tampering with seeds has created a world where seeds must one day become less varied and must ultimately be bought rather than gathered, and that's scary in the biblical sense.<br /><br />That said, the average city folk that watches this may get the impression that all dairies, all ranches, all chicken farms etc treat their animals inhumanely, that all animal farms are corrupt.  The average busy person is not going to meditate on the fact that this may be a select few companies or that it's big business. In fact, are all food corps this corrupt?  I really don't know, b/c I don't see w/ my naked eye whether there are corp farms that do run ethically.  But I do know that coming from a farming town where dairies are a big business  here, that these dairies and their cows are in plain sight.  I drive by them daily, I see them daily.  Heck, I can just stop my car and walk up to the fence if I wanted to.  I talk w/ the dairyman, I've spoken w/ chicken farmers, I've seen their chickens, our kids go on fieldtrips to these farms and get educated.  And what I see are very clean cows, clean dirt, clean food, and farmers that care very much about their investments.  I've NEVER seen a sick or obese cow wandering around, they are taken care of immediately, b/c they're valuable to the farmers.  Each cow cost money, and healthy cows make money.<br /><br />Please keep your mind open and realize that is film is not granite and not total reality.  It's one filmmaker's perpective.  Just b/c it's on film doesn't mean it applies to the vast majority of farms.","Food, Inc"

112264,B002LBKDYE, A3H6V59LAH6KQL,5.0, Our food is killing us,"Read my title of this review (as if you already didn't know).  Our food system is broken, there is no oversight, and food as we now know it isn't really food at all.  It's as if we are eating a ""notion"" of food and not the actual original God given morsel.  It's really really depressing watching this video.  This earth makes more than enough food to feed everyone organically well on this planet, yet, the large corporations are running our food system from seed to the supermarket and therefore control quality (or lack thereof) and pricing.  Wish we could all share what God intended for us to eat on this earth; his natural food in it's natural state.  Greed is the reason behind altering corn seeds/plants, implementing HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) in just about every product, steroids and hormones in meat, and other non-necessary chemical additives.<br /><br />I'm no vegetarian (although I'm thinking of becoming one) but just doesn't make sense to me why these huge corps pump chemicals into our food!  It makes me want to scream. Worse yet, taste an organic piece of fruit and then taste a pesticide sprayed chemically altered one and see which one tastes better.  The organic strawberry would win hands down.  Organic food isn't just good for you, it tastes better!<br /><br />Oh well, I'll step off of my ranting soap box, but, we must all make a change when buying food.  If we each bought one organic item everytime we shopped, maybe these corporations would have no choice but to compete for having the best organic food and produce.

One would think that this sort of irresponsible corporate behavior only happened in the 3rd world.  WRONG! This is happening right here in our backyard.  I am indeed surprised that Monsanto, Perdue and others have not silenced Eric Schlosser or managed to ban the DVD.<br /><br />It seems that human beings NEVER LEARN.  Throughout human history there have been numerous empires, a search in WIKI with the word ""List of empires"" will produce a huge list.  Each of them thought they will be around forever.  However, if someone in this century can name even five of those long gone empires, I would be impressed!  The point I am trying to make is that human greed that drives these sort of practices can never last.  Granted it will do a lot of damage until it is expunged, but its days are numbered.<br /><br />Ask any student in high school these days, if they have heard of IBM and you will probably get a blank look.  The same would be the case for General Dynamics and a host of other big behemoth corporations which have all been reduced to the status of ""Also ran!""  The point I am driving at is that longevity and artificially created monopolization do not mix well.  They may appear to be winning for a time, but in retrospect it is always for a short duration.<br /><br />I always maintain that we do not need an external power to destroy us, because we will destroy ourselves through greed!  What Al Qaeda was unable to do, namely dismantling the economy of this great nation, was almost suceesfully accomplished by the ""All American"" big corporations such as, Lehman Bros., AIG, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Citi Corp etc<br /><br />Likewise Monsanto, Perdue, Tyson, Con Agra, BPI, IBP, Smithfield and the others in the film, along with the Healthcare (Hospitals and Doctors) corporations will send everyone to an early grave through lots of suffering.  However, hopefully sooner rather than later, the public will wake up and cry, ""Enough!""<br /><br />This film must be shown 24/7 on cable networks, made available in schools, libraries, gym, etc.  Anyone who has children must make them watch this film so that they are made aware of the consequences of what they put into their mouths.<br /><br />For those who are open to advice from a stranger, I suggest that they clean out their colon, eat raw living foods (sprouts, green smoothies, wheatgrass juice, fruits, seeds, uncooked food etc) and do LOTS of yoga.  This is the way to a disease free life with minimum impact upon the environment and resources -- land and human suffering.  This will also help reduce the cost of health care tremendously.  Most importantly it will produce health and happiness in the lives of everyone who follows the advice.  Any  disease, manifested or gestating or seemingly incurable, will be healed.  This is my greatest learning in the 51 yrs I have been on this planet!  Please take action for your health while you still can.  Once you slip into the jaws of the mega corporations through eating the manipluated and poisoned food, or by being operated upon by the modern butchers of medicine (doctors), it may be too late to recover from a fate worse than death!<br /><br />Here is another DVD that I place in the same stellar league as this one.  The name is ""Healing Cancer"".  Even though the title implies that it deals with cancer alone, in reality the methods therein are generic enough to apply to all diseases -- chronic, degenerative and terminal.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016K3EMO"">Healing Cancer</a>","Food, Inc"

112274,B002LBKDYE, AMA491PELLKP7,3.0," Very disappointed. It's boring, selective, and has you filling in a lot of blanks.","Like the food industry, this movie falls short on presenting the science and statistics. There are several interesting sights, as well as some that will shock you pretty hard, but that's where the positives end.<br /><br />Many stories were so slow and had so much repeated scenery that the whole film could've been compressed down to 20 minutes, leaving plenty of time for more detail. The organic section was confusing and was unclear in presentation on position. The end points to each section of the film delivered in interest, only to give way to a new topic entirely. There were only a few statistics in the film, i.e., those related to premature diabetes and costs. Much of the science is left uncertain, i.e., high fructose corn syrup is brought up as a topic, but then left unassociated with the rest of the film.<br /><br />I was also frustrated to see ""Person XYZ declined an interview"" for every other person. Seriously, why the hell even include so many people if they wouldn't sit down with the producers? Go out there and find other people, and preferably people who can pop a story full of information. I feel like I paid my ticket for the show just to find out it's closed due to maintenance.<br /><br />Two of the movie scenes were really dumb. As for the 10-minute immigrant video in the style of ""COPS"" - are you kidding me? There has to be a better way of showcasing ""companies paying immigrants below minimum wage"" than spending 15% of the film on gun scenes like these. As for the other scene, the dollar menu family of four who can't afford to eat, seriously that was just pathetic. If you're fat and can't afford to eat/not enough time... swap for skim milk or eat less.<br /><br />Overall, the film feels like a string of loosely-connected partial interviews and hidden camera videos that have either a comical or sleepy feel, and sleepy in the not-detailed-enough sense. While the film showcases the evils of the food companies, this film has its own evil of selectively having you fill in the blanks... a lot of blanks. I have no idea what Eric Schlosser was thinking when he visioned an industry-changing 90-minute film, but I doubt this was it. Just save yourself and go read Fast Food Nation. You'll appreciate the details a lot more, especially since the first 20 minutes of the film are basically a compressed summary of two of the chapters.","Food, Inc"

112276,B002LBKDYE, AEML1DABWHF87,3.0, Unrealistic Expectations,"There are a lot of negative feelings I'm sure viewers associate with watching ""Food Inc."" I personally was left with feelings of impotence and hopelessness.<br />The final message, as so many documentaries are wont to do, states that ""you"" the consumer has the final say and the power to change the market. While this is of course true in theory and in essence, it does not always play out that way. I am more than likely to simply buy the cheapest available version of any product I desire or need. I want my grocery list to feed me for the longest time for the least amount of money, and that is that.<br />As a young person with a small amount of money at my disposal, that is my policy. It is tough to imagine so many other Americans who also only have a small amount of disposable income doing anything other than buying the cheapest product available.<br />This is not to say most Americans equipped with the knowledge supplied by the film wouldn't try and buy organically farmed products, it just means that most will not when it comes to saving money and feeding their families.<br />""Food Inc."" is extremely moving. But I can't say there is much I am willing to do to change the market given my current status. If I had more disposable income, as my parents do, I would certainly buy organically, and I believe most other concerned Americans would. If the government subsidized organic produce instead of protecting corporations like Mansanto, this would all be so much different. At the end of the day, Americans want it cheap and fast","Food, Inc"
112277,B002LBKDYE, A2FTHCGH06O4Y5,1.0, shoddily reasoned claptrap,"I enjoyed Eric Schlosser's book FAST FOOD NATION, so I thought I would enjoy this.  Wrong.  That book was coherent, entertaining, and reasonably well-argued.  This one jumps from point to point without giving time to contradictory viewpoints, or even acknowledging they exist.  I couldn't even get through the title sequence without yelling at the screen.<br /><br />These are not in any particular order:<br /><br />First of all, showing animals slaughtered is not an argument.  It never seems to occur to the filmmakers that many people are already aware that the animals they eat live short, awful lives in dark, cramped quarters -- and yet have no problem with it.  It was as though the mere sight of animals being butchered was going to be enough to put one off one's meat, but this is not the case for many people.<br /><br />Second:  the filmmakers look at data points only, not broad society-wide statistics.  The tale of the young boy dying from a freak outbreak of E. Coli was just that:  freak.  The movie made it seem like thousands and thousands are dying.  You're telling me that a billion-dollar industry needs to be shut down because of freak outbreaks now and then?<br /><br />Third:  never seems to occur to the filmmakers that the USDA might have some reasons for some of its requirements.  Take the prohibition against preparing meat in the open air.  It seems to me that one possible reason for this stricture might be, uh, flies and the effects of sunlight on raw meat.  But oh no!  The USDA is presented as a evil troll who hates sunlight and open air merely because it hates all joy and life.<br /><br />Fourth:  There was a boatload of irrelevant arguments thrown into this movie.  Am I supposed to feel guilty eating a cheeseburger because workers are forced to ""do the same task again and again""?  Sheesh.  Welcome to the modern world!  That's how things are on my job, which has nothing to do with food.  And what about this:  the way the food is manufactured, we are told, has implications for ""how corporations see other cultures.""  How is this relevant?  I don't care!  Corporations have always seen other cultures as resources to be exploited:  that's just in the nature of a corporation.  Even Apple, the darling company of liberals everywhere (bafflingly, to me), has no problem setting up grim factories in China, then selling the wares in shops in Riyadh.<br /><br />Fifth:  Does it ever occur to the filmmakers that if they got everything on their wish list, the population of the earth would have to decrease by a few billion?<br /><br />Sixth:  According to the filmmakers, if you are fat, that's not because you have no self-control:  it's because these evil conglomerates cleverly design food intended ""to press our evolutionary buttons.""  Thus, we're helpless!  Okay, let's take this reasoning over the area of women dressing.  Nearly every day I see women walking down the street in mini-skirts and high heels and think, boy, I'd like to hit that.  Why, the way she's dressing is pressing my ""evolutionary buttons.""  So does the responsibility lie with me to control my urges, or her . . . to veil?<br /><br />Seventh:  This film was the first I had ever heard of ""food libel laws.""  I did some looking into them, as the way the film characterized them struck me as fishy.  You can't criticize a cheeseburger in Colorado?  That didn't sound right.  No, what it turns out to be is you can't make unsubstantiated claims about food being harmful and cause food industries and workers millions of dollars unless you can substantiate your claims.  If you can, though, it sure as shootin' is legal.  What you can't do is simply fire off wacky, unprovable accusations and send everybody into a panic.  In this way, the food libel laws, where they exist, are similar to libel laws against humans:  you ARE CERTAINLY ALLOWED TO SAY NEGATIVE THINGS in a public forum as long as they are a matter of public record or can be backed up.  The filmmakers absurdly moaning that ""you can't criticize food"" is misleading:  they are deliberately conflating the idea of CRITICISM with UNFOUNDED ASSERTIONS.  Many, since the establishment of food libel laws, have since pointed out all sorts of stuff about what's in the food we eat without getting into hot water BECAUSE THEY WERE ABLE TO BACK UP THEIR CLAIMS.  That lady interviewed on screen obviously couldn't, so, without knowing much more about her situation, I can only assume it was a good thing that she was gagged.  There's more, though:  the ""food libel laws,"" whether just or injust, must be a good deal weaker than the filmmakers characterization of them.  After all, this very film was replete with unsubstantiated accusations and yet I actually bought this DVD in Colorado.<br /><br />Having said all this, I do agree with some of the some of the movie's points:  agricultural subsidies are a cancer on the economy and yes, our food is too cheap and its price needs to rise so that the full social cost of living as we do can be clearly apprehended.  But when it comes to those points, I came to be convinced of them from reading other sources, not from seeing the arguments in this film.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be great if the DVD makers were forced to release this film with a commentary track with a couple of tech guys from the USDA responding to what you're seeing on the screen?","Food, Inc"

Is not that just a little unsettled? Theese chickens are starving w/ diseases and since they are so big they can not even hold there own wait to strole down to the pub for a bight. And then Kevin ate 3 ham bugars (intresting that it is called a HAM burgar, no?) that contained infected corn from infected cows and he was dead in 12 days! But that 12 days did not go without its unbenefits, he had a condition where he could only afford water from a small sponge for he begged for water and he ate upon that very sponge.<br /><br />Our govt has been making handshakes with this corporations now. The USDNA & FDA turn one other blind eye to this scam of hurting us. We waste land for our greed. Corn. Animals = money = no humanity. Did you realize that workers were once african american, but are now undocumented workers? These crooked swines (swine flu?

I was sorely disappointed.  The film is biased, when it needn't be, incomplete and poorly executed.  For example, we see the grass farmer slaughtering his chickens, but in the Ominivore's Dilemma, this grass farmer is much more that someone who raises grass-fed chickens.  He raises an entire eco-system, one that should be discussed and promoted.  He also raises cattle and pigs, but his prohibited from slaughtering those animals on his farm.  This is never mentioned.  His story and the way that he farms is so much more interesting than the entire Food, Inc. film.  In so many scenes, I was saying to myself, ""Yes, but . . . ""  Yes, but that thought is incomplete, yes, but you could say so much more, yes, but what about this fact or that fact.  Essentially, Food, Inc. is lazy and superficial in fact and form; it is the People Magazine version of the Omnivore's Dilemma.  It will turn off people who it is meant to appeal to and others will simple render it a poorly done polemic.  A much better film is ""The Future of Food"".","Food, Inc"

I find their particular lot in this largely their own fault.  Racial connotations aside, your time, and theirs, are one's own responsibility.  No one but one's self dictates how one's time is spent.  If one chooses convenience, over some degree of responsibility, he or she no longer truly has the right to ""bitch"" about it.  ""No time to cook"" implies a degree of neglect of one's children.  If this occurs regularly, then that person officially is trash.  Over $200 in medication, counterbalanced by an informed diet really only implies a large degree of responsibility lacking.<br />  We know the governments the world over have failed in the stewardship of their people. Well, cry about it, or take action?  A legitimate question, considering the loudest protestors rarely are accountable for the plight they decry (thus their noise serves only to agitate the cattle, instead of spending money on feeding the masses what they feel is proper).  It's a simple thing, complaining, and lamenting.  But at the end of the day, it's all our fault.  All legislature allows room for interpretation. And all therefor are allowed by us, the majority.  Big money means nothing if a retail vendor chooses not to accept some currency or another.<br />  You are to blame for the acts shown in this film.  You are to blame for your poor health, and all political failings. You are the devil you denounce.  You are the evil politician.  Because you would rather discuss it, or complain, instead of banding together with like-minded folk, and acting.  One such crowd though, will act so foolishly, and lack so much wisdom, they are little better than the poor treated so-and-so that they would support- while sitting in front of a T.V., and buying ANYTHING advertised. You are more suitable for food than the cows.  Which sadly (for all of us) seem somehow more possessed with logic than man.  I hope your cancer is as brutal as the complaints you lodge on others.

Big companies can lobby government to get rules written and subsidies for their products. Stop subsidizing corn production and stop diverting corn to make ethanol.<br /><br />If corporate managers and directors at competing companies are not accountable when they have to keep their customers from migrating to non-industrial farming, what makes the film makers or their on-screen speakers think that the USDA can do a better job if there were just more laws?","Food, Inc"

When contacted by phone and told that we would like to show this film to some club members, (around 20), in the rear room of a nearby coffee shop our Agriculture Club was told that it would cost us $150 and require purchase of the film directly from their company.

Balancing food quantity, quality, and safety is no doubt a delicate balancing act that has global hunger implications -- I only wish this film covered more of that topic instead of simply slamming the food industry. Our food supply may not be perfect, but let's face it; it is the best in the world by a large margin.

However, we both agreed afterwards that the movie was actually pretty boring. It just didn't have that ""pop"" that I expect from a good documentary. I wasn't horrified by the conditions in the various slaughterhouses, I wasn't surprised that a big company like Monsanto would find a way to protect their intellectual property rights, I wasn't surprised that corn is in a lot of foods. What I was surprised by, though, was that the insane and environmentally INCORRECT use of corn to make ethanol wasn't even brought up when they talked about corn. Why wasn't that even mentioned? Using corn to make ethanol has raised the price of food, is worse for the environment than just plain gas when a spill occurs, and in the long run does more harm than good to our environment.<br /><br />I also have the book and am hoping that the book is better than the movie. I expected that after seeing this, I'd want to change my eating habits, but it didn't have that effect on me at all. maybe the book will.<br /><br />Something else that was strange was that they seemed to play down the fact that e. coli comes from human and animal excrement.<br /><br />If I were giving the movie a letter grade, it would be a C-minus.","Food, Inc"

They say that they gave corporations opportunities for their input but I seriously doubt it given the effort this movie makes to purposely make them look bad.<br />  Probably one of the most telling parts of this movie is the chicken farmer that ended up losing her contract with the food industry. They paint her as a victim of the food industry's greed but the first thing I noticed when they showed her chicken barns where the lack of air circulation. She didn't have fans keeping the chickens cool and they were dying because of it. They showed some dead but I would bet that more chickens died on the way to the ""Big Five"" due to the additional stress of being loaded and shipped. The corporations can't have farmers delivering to them dead stock. But this movie made little mention of this but instead focused its attention on her plight and the ""bad"" corporations who put her in this situation, only there are numerous other chicken farmers who were making money.<br />  These type of people who produce these movies always look for victims and exploit them. They will put little or no weight on the victim possibly being responsible for their position. When you see this, take the entire movie with a giant grain of salt. They have an agenda and don't care what the truth is. No wonder the corporate bosses wanted nothing to do with this hit piece.<br />  Its so sad that our young generation is so suseptible to this kind of propaganda. They make sure that the one side is painted as evil while the other side victims. They make sure that the evil side is faceless and not human. They make certain that their viewpoint cannot be countered.<br />  There is some knowledge to be learned in this movie but the overall theme is just garbage. No corporate boss wants to put contaminated or questionable food into the market. There is no way they could know that it wouldn't come back to their family or friends. They have a HUGE interest in making the food they put into the market the safest and best product they can make.","Food, Inc"

Cattle naturally were grass eaters yes but why assume corn does not serve man's modern needs. Man was created to walk or run do we give up driving, flying, riding bicycles etc..etc..I thought. Individually I might consider organic for better health but can appreciate our need for these process efficencies.<br />I thought the scene with the field  processing of organic small farm chickens especially funny.

112305,B002LBKDYE, A2RGEZZYSM48TK,2.0, One-sided propaganda...but somewhat informative,"From the preview, I thought this film was going to be a bit more encompassing, since ""documentary"" somewhat implies an objective and fairminded analysis.  However, this was mostly a one-sided (from the liberal perspective) demonization of the timeworn target, the ""large multinational corporation"".  That's not to say the ""one side"" doesn't have a few good points, such as the excessive heavy-handedness of a few big companies in their attempt to legally bully the smaller, independent agricultural farmer or worker.<br /><br />  Where the movie got somewhat off track, however, was with the myopic viewpoint that all non-organic large-scale consolidation and mechanization of the agricultural/food industry is evil and contrary to the well-being of our planet and its citizens.  In fact, the mass production techniques in effect today, as well as genetic food engineering, are primarily responsible for allowing smaller parcels of arable land to feed ever-increasing world populations -- and the paramount reasons that the USA has become the world's breadbasket in times of peace and catastrophe (do you see any other countries shipping huge amounts of foodstuffs to the recent Haitian disaster sites?).<br /><br />To cast a pall of Maximum Evil onto the large food producers, the film made liberal use (no pun intended) of the mechanism of scrolling "">>>insert food corporation's name here&lt;&lt;&lt; DECLINED TO BE INTERVIEWED FOR THIS FILM"" past your view screen. Although a somewhat passe technique, if they truly wanted to include a voice from the ""other side"", the producers COULD have obtained the countervailing viewpoints from the established industry spokespersons -- such as the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the US Poultry & Egg Association, etc.<br /><br />  And of course, no left-slanting film would be complete without your hearing the mantra of ""global warming"" a time or two -- despite that concept becoming more laughable with every passing day as newer, more accurate revelations leak out from the true scientific community (those not yet corrupted by ""climate politics"" and its money-driven propaganda machine).  I guess the producers didn't get the memo yet: they're now supposed to call it ""climate change"", since the phrase ""global warming"" no longer even passes the giggle test.<br /><br />  All in all though, this film was (barely) worth the .99 cent weekend rental price -- that is, if you haven't explored this subject matter previously.  Otherwise, the film is far too weak on content -- no matter which side you're on -- to be a ""buy"".","Food, Inc"

Like any true propaganda film, facts are mixed with inaccuracies and incomplete information, so that the viewer is left with a wrong impression of reality, or an unstated blatant lie.<br /><br />An example of incomplete information is the treatment of corn, and how it's used by Big Bad Businesses. The movie presents corn as the source of American obesity, without regard to the countless studies that show that primary causes for obesity are a dramatic increase in caloric intake and lack of exercise. The standard applied to causality between corn and obesity is such that one could equally well say that spoons are the cause for obesity in America.<br /><br />Strangely the ""documentary"" has no actual scientific experts offering opinions, perhaps because such interviews were not deemed necessary, or their content ran contrary to whatever agenda the producers have.<br /><br />One underlying tone is that Big Bad Corporations are out to get the farmer and the consumer, and that they are enabled by Bad Evil People, such as anyone appointed by President GW Bush. The producers don't seem to find it inconvenient to gloss over the fact that agricultural policies and the Big Bad Corporations depicted go back decades, not just the 8 years from 2001 to 2008, and that appointees of Presidents Clinton and Carter are of necessity engaging in the same Bad Evil activities.<br /><br />In short, save your money and time, unless you like your blinders firmly planted right where they are.","Food, Inc"

Yes, food contamination, unhealthiness, and conglomeration is depressing. But, has it already been covered? Yes.<br /><br />Most of the content in the movie has already been reported by Schlosser. If you have read Fast Food Nation, there is not much need to watch this movie. Talk on fast food restaurants? Check. The link between obesity and unhealthy food? Check. Slaughterhouses and migrant workers? Check.<br /><br />A lot of the movie topics have been covered by other documentaries, such as King Corn and Super Size Me. The parts that haven't appeared in other documentaries, such as the death of a young child who ate at Jack in the Box, make up a small minority of the film. There are countless scenes of farmers complaining about the meat packaging and farming system on their farms, which, while interesting, are drawn out to the point that they turn repetitive.<br /><br />Overall, if you have read Fast Food Nation and loosely keep up with current events, there is not much need for you to watch this film that tells you so much of what you already know.

What this accomplishes is to produce a lot of food in a small amount of space at a very affordable price.  Let somebody explain to me what's wrong with that.""  Well, this film does explain very well what's wrong with that.<br /><br />The first point is that it is no good to treat animals as if they were mere *objects*.  You'll see chickens and beef up to their knees in their own droppings.  You'll also see chickens in their cages, not being able to carry even their own weight.  The animals are kept all the time in the dark, including for us.  It was very hard for the movie makers to obtain some footage from inside those chicken houses.<br /><br />The second point, linked in a way to the preceding one, is that our food can easily become contaminated with E-coli, due to the droppings the animals carry on their skin.  That's how food poisoning can occur in the slaughterhouse.<br /><br />Barbara Kowalcyk, mother of a 2.5 old year kid, lived through the most horrible experience anybody can suffer : the death of her child...  The reason : eating a ... hamburger...  ""We put faith in our government to be protected, but we're not being protected at the most basic level"", she says.  This is not an inconvenient truth - although this movie was produced by the same company that brought us the documentary with the same title.  This is an ugly truth.<br /><br />Can we do something about it ?  Absolutely.  ""You can change the world, with every bite"".  Switch to organics.  Even better would be to connect yourself again with the source of your food, of what you are eating, of what you are putting in your mouth !

It featured Michael Pollan, one of my favorite modern investigative writers in the general health field. You might have heard of some of his books... The Omnivore's Dilemma and In Defense of Food. He seems pretty objective and level-headed.<br /><br />Food, Inc. wasn't really a vegetarian or vegan windfall, because it didn't come down especially hard on the eating of meat. It was hard on GMO products / labeling / patenting / subsidizing and the problems associated with large-scale meat production with the attendant medications and the revolting living conditions.<br /><br />Many points were made, such as that cows aren't supposed to eat corn, and studies show a massive increase of E.Coli in their systems when they are fed it.

It gives you tools and information about what people can do to get involved and make changes in their own lives and possibly become activists for changes in the United States Food Industry. If you are looking at your plate and you don't care where your food came from out of fear, this is your movie. My husband and I overhauled our whole diet because of this movie. We buy all our meat from a local farm that delivers to our city's farmers market and we joined a vegetable and fruit co-op. We pay a yearly fee and pick-up our share of local farm organic, not genetically engineered produce every other week. We don't eat any GMO corn, GMO soybean/soybean oil products, GMO SugarBeets,GMO eggplant, or GE franken-fish salmon!<br />The only topic I was seriously disappointed that FOOD Inc. did not expose was the factory farming dairy industry, so I will touch on it. In this bazarre and age old practice, cows are abusively artificially inseminated, to keep them perpetually pregnant, so that they can produce milk and milk by-products {yogurt, cheese, butter, ice cream} and the by-product of the cruel dairy industry is the bull dairy calf who has no economic value to the farmer. [Nope, I am not VEGAN] They are pulled from the mother cow at birth and this unweaned animal is sold for ""bob veal"", ""pink veal"" or ""white veal"".  Cows are like women. They can only produce milk if they are giving birth. Does that sound organic to you? If you enjoy dairy, look out for the leukemia virus, paratuberculosis, Salmonella, E. Coli, staphylococcal infections, juvenile diabetes, pus & blood. If you want to take your chance on all of that stuff, how about Monsanto's Bovine Growth Hormone that the FDA claims is safe for human consumption. Canada and Europe don't agree and they will not allow USA dairy products to be exported to thier countries. Doesn't this sound like our FDA, big business, and advertisers to promote a product to you like ""milk it does a body good"" when in all actuality this most bizarre practice is disease ridden and detimental to your health?

Oh it tasted fine, and it was really tender - THAT'S how I knew something wasn't right.  But since US labeling laws do not require meat packers to mention its use, I will never know for sure.  Ever since that day I have decided to know more about where our food comes from.  We rely more & more on our own garden & raise chickens.  I buy organic and unprocessed whenever possible.

If 1000 scientist, after examining the facts, say something is clearly true, and you find one who says it isn't, then giving that one scientist equal press time, misrepresents the facts.<br /><br />Besides, the ""good"" was represented... lots of food can be produced quickly. The rest of the movie showed you at what cost.<br /><br />Saying it didn't give a equal voice to the food industry, makes me believe you didn't watch the movie.

The voices in the movie were excellent (even Owen Wilson...whom I don't normally like).<br /><br />The bluray was pretty cool but I was getting the feeling like it was almost too pristine.

Yes I am 38 and still watch cartoons. :p<br /><br />Update... even after going through over 100HD movies it is still one of the best.

The plot is convincing (except for the talking cars) as it approaches the modern life in detriment of slow-paced and honest small town America.<br /><br />The movie also approaches the value of having true friends around you and shows that helping others in their most difficult moments gives a sense of self-fulfillment and that no money or glory can ever replace.<br /><br />Entertainment guaranteed or your money back.

So as Mac (McQueen's truck) is driving him to the race he falls asleep and McQueen goes out.

From the story line to the voiceovers to the exquisitely fine details (including the in-jokes) of the animation, CARS is a flat-out winner, and only NASCAR fanatics (of which I am not one) could possibly care that some racing rules are conveniently ignored here and there.<br /><br />I am SO glad that the animators didn't stop at the stiffer, more photo-realistic level of animation we saw in an early trailer; ""humanizing"" the cars by giving them the facial and body expressions required comprise just the touch that was needed. Most stunning to me was the near-photo-realistic animation of the mountains, trees and waterfalls in a high pass (which actually made Pixar's rendering farm crash at first) -- it's so breathtaking that it really needs widescreen formatting to do it justice.<br /><br />After I saw it in the theater, I exclaimed, ""I may never look at a car in the same way again!""

The funny cars I like are Mater because of all the stuff he says like when he is saying his name he says ""my name is mater like Tamater but without the Ta"". If Lightning would of got tires he would of won and would be the first ever rookie to win the Piston cup But when he's on the last turn he blows two tires. Then no one knows how won. And the King goes up to Lightning and said ""he's a gutsy racer but you're stupid"". Then the King says ""get you a good crew chief and then you will be good"". And then they say for the first time ever lightning says a rookie has won then he jumps through the paper. Then the announcer says there is a three way tie then on the way to California. DJ, WINGO, SNOT ROD, and BOOST started pushing Mac and Lightning falls out of the back of the truck. And he ends up in Radiator Springs. He was speeding and the Sheriff was going so fast Lightning thought that the Sheriff was shooting at him. So Lightning started going faster and when he got into the town he tour up the rode. So he had to fix the road with Beshy. And mater said ""I would give two lug nuts to be with Beshy. Then he went really fast and the road was a lot worse so he had to do it again and that time he finished it. Then he found out that the judge was the Hudson Hornet. And then he tells Mater that he won 4 Piston cups and then Mater says ""he did what in his cup"". Lightning makes the Hudson Hornet mad so he calls somebody and tells him where Lightning is. So he was racing and was losing bad but then he hears all the people from Radiator Springs. And then he starts to win and Chick makes The King crash so lightning goes and helps The King cross the finish line. Then the Dinoco  manger over and asks Lightning if he wants anything and he says yes and Mater gets to ride in a helicopter and Radiator springs is put back on the map.

Little Lightning McQueen (better known as ""Stickers"" by his love interest due to the sponsor ship logos all over him) is a hotshot race car who becomes lost and stuck in a small po-dunk town somewhere in the Southwest Desert (New Mexico? Arizona? Who knows...). He has to learn humility and what selflessness really is before he can get back on track (yeah, yeah pun intended).<br /><br />The movie's cute. Yes, cute. I know I cringe when I hear my Creative Writing students use this word about someone's work. All of the hype of the year was worth it for this one, and I know I've not see Happy Feet or Haunted House, but it's Pixar AND Disney. How can it lose next month? Best Animated is usually a shoo-in, but I'll hold that card until after Happy Feet whose reviews definitely aren't as good. I even cried during Cars when the older race car is shoved off the track and wrecks. Oh my! An Oscar contender makes me a shed a tear. Good job, Lasseter.",Cars
808959,B000H7I6CU, A3GJW7DVGBVX2O,5.0," First look...not that great, but a second look...WOW, what a movie!","I have to admit when I first saw this movie and it came out I didn't get it.  I didn't like it either, for some reason it just didn't fit my tastes.  Yeah it was cute and everything, but it didn't grab my attention.  Maybe because I wasn't really interested in it at the time.<br /><br />Once my first child became two years old, she was really into Cars (not per se the movie but the actual cars like Hot Wheels) and well I was looking for something for her to watch on a movie in the dvd player in the van.  I came across Cars the movie once again.  Boy did she love it!  This is the only movie that my daughter can watch about 3-4 times and beg for more of and I have grown to love this movie too.<br /><br />The animation of this movie is outstanding, far surpasses a lot of what pixar has done and makes me feel like driving through Arizona sometime soon just to see it in person.  The storyline is funny and the characters are funning and loving.  The message that the movie sends is very heartwarming in which a car finds who he really is.  The music goes great with the movie and one thing that I really love about the movie is every time you watch it, you see something you didn't before.  Something that Pixar put that you didn't notice until you saw it a little bit closer.<br /><br />For example, Sally hits Luigi when she is talking to Mcqueen, there are tire tracks in the sky when they are racing in the dirt, etc...it's neat to see how they put hidden stuff in there like that.<br /><br />If you saw this movie once and didn't like it, I recommend to watch it again and see for yourself.  I love it now and sit down with my daughter when she watches it.  It's one of Pixars best and I wish they would make another one, but they don't like to do sequels.",Cars

All you have is a selfish young car that learns to love others and to value people and friendships.  He learns this from ""normal"" everyday cars that care about each other and come to care about him.  The show just makes you feel good about what you can do to be a good friend.

808972,B000H7I6CU, AE7WX7VY993TE,5.0, Now *THIS* is how high-definition should look!,"When I first heard about Cars, I didn't think much of it. I always loved Pixar's movies but I couldn't really see what they were trying to accomplish with a movie where there wasn't a single humanoid to be found anywhere. Plus, I thought another ""talking cars"" property would be as stupid as all the other ones. I didn't see or read much about the movie in the months leading to its release in theaters and so didn't have a whole lot of reason to expect a lot from the movie, which I was going to see almost out of duty (both because my younger cousins were in town and because it was a Pixar film).<br /><br />After the credits rolled, I knew I had just watched my second favorite Pixar film and one of my top 10 Disney films of all time. I still like Finding Nemo the best because it has a more emotional and universal moral component to it. I also happen to think that Ratatouille is a better ""film"" in general but I had a LOT more fun watching Cars. Like with Finding Nemo, I can watch this movie over and over again and not get tired of it. It may have to do with the inner child in me - my young nephew can't get enough of Cars and Finding Nemo but isn't nearly as impressed with The Incredibles and Ratatouille, two films my wife and friends like more.<br /><br />I liken Cars to Shrek in the sense that there's always something interesting going on in the background if you care to look past the core of what's happening. The world in which Lightning McQueen and Mater live is cleverly designed to be almost exactly like ours would be if there all organic life forms were replaced with motorized vehicles. Even many parts of the landscape are shaped like vehicles in much the same way we sometimes think that a mountain or tree kind of looks like the side of someone's face. And many aspects of the world are dealt with in the clever manner we've come to expect from the geniuses at Pixar - insects are VW Beetles, Lighting McQueen's two biggest fans love to flash their headlights (quite literally, for those of you with your mind in the gutter) and the racing commentators are named Bob Cutlass and Darryl Cartrip.<br /><br />While the general premise of the story is nothing new and fairly basic - a hot shot rookie race car concerned only with himself ends up in a long forgotten midwest town where the locals help him learn to enjoy life and care about something greater than oneself - the movie is immensely fun to watch, thanks mostly to the personality quirks of the citizens (specifically a run down tow truck with a good soul) of Radiator Springs, ""the cutest little town in Carburetor County."" It's always a joy to watch McQueen discover that there's more to life than fame and money.<br /><br />If the movie being great wasn't enough, this particular Blu-Ray disc also boasts the hands-down best video quality I've seen in any high-definition disc. This is the first movie I've seen where I can say that if you haven't seen it in high-definition, you haven't seen it at all. CGI movies tend to have really impressive transfers because the studios can use masters stored digitally instead of on film, but Cars outshines all others... and it's not a photo finish by a long shot. There are tons of little details that I didn't even see when I saw it on the big screen a year and a half ago. One perfect example is Lightning McQueen's paint job. Before I watched the Blu-Ray disc last night (Christmas Day), I didn't know that there were all these little sparkles in the paint similar to the ""jewel"" or ""pearl"" type colors you see for new car models these days (if you've seen the red 2008 Saturn Outlook, you'll know what I mean). My jaw simply dropped when I noticed that because it was just a completel revelation to me, all thanks to Blu-Ray (and my television is just 1080i).<br /><br />Another impressive thing about this disc is the ""Car Finder"" interactive movie game, a first of this kind on any home movie format. When you play this game, a special little heads-up graphical user interface comes on over the movie which shows your score, what cars to look for and how many you've missed so far. The premise of the game is that you basically keep an eye out for specific cars shown at the bottom of the screen. If you see one in any particular scene of the movie, you hit an action button on your remote control and a new car to look for pops up in its place. Even better, every car you find is added to a huge showcase gallery that has a close-up image of the car, the scene in which the car appeared and an audio background biography of the character (you can now find out what the actual name of the Apple-sponsored car in the opening Dinoco 400 race is). The only annoying aspect is that the normal controls for the movie (pause, stop, skip, etc.) are disabled - the only way to get out of the movie is to hit the ""Pop-up Menu"" button.<br /><br />All in all, this is hands-down the best and most impressive high-definition release so far (this is coming from a staunch HD-DVD supporter). I cannot recommend this movie highly enough unless you either just didn't like this movie or aren't a fan of ""kids'"" movies in the first place. Otherwise, if you own a Blu-Ray player, do yourself a service and purchase Cars today... or even better, buy a Blu-Ray player to enjoy this movie in a whole new way!",Cars

808981,B000H7I6CU, A21N3R2YK3XXQG,4.0, Another Great Pixar Flick,"Pixar has a knack for churning out movies that are great for kids, but also amusing enough that adults can enjoy them too.  Cars is another great example of this.<br /><br />As well, I recommend that you check out the special features and the mini documentary on Route 66.  Fascinating tale of a bygone era that inspired a lot of the art of the movie.",Cars
808982,B000H7I6CU, A39CX0EE4BZCZC,5.0, Can't Say Enough Good Things About This Animated Gem,"Wow, this was fantastic! As I was watching it, I asked myself, ""Is this the best animated movie I've ever seen?' I think the answer is ""yes,"" at least at the time I viewed this.<br /><br />After watching ""The Polar Express"" last year and seeing the most beautiful visuals and fabulous sound, I thought it might be awhile before anything topped that, but this movie beats it. That's because it's equally beautiful, color-wise, and more entertaining because of the excellent humor. The humor isn't just a bunch of funny lines; it's also funny sights on screen from the cars' ""faces"" to a lot of clever material in the background. There is so much to see that multiple viewings, I'm sure, would catch new things each time.<br /><br /> The characters are varied and the kind you care about, or want to find out more about, all of which translates into scenes which continually keep your interest.<br /><br />The message is a nice one, too, and not delivered in any heavy-handed manner, either. Having a team to work with, people to be there to help and be helped, is better than going alone in life. Thy didn't beat us to death with it, but that is the unmistakable message in this story.<br /><br />As a final note: don't turn this off when it's over; stay with the ending credits because there are some really funny comments, mostly by John Ratzenberger .",Cars

However, when I saw *Cars* it wasn't so bad.<br /><br />When Lightning McQueen ties with 2 other cars in a racing competition, they must re-race at another location in California.  Overnight, while sleeping in a semi-truck, McQueen is lost in the middle of nowhere.  Not only is he lost but he's in trouble for damaging a road strip and is sentenced to repair the road.<br /><br />Trapped and angry about his potential loss of a championship and sponsorship, he soons learns that there's more to life than winning the cup.  He meets other cars and befriends them as well as getting interested with one of them.  Meanwhile, he discovers there's someone there that used to be a racer but has kept it a secret.<br /><br />Regardless of his friendship with everyone, McQueen still has to repair the road.  When he is done, he has to decide which is more important...the race or his new friends.<br /><br />Pixar still hasn't failed me.  Even though I'm not fond of car racing, *Cars* was still an entertaining watch.",Cars

At first, the idea of cars talking was a little off-putting to me; but if you can accept the idea that cars can be animated, taking the place of people and all other living creatures in their world, then you can appreciate the hilarity of the jokes, double-entendres, and the universality of a story about a young punk ""kid"" who learns how to grow up and slow down, while at the same time bringing an old ""man"" out of hermitage and hiding. This is a story of growth and change, with a good dose of innocent comedy (supplied by the character Mater, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) a touch of romance, and a bit of history. Non-Nascar fanatics like myself can still appreciate this new notch in Pixar's belt. Highly recommended.",Cars

The homage to lost Americana and 'the Mother Road', Route 66 is just icing on the cake, it makes a great thing even better.<br /><br />'CARS' is a worthy addition to the home DVD collection and I recommend it without reservation.

It also makes you feel good and has a great message of how friends come in all shapes in sizes and no matter where you are in life true friends will always be there for you.  That's what Cars is about.  It's about slowing down every now and then from our fast-paced, rushed world and really look at the important things in life and how beautiful life can be.  It's comical and heart-warming.  My favorite character is Mater, the old, rusted tow truck from Radiator Springs.  He is instantly likeable, with his cheerful demeanor, and comical way of life; a character that sees the good and fun in everything and everyone.  Pixar has always done great with their films and this film is especially great.  Two thumbs up for me. I recommend it to everyone.",Cars

All of the Route 66 and NASCAR elements made this a movie I can watch many times, as I always notice something that I missed during previous viewings.

809010,B000H7I6CU, A25MZ7A5A4I6Z5,5.0, Amazing animation,"This should have gotten the Oscar.  It is head-and-shoulders above _Happy Feet_ in all respects: The animation is better, the storyline is vastly better, and it's much less crude.  However, unlike _Happy Feet_, it's not a movie that does all the entertaining for you with cheap laughs; you have to pay attention.<br /><br />I must confess that I thought the story line needed a bit of editing (was not as well-paced as the Toy Story movies), but it wasn't glaring.  The other downside is that this is not really a kids' movie.  The action is much too fast and the bulk of the humor is in cultural references and comparatively sophisticated sight gags, most of which will go right over the heads of children (and, I guess, of some adults, hence the criticism that it is ""tedious"").  It's an extraordinarily clever movie and can be watched several times before one catches all the little gags.<br /><br />On the up side:<br />1) It lacks most of the toilet humor and thinly-disguised sexual references to which Disney seems to be resorting more and more.<br />2) The animation is mind-boggling.  Some of the scenery doesn't even look like animation, and the nuances of automotive movement (shaking smokestacks, etc.) are dead-on.  Makes _Happy Feet_ look mediocre and _Toy Story_ look like stick figures.  Absolutely a visually gorgeous movie.<br />3) The story line, while a bit uneven, is still better than the vast majority of animated features.<br />4) For those old enough to ""get"" them, the celebrity cameos, identifiable cars, historical references, and Americana references are priceless.  Click and Clack from NPR's ""Car Talk"" are not to be missed as the Rust-Eze guys.",Cars

The CG is so real that one can't tell the difference between the real thing in some of the scenes.<br /><br />What fascinates me is the last hour when McQueen (Owen Wilson) reached Radiator Springs and bonded with the local folk. The scene is breathtaking, the story of the former glory well captured and things got interesting when Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) started to flex his muscles. All these made the final race in California more sentimental and much anticipated than ever. The message is clear, whether it will be heeded is another matter, but it is very worth telling.",Cars

We went to see it in the theater and could not wait until it came out on DVD.  My son even asked for it to be his birthday party theme and he never does TV themes.  I have read several of the reviews that people have posted on here and would have to say that I am a little concerned about the people who have a problem with the movie's language.  I do not think that it is any different then any other children's movie and a lot better then what my son comes home with from school and he is in kindergarten.  I would recommend this move to car and non car lovers alike.  A great movie sure to become a classic!",Cars
809014,B000H7I6CU, A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,4.0, Heart-Warming,"""Cars"" was an entertaining animated feature.  The story line about a racecar that is stranded in Radiator Springs was well written.  The moral of the story that you have to have good friends to make life worth living is one that kids everywhere can relate to.  Owen Wilson's voice is so good as Lightning McQueen that you actually feel like it's a living character.  As big a fan as I am of Bonnie Hunt, I actually didn't realize it was her voice as Sally the Porche until afterwards.  Paul Newman does an excellent job as the former Piston Cup winner Doc Hudson who has now retired to the small town after surviving a major accident and being unable to get sponsorship to get back in the races.

I liked the movie for the cultivation of a hero.  There weren't many (obviously) kissy-face scenes that my nine year old would pronounce *GROSSSS*, but the sweet sentiments were still there.

Great story/script, sophisticated dialogue, and voices from some of the best actors in the business.<br /><br />Just like ""Toy Story,"" this Pixar masterpiece is a blast for both kids and old geezers (I actually owned a 1949 Mercury long ago) but also captures America's popular history, in this case our complex love-affair with highways and wheels. Note that all this is on top of some of the best digital-animation & artwork in the history of movies. Ka-chow!

809017,B000H7I6CU, AY12DBB0U420B,4.0, Amusing and somewhat touching.,"I kept hearing about the movie ""Cars,"" but somehow I never got around to seeing it. Then lately, I stumbled upon the DVD and purchased it on the advice of my companion. We watched it a couple evenings later. It's an amusing and somewhat touching movie. Dumb, perhaps, but amusing.<br /><br />The story involves Lightning McQueen, an ambitious rookie racecar who unexpectedly finds himself marooned in the old Route 66 Arizona town of Radiator Springs. McQueen was on route to the big Piston Cup Championship in California where he was to compete against two pros with whom he'd tied in a previous race.<br /><br />In Radiator Springs, McQueen gets in trouble with the law and has to do community service repairing the street. As such, he gets to know Some of the town's characters. Sally, a 2002 Porsche, becomes his lady friend. Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet, gradually reveals he was a previous three-time Piston Cup winner. Mater, a beat up but trusty tow truck, helps him realize that there are other things just as important as racing. McQueen eventually goes on to compete in the Piston Cup, where he could have won.<br /><br />It's an amusing story, well told. There are chuckles here and there. The depictions of the cars and the setting of Radiator Springs are interesting. In places, the movie is touching. It'll probably pick up a few awards, but I wouldn't rank it with the best animations.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",Cars

It's a daily request and excellent tantrum causer when denied. We and our relatives have also contributed to the run on fossil fuels by accumulating multiple Cars license toys to go with my son's infatuation with the film.

809021,B000H7I6CU, A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,4.0, Cars Sets a Pace,"Rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson of ""Rushmore,"" ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Behind Enemy Lines"" fame) finished the Piston Cup in a three-way tie with two other cars, including The King (Richard Petty), who is retiring.  The King is leaving behind a position as a product endorser that Lightning McQueen would love to have.  Another race between the three winners is ordered to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen heads off to California in a trailer pulled by Mack (John Ratzenberger).  McQueen insists Mack drive through the night to California.  Unfortunately, Mack falls asleep and leaves McQueen in the desert.  Reminiscent of ""Doc Hollywood,"" McQueen ends up in the town of Radiator Springs, where he needs to perform public service.  Similar to Michael J. Fox's character in ""Doc Hollywood,"" McQueen is arrogant and over-confident.  Fortunately, his experiences with the denizens of Radiator Springs may change his attitude and his life.<br /><br />Radiator Springs is filled with all sorts of characters.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is a former big-city attorney who dreamed of a slower pace and the beauty of the desert.  Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) is an enigmatic character with a secret past.  George Carlin is amusing as Fillmore.  Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub and Larry the Cable Guy all voice various characters with their own hopes, dreams and past.<br /><br />The question remains, where does all this lead?  The answer is that it leads to a funny story with a moral hidden behind it all; perhaps more than one moral.<br /><br />I was reluctant to see this movie in the theaters when it came out.  I am not a NASCAR fan and the commercials for this movie seemed to focus too much on the racing aspect of the movie.  Fortunately, while the movie opens and closes with a race, the rest of the movie is about life, and life, just like this movie, should be enjoyed, and there should be humor, which this movie has.<br /><br />This movie is a bit lighter than previous Pixar films.  However, the graphics are phenomenal and the story is easy to follow.  The detail in the scenery and in the machinery continuously amazed me.  Digital animation has come a long way in the last couple of decades and ""Cars"" is contains every technical achievement possible in animation.  I think the kind of animation in ""Cars"" no longer amazes many of us because we have seen it so many times before.  Fortunately, the story is enjoyable and there is reasonably good humor to keep you interested to the end of the movie.  There is a slow spot in the middle of the movie, but the animation fascinated me at that point and I was trying to figure out how this movie might end so that I hardly noticed the slow point.<br /><br />""Cars"" has it all.  Great animation, a reasonably good story, an all-star cast, and humor.  There are a number of inside jokes, most of which I failed to catch.

809023,B000H7I6CU, A1LHPS1PADD9FM,5.0, Another hit for Pixar!,"Before I start this review, let me just say that at 30 years old, I still have a soft spot for most animated movies.  I have seen every Disney/Pixar movie including this one.  When I saw the trailer for Cars before a showing of The Incredibles (the ONLY Pixar movie I own), I knew I had to see it.  Now on to my review:<br /><br />After last year's dark but brilliantly done The Incredibles, Pixar decided to do a lighter and more family-friendly movie.<br /><br />I saw Cars the day after it was released, and the animation is just as stunning as most of Pixar's other movies (except Incredibles which was better).  The actors providing the voices were fantastic, including Paul Newman, who voices the wise Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hornet.  While the plot was not a new one, it was great nevertheless. I especailly liked the subplot of Lightning McQueen and his love interest, a Porsche named Sally Carrera. However, the plot does drag a little bit, but the kids (ages 2 - 10) that were in the theater with me were entertained.<br /><br />You have to stick around for the end credits - as with all Disney/Pixar movies, you never know what they'll do during the credits!  The short that preceded the movie, ""One Man Band"" was cute - it used only music and animation, not dialogue, to tell the story of two one man bands competing for a child's coin.<br /><br />As I walked out of the theater smiling, there was a big crowd waiting for the next showing. I knew that Pixar would have another hit, and I was right.",Cars
809024,B000H7I6CU, A1WB5NZYY5XR8A,5.0," Unoriginal, but thoroughly creative and enjoyable!","I went into Cars with not very high expectations. I don't know why considering Pixar has a perfect batting average when it comes to making good films. Perhaps it was the unbelievably high amount of negative reviews I was reading about the film. In the end, I think this was a good thing as it allowed me to watch a movie that would surpass my expectations, and I love it when a movie is better than I expect.<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about Cars is that it's an abstract fantasy. Much of the criticism I hear is about how the film's setting doesn't make sense logically. Here we have a world populated by cars which feature accomodations such as doors and seats for humans that don't exist. I find this a silly thing to get hung up on as it has no bearing on the story of the film which uses personified cars as clever characterizations of people.<br /><br />The film opens up strong and engages you right from the beginning. I hate NASCAR, but I had no problem enjoying the visuals of the film's openning race that would serve to tell the motive of the main character, Lightning McQueen, as well as set up the conflict he would have to overcome.<br /><br />The story itself is completely unoriginal and full of cliche, but this does not detract much from the film. Even if feel at points that you've been there, seen that, you really haven't due to the interesting twist of the movie's unique setting (cars instead of people in case you haven't been following along). You also haven't seen this story (Doc Hollywood) done so well. Were this a serious drama, the cliche and stereotypes that are rampant in the film would be a negative, but as a comedy they only add to the film's characterization of Americana and society.<br /><br />The pleasure in this film isn't wondering what's going to happen next. In deed, the film is entirely predictable, but fitting to the theme of the movie it's a great ride. Lightning McQueen starts off as a hot shot racing car celebrity who ends up trapped in a small town and ends up learning what's important in life. The pleasure is in watching the growth and development of the main character on his journey to enlightenment (read: not being a self-centered, egotistical moron) and all the encounters with the story's other denizens along the way.<br /><br />Much like Ellen Degeneres did in Finding Nemo, Larry the Cable Guy steals the show as the lovable tow truck named Mater. You don't have to be a fan to appreciate his performance. And Luke Wilson has become a master at making the unlikable-ignorant-jerk likable.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much children will enjoy this film. It's slow in parts much like The Incredibles was, but unlike that film it doesn't have the big action scenes as pay off. The film is definately good for kids and teaches morals such as 'it's not whether you win or lose but how you play that matters.' However, the overall story seems more aimed at adults. Still, I didn't hear any kids complaining at my trip to the theatre so don't be concerned about taking them.<br /><br />Pixar returns to it's roots with the same style film as Toy Story 1 & 2. It also keeps with it's tradition of being an impeccable movie studio that never fails to impress. Cars is another homerun for the studio and easily one of the best films of the year.",Cars
809025,B000H7I6CU, A1C80B497LCYKA,5.0, SURPRISINGLY CLEVER AND ENGAGING,"I doubted whether a story populated with cars could actually make an interesting movie, but boy was I wrong. Once again, Pixar has come up with a story that is both engaging and meaningful, whose characters are endearing with effects that take animation one more level up. I actually fell in love with the little red racecar named Lightning McQueen. Now, I know guys are supposed to love cars - but this is ridiculous.<br /><br />Lightning is in love with himself. He thinks he doesn't need anyone else, even a pit crew. As the fastest rookie on the circuit, he thinks he's got everything he needs. He three-way ties for first place in the Piston Cup race and has to do a race off in California with the two other fastest cars: ego maniac Chick Hicks and good ol' boy The King. But on the way, he gets lost in the Arizona desert and ends up in a little forgotten town on legendary Route 66 called Radiator Springs, where he tears up the pavement on the town's main street and has to serve time repairing it. In the course of events, a little tow truck named Mater befriends him, as do most of the rest of the town, and he discovers there's been something missing from his life that he kind of likes: friends. He's been in such a hurry to be the fastest car on the track that he hasn't taken the time to enjoy, or realize how much he needs, other people - er, cars.<br /><br />It's a great story, and masterfully directed by John Lasseter (Toy Story I & II, A Bug's Life). Owen Wilson's voice is perfect for Lightning, as is Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. The writing is superb, and the animation - whew! The Nascar experience is perfectly reproduced with everyone participating as a vehicle - including the audience and announcers. There are even some actual racecar drivers playing themselves as cars, like Darrell Waltrip and Mario Andretti.<br /><br />The Route 66 experience is equally compelling, and actually the best part of the film, in my opinion. The underlying message is that there is something missing in our fast paced lives that if we would just slow down we might recapture. Thus, the metaphor between the race track (as well as the Interstate) and Route 66, which used to be a very scenic, well driven road that represented a more gracious time in our history - a time when friends and family were more important than getting ahead and winning the rat race.<br /><br />It's a great movie and a great DVD - a little slim on the extra features, but still well worth the money. I hope you fall in love with Lightning McQueen as I did.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith",Cars
809026,B000H7I6CU, A2INL3AYAT6325,4.0, An enjoyable but not great film,"I tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released.<br /><br />Not up to normal/past Pixar standards.<br /><br />I say it is most like A Bugs Life.  A good but not great film.<br /><br />Music did nothing for me.  Where was the normal stand out musical score?<br /><br />Standard extras, BUT no Making Of section.  I would have liked to have seen that.<br /><br />SOMETHING I HATE ABOUT SOME DVD PACKAGES.  THOSE HORRIBLE FLIP DOWN OPENERS.  YUCK!!!!!!<br /><br />Kids will enjoy.

809028,B000H7I6CU, A2BEU7GPGNIG44,5.0," Awesome DVD, Slick Packaging, Kids Love It","Disney's Pixar Car Cars was the number one animated feature film of 2006. If you didn't catch the movie in theaters, surely you were aware that the movie was out. The branding campaign for this movie was unprecedented it seems with available merchandise ranging from breakfast cereals to children's gym shoes, books, video games, apparel, posters and more.<br /><br />Well if you didn't catch the movie in theaters the good thing is that now you can pick up the DVD. If you did check out the movie this past summer, chances are this is one that you may want to add to your DVD collection.<br /><br />Cars is the story about a red race car named Lightning McQueen. It appears that he is rather new to the championship aspect of racing as he doesn't have the biggest endorsements and he is still chasing the coveted Piston Cup. On his way to the Piston Cup Championship Race, the big rig truck that is carrying him dozes off and McQueen is accidentally ejected from the rig. This leaves McQueen lost in the middle of nowhere. He rips into a really old town named Radiator Springs where he is stranded. The town needs a new road and they enlist McQueen's help. McQueen isn't quite willing to help in the beginning but he soon grows close to the people he meets in town like the rusty pick-up truck Toe-Mater and a pretty blue Porsche named Sally.<br /><br />Cars is a really endearing story and the critics who hail the film as an instant classic are right on the money. It's a story you won't forget after watching it. However, the film is very long clocking in at 116 minutes, just four minutes under 2 hours. Some kids may get bored during parts of the film. The film has such a fast paced beginning and slows down drastically while McQueen is in Radiator Springs. The pace picks up again toward the end of the film after McQueen is rescued from Radiator Springs, but younger kids may have tuned out long ago.<br /><br />The film is rated G, but I will note there is one scene where McQueen shouts out that he is stuck in ""Hillbilly Hell.""",Cars
809029,B000H7I6CU, A1KR76YD18XX8V,5.0, Pixar has done it again!,"I thought this movie was great even though the story was predictable.  It kept me entertained every minute!  One of my favorite scenes was when the two Italian cars got all dressed up to cheer at a race, and I almost died laughing since they looked just like the Italians we saw here in Germany during the month of World Cup games.<br /><br />I also love that Pixar takes pride in the details.  The non-talking characters in the movie were just as well thought out and lovingly crafted as the ""human""  characters.<br /><br />Another great thing about Pixar is they continue to entertain even after the story is over. The credits in this one were especially great. If you see it don't even think about leaving the movie theater until the credits are done rolling.<br /><br />And finally, I was impressed by the number of notable people they had play caricatures of themselves. Mario Andretti, Richard Petty and his wife Lynda, Bob Costas, Darrell Waltrip, and Dale Earnhardt Jr. were all in there. (Not that I knew this until I checked out the IMDB entry for the movie, but it's still cool. I'm sure there are other famous names that I just don't know since I'm not a NASCAR fan.) Aside from racing names, they also had Click and Clack from NPR, as well as Jay Leno playing a TV talk show car called ""Jay Limo.""<br /><br />Genius!!",Cars

809031,B000H7I6CU, AUTBHG6070SL4,4.0, Another cute one from Pixar,"No doubt, there are great animations coming from lots of production companies these days. Some even get a fair bit of star power for the voice actors. Despite high standards all around, though, Pixar reliably comes through with the best in scripts and characterization, on top of cutting edge technology.<br /><br />The story itself is kid-friendly: an obnoxious egotist discovers the value of having friends. But, as with any familiar recipe, it's easy to enjoy yet another preparation of it if done well. Pixar's real strength, all the way back to Luxo Junior, lies in bringing the character to life. Their artists have a wild talent for giving feeling and personality to inanimate obejects, while staying (mostly) true to the object itself. When the objects are as varied as cars and trucks are already, that gives them huge scope to work with - and they do. From Doc, to Lightning, to Sally, to Mater (get it? ""to mater""?), to the tractors, each comes across as a unique individual. It doesn't hurt to have little things like Tom & Ray - aka Klick and Klack, the real-world car guys - helping out.<br /><br />Too bad I missed this when it first came out. It's held up well, though, and will remain enjoyable for years to come. And no, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it.<br /><br />-- wiredweird",Cars

The animation in this movie is gorgeous, and the story brings a smile to your face, and you can't help falling in love with all of the colorful characters. This is movie is worth seeing.",Cars
809038,B000H7I6CU, A4GB8I8ACS4PM,5.0, Cars on Blu-ray is a WINNER!!!!!,"When Cars first came out on DVD, I was a little disappointed because there weren't very many extras on it.  I didn't understand why Pixar would take one of their most popular films and give it such a mediocre treatment.  Well.....now that I have the Blu-ray version of this film, I think I know why.  They were saving it all for Cars debut on hi-def.  This has to be the best looking picture I have seen yet on a hi-def title.  I looks almost like the entire film is in 3-D!!!  I managed to catch part of this movie on a hi-def cable channel and thought I would compare the two pictures.  After a little fiddling, I managed to get both screens at the exact same frame, and was blown away at how much clearer the Blu-ray picture is.  The Cine-Explore feature on this is the best special feature I've seen on a hi-def title.  It is almost sensory overload at the amount of material that continuously pops up across the screen while the film is playing.  This disc will be the one I will pop in to show my friends what Blu-ray is capable of doing.  Every Blu-ray owner needs to get this title.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",Cars
809039,B000H7I6CU, A3FEQXNCFC68KC,5.0," Pixar does it again, but it had to grow on me.","When I saw this movie in the theaters I enjoyed watching it enough, but I kept thinking this was the worst Pixar film I have seen. Funny thing is the worst Pixar film is still A grade material compared to most other animated features released. And while Cars didn't wow me on the big screen the way The Incredibles or Monsters Inc (or a score of other Pixar films) the film grew on me in a big way when we got it home. You see my son (two years old at the time) loved to watch it. Being the inclusive dad that I am I would watch it with him. I got what Pixar was doing when I first saw Cars, but it didn't resonate with me until repeated viewings. Now, while it's still not my favorite Pixar movie, Cars made a believer out of me in what they were saying about this film.<br /><br />You see Cars isn't just a cartoon about a world where cars are people. It's a tribute of the history of the automobile, a nod to NASCAR and its roots, and a love letter to Route 66. All of this done in a family-friendly and colorful animated universe. Any car nut with a broad spectrum interest in the automobile will find lots of different cars from different eras getting face time on this movie. NASCAR fans will love the racing sequences and level of detail dedicated to the sport. Those who remember the days before the Interstate system where there was as much fun travelling to your destination as there was being there will feel nostalgic for that time again. The movie hits on multiple levels, which is what makes it better than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Take that all away and you still have a fun cartoon. You have cars talking and acting like people for God's sake! The kids will eat that up! Cars are getting into crazy situations that are in their own way a slight play on human issues. There are plenty of little jokes on that vein that both the kids and parents can laugh over. There is even a joke or two with a double meaning the adults may get a kick out of. This is all classic Pixar and does much to fill in the little spaces between story development.<br /><br />The story? Well like I said when I first saw it I got what they were saying, but wasn't impressed. It's essentially much like an episode of The Andy Griffith Show I remember seeing where somebody from the big city gets stuck in Mayberry, desparate to get out, only to end up loving the town and wanting more. Maybe it was because it was in a way the preachiest of the Pixar films telling us we should slow down our busy lives and go back to simpler times. Not that it's a bad message. Just not one that held onto on first viewing. Well after watching it several more times with my excited toddler the little details come into play that I either missed or ignored the first time around. The sleepy town that slowly comes to life the more their new visitor gives to it. The beautiful backdrops of painted deserts and canyons. There is character growth going on.<br /><br />Cartoons live and die by their voice actors. While just about every animation company puts out movies that take advantage of celebrity power to gain an audience Pixar is one of the few who has consistently been able to get the best performances from them, and cars is no different. Every celebrity voice is pitch perfect and puts you in the view of the character more than the actor. Larry the Cable Guy as Mater the tow truck easily steals the show, but does it in such a way where you absolutely know it's Larry doing the voice, but you see Mater as a character in of itself rather than a cartoon Larry. Owen Wilson puts his best sly, but whiner-like demeanor for racing star McQueen that's his best. Some characters I still have trouble recognizing the transformation is so good. Tony Shalhoub (better known as Monk from the TV series) is absolutely unbelievable as tire shop owner Luigi. Better yet Michael Keaton as Chic Hicks barely sounds like Michael. Michael makes what is essentially the villain in the movie a very enjoyable and charismatic cut up. I can go on, but suffice it to say the ""acting"" is top notch.<br /><br />Animation wise all I have to say is this is Pixar. They are just about the best in the business and what you see in this movie will impress even today. The race scenes are dynamically shot the same way you would see a big NASCAR race with gravel, debris, smoke and skid marks looking real. The level of detail is very impressive from the waxed shine on the cars to the minute dust.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray release is pretty much identical to the previous release, but this time they include the DVD version as well. The differences between the Blu-Ray and DVD versions visually are striking, and that's admitting the DVD looks great. The Blu-Ray technically has two menus, but that's not a big deal. One of the menus has three options which are the movie, bonus cartoons and featurettes. Here's a breakdown (features on the DVD will have an * beside them):<br /><br />Mater and the Ghost Light*: Like all Pixar releases Cars comes with both the animated short that was viewed before the movie in theaters plus a totally new short related to the movie itself. This is a story about Mater scaring the town with little tricks so he is told a story about the infamous Ghost Light, which he then appears to experience after left alone. Goofy funny with Mater kind of replaying a number of scenes from the movie in a different way.<br /><br />One Man Band*: This is the short that was played before the movie in theaters. It's about two street musicians ""dueling"" for a little girl's coin. The musicians get more outrageous in their zeal for the money and things end up going crazy.<br /><br />Mater in Bounding: Remember the Pixar short with the Jackalope and sheep? Well this is a quickie (non hi-def) short of Mater replacing the sheep bouncing all over the place. I think it's something the animators put together for fun and are sharing with us.<br /><br />End Credits: Here you can see the animation end credits in full frame without the credits. Love the previous Pixar movie references.<br /><br />Production Features include:<br /><br />Two Full Length Commentaries: One is by Lasseter and the other with the production team (with pictures).<br /><br />Inspiration for 'Cars'*: Documentary told by John Lasseter on the inspiration for Cars including a jaunt through Route 66 and seeing some race cars in action.<br /><br />Documentary Shorts: There are seven little items here. ""Radiator Springs,"" ""Character Design,"" ""Animation and Acting,"" ""Real World Racing: Getting Geeky with the Details,"" ""Hudson Hornet,"" ""Graphics"" and ""Darrell Waltrip Museum Tour"". This is the real meat of the extras. You get to see the real love for the source material and how much they put into making the movie as much a car-lovers movie as possible.<br /><br />Cine-Explore: This is a way to see behind the scenes stuff while watching the movie. You can set it automatic or manually punch in the content. Much of the content comes from the other featurettes.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes*: These are just sketches and storyboards that never went beyond pre-production. It's interesting to see how the script evolved, but don't expect extra cartoons.<br /><br />Carfinder Game: It's dubbed as a very sophisticated BD game, but I call it incredibly tedious. The has three play modes. The primary mode is where you have to select a car from the bottom of your screen when it shows up in the movie. Next is the same concept, but this time the screen is frozen for an amount of time due to a massive amount of cars to rummage through. Third is like a bonus round where you get three images of the same car and you have to pick which one is accurate (with the other two having often the slightest differences in them).<br /><br />The reward for going through the game (which you cannot get out of until you finish the movie with it) is a Showroom that has all the cars you found. You can click on the showroom and get a pretty neat profile of that car and it's personal history. I have to admit I really like getting this information as it broadens the story greatly. It's just a bear of a game to go through. This isn't a casual game to kill a little time. Be prepared to commit.<br /><br />Cars is one of those movies that is very different from anything else out there, but then again you can say that for a good number of Pixar movies. It's a great movie for the car lover and those who enjoy remembering the 1950's driving experience where drive-ins and cruising mainstreet were how you treat a Friday night. Oh yeah... car racing fans will definitely get a kick out this film. If you aren't into any of that then you still should give this movie a try. It's VERY accessible to just everybody out there.",Cars

You can see the detail on the rust stains on Mater and for the most part, if you put in your DVD, you can see how much of a difference the film looks in HD via Blu-ray over its DVD counterpart.  Vibrant colors, more detail and overall, a beautiful video transfer with no blemishes, compression artifacts whatsoever.<br /><br />Audio is presented in English 5.1 (uncompressed, 48 kHz/24-Bit) and the racing segments really utilize the surround channels but also the LFE.  It's one thing to have the nice clear dialogue and music through the front and center channels but to hear the cars speeding on the raceway and zooming and hearing through the surrounds is fantastic.  Crashes bring out the booms and the audience on the race track can be heard on the surround channels.

The picture and audio quality of ""Cars"" in High Definition is still magnificent but of course since the original Blu-ray was released in 2007, the lossless audio soundtrack is presented in English 5.1 uncompressed (48 kHz/24-Bit) instead of the current 5.1 or 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack that Pixar films are offered in today's Blu-ray releases.  But still, it's uncompressed audio and the lossless audio soundtrack of this Blu-ray release is still fantastic.  And of course, picture quality is still outstanding.<br /><br />As for the ""Ultimate Cars Gift Pack"", the release is right on time for the holidays.  With many people now moving to Blu-ray and many Disney/Pixar fans knowing that ""Cars"" is one of those must-have films to own, Disney is offering a gift pack that includes a DVD (which is great for the kids during long commutes) and two exclusive cars with custom Ransburg paint.<br /><br />Really, there's nothing negative that can be said about ""Cars - Ultimate Cars Gift Pack"".  If you have know someone who is new to Blu-ray and is a Disney/Pixar fan, this is a wonderful holiday gift to give.  It's a high quality release that is definitely recommended!",Cars
809041,B000H7I6CU, A38N7SFDOB3MR3,5.0, Original and Heart Warming. 90 out of 100,"After seeing so many children's movies with animals lately (Hoodwinked, Over the Hedge, Ice Age 2, etc.) Cars was a needed change. It was wonderful sitting down to a movie that offered something a bit different. Don't get me wrong, our family loves movies with goofy animals. But after laughing at and with Tow Mater for 2 hours, I was so glad I didn't see a silly squirrel in the whole movie. Tow Mater was awesome. We all hope to see Tow starring in his own flick! Bring on the sequel!!!<br /><br />With that said, Cars is a heart warming story of a race car called Lightning McQueen who is full of himself. Lightning stumbles off the beaten path of life, and onto the backroads of route 66. There, Lightning McQueen finds all the things he was missing in life because of his self-absorption: friends, beauty, and love.<br /><br />I was very pleasantly suprised with the story. Yes, Cars had many, many funny parts (especially the tractor tipping, and Tow Mater), but the story itself is what shines like a diamond. Cars is a movie that will have you leaving the theatre changed, looking for love, beauty and cherishing what you have. I can't give a movie any greater compliment than this. A must see, and must own children's movie.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 90<br /><br />43 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br /><br />10 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br /><br />9 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br /><br />10 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?<br /><br />Plus 2 extra bonus points for Tow Mater! Tow is a one one a kind children's movie character that will not soon be forgotten.",Cars
809042,B000H7I6CU, AV5G37VFE5NVD,5.0, Another delightful family film from Pixar,"In Pixar's CARS, directed by TOY STORY director John Lasseter, the world is populated entirely by - you guessed it - cars.  So it's only natural that the biggest event in the entire car world is the Piston Cup, the world's most popular race (inspired by the ever-popular NASCAR racing).  This year, the public's rooting for Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), an immensely-talented albeit egotistic rookie.  While traveling to California to prepare for the Piston Cup, Lightning's driver, Mack (John Ratzenberger), dozes off and sends Lightning off into the middle of nowhere.  The middle of nowhere happens to be the small town of Radiator Springs, or - as Lightning described it - ""hillbilly hell"".  Though at first Lightning wants nothing more than to escape from Radiator Springs and win the Piston Cup, he gradually becomes more and more attached to the town and its citizens, eventually realizing that friends and family mean more than fame.<br /><br />Pixar makes family movies better than anyone.  Adults find their films just as entertaining as do children.  CARS is no exception, though it lacks the power of many of Pixar's previous creations, such as TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  Also, it is becoming more and more clear that Pixar's films seem to revolve around the same sort of formula.  Eventually, I believe that this will begin to bother some adults, but the children will go on loving these films, and that's what the films are here for in the first place.<br /><br />The cast for CARS is even more impressive than that of previous Pixar films.  The cast includes, along with Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, NASCAR racers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr., FINDING NEMO/A BUG'S LIFE director Andrew Stanton, Jay Leno, and Michael Keaton.  That is quite the cast.  It also features music by Randy Newman and some fantastic animation.<br /><br />Despite all that it has going for it, CARS was considered a flop at the box office, primarily when compared to Pixar's previous masterpieces.  I believe that this is due in part to the advertising, which I thought made the film look like many of the other stupid CGI family film imitations in theaters recently.  All I can say is disregard the advertising and see the film for yourself.  It's another delightful family film from Pixar.  Your kids'll love it, and you'll love it too.  What more could you ask for?",Cars
809043,B000H7I6CU, ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,4.0," Entertaining with Likable Characters, Amazing with Rich and Beautiful Colors","The greatest thing about `Cars,' the latest film coming from Pixar, is its rich and beautiful colors of the picture. Even those who points out the weakness of the story (which resembles that of Michael J. Fox film `Doc Hollywood') would admit the merit. After all, you just cannot keep telling good stories with originality forever, and Pixar is no exception. In `Cars' the respected company has decided on seeking the originality in another direction, that is, the setting of the film, in which all the characters are really cars, trucks, or any vehicle you can see on the road.<br /><br />That means you don't see any humans here. The hero of the film is Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), hot shot race car who is stranded in the middle of nowhere, a sleepy town called Radiator Springs, after a series of incredible but funny misadventures. After damaging the town's main road, he is sentenced to community service in the court by Doc Hudson (voice by Paul Newman) while Lightning has to be in the next big race in California.<br /><br />The town's `people' or cars are mostly misfits and rejects - the motif frequently used in Pixar films - and corky Lightning finds the life there miserable and hellish, but you know, people, no, cars change.<br /><br />The film's idea about the cars and other vehicles is stretched to the point of some bizarre scenes - such as groupie cars, public restroom for cars, or car bugs that really fly - and you may not be impressed by all of them. Unlike `The Incredibles' or `Monster's Inc' the script of `Cars' is not the most original one in the marvelous history of Pixar, and the film's length (about 2 hours) makes us wish for the year 1995 when Pixar managed to make `Toy Story' that runs only 81 minutes and still is as good and enjoyable.<br /><br />Still brilliant images full of striking colors and wonderful designs would appeal to everyone. The speedy car race sequences are brilliantly done, and the designs of the deserted town of Radiator Springs are often astonishingly real. And in spite of the weak story, the characters themselves are all well-written and likable, as those in the previous Pixar films are. Maybe `Cars' failed to reach the high standard of recent animations that Pixar has been pushing higher and higher, but it is still entertaining with a bit of sentimental and nostalgic feeling.",Cars
809044,B000H7I6CU, ANUBY6KOT60WH,5.0, What a soundtrack!,"A lovely movie that leaves the kids with a beautiful life lesson and big time entertaining for the whole family. Main character is Lightning McQueen, a beautiful little spoiled racing car too vain of his own early success to see beyond his own unexperience. Too proud and sure of himself to rely on others' advice, and believing that he would never be in need of anyone else. When he accidentally falls off the truck that was taking him to California to participate in the Piston Racing Coup, he finds himself on his own in an unknown place. Lost and alone he gets to Radiator Springs, a long-ago forgotten community struggling to stay in business nevertheless no big roads or highways pass nearby. A bunch of colorful guys there, with engines and parts perhaps not so brand-new and shiny but with certainly far more experience will eventually make him value all those meaningful and important things that go far beyond the mere outside looks and efervescent success: friendship, companionship, experience, and love.<br />...And plus: what a soundtrack! Rascal Flatts' version of ""Life is a highway"" got me rocking all the way home after the movie theater... These guys are just purely and plainly great and make unbelievable music, even when remaking a new version of this famous 80's tune. I love them. Sheryl Crow's ""Real Gone"" opening theme rocks! The rest of the soundtrack is just as great combining classic tunes by Chuck Berry and James Taylor with performances by Brad Paisley, John Mayer and others. My advice: buy the movie DVD along with the soundtrack CD! You won't regret it.",Cars
809045,B000H7I6CU, A35W4P12HPDHNF,5.0, Little girls LOVE talking cars!,"I had no idea how much my 2 1/2 year old daughter would love this movie until we saw it.  She's seen it 5, yes 5, times now, and she gets more excited each time she sees it.  It's such a nice change of pace to watch an exciting well-made kid's movie.  The cg-graphics are spellbindingly awesome, and the cast of characters is unforgettable.  My girl ""acts out"" scenes from the movie with her die-cast cars every day.",Cars
809046,B000H7I6CU, A1A6KF9MZENFN9,4.0," Not as good as The Incredibles, but still a master piece of CGI movie making!","A little known secret about Pixar, is their huge support for their local community.  Last night I attended a fund raiser premier of CARS at Pixar's studio's in Emeryville CA.  The event raised over $80,000 for our local school district!<br /><br />So here are my thoughts on the movie.<br /><br />Firstly, this is a fast paced and LOUD movie.  Those with sensitive ears should think about taking cotton buds to the theater.<br /><br />Ok, I read some of the comments so far based on the teaser's and have to say that the animated cars are done wonderfully.  Each car really has it's own personality and although they do look a little cartoonish, Pixar has again shown that they can animate anything and bring it to life and then some.<br /><br />The big race scenes are really only at the very beginning and at the very end, the majority of the movie is set in a small town ""Radiator Springs"" somewhere in the midwest just off Route 66.<br /><br />I won't give too much away as far as the story goes, you'll need to go see it yourself for that.<br /><br />The movie is packed full of very funny jokes and scenes, like the Tractor Tipping scene, and the SUV off-road bootcamp!<br /><br />Visually, this movie is stunning.  I can't imagine the amount of research that went into producing this one.  Anyone who has driven I-40 near Amarillo TX will recognise the mountain ranges shaped like old Cadillac's burried nose down in the sand.  They really capture the road trip experience.  And the scenery is breath-taking.<br /><br />Not being a big fan of ""Larry The Cable Guy"" I have to say that his performance as Mater the tow truck, was brilliant.  As one of the main characters, he was very funny and endearing.<br /><br />Technically, Pixar really pushed the envelope again.  We're used to Pixar movies breaking ground in each movie, the underwater rendering in Finding Nemo, the fur rendering in Monsters Inc., etc.. In cars, it's all about the rendering of dust particles which looks super realistic and is not an easy thing to achieve.<br /><br />Overall, this movie will have great appeal to a lot of people, although I personally think that The Incredibles is still my favorite.  This one might not win the Best Animated Feature award but I'm sure it will get awards for the technical aspects of the film.<br /><br />Finally, I just want to thank Pixar once again for their amazing and continued support to the local community, whether it be fund raising events like last nights, or the masses of computers they donate to the schools, or the number of their employee's that regularly volunteer their freetime to work with the kids in mentoring programs.  I couldn't wish for a better neighbor.",Cars
809047,B000H7I6CU, A37YYE73XR83FI,4.0, Surprisingly enjoyable for a non-NASCAR fan,"I had low expectations for this film.  I think the title is pathetically uninspired and lifeless.  I thought the Cable Guy would be the overly talkative, obnoxious character like Donkey in Shrek.  And, not being a big expert/fan of cars in general, I thought I might be overall underwhelmed. But, my father wanted to see this, so I took him to see it for Father's Day.  And, I had the best day with him in a long time.  Amazingly captivating--with a few details that are culturally overplayed groaners--and well paced, CARS takes a checkered flag in my book.  I have seen probably more computer animated films than I'd like to see in one year. [I was equally surprised by Over The Hedge.  Ice Age 2 was a bit of a disappointment, though.] But, I was happy after seeing this one.  I have read other reviews that mention a slight disapproval with how the cars handle some activities without the use of humans(ie. answering the phone and working the gas pumps) and have to agree with them.  But, I wouldn't like that to ruin the film for me.  One of the funnier highlights is the use of cars as even the insects of the film.  Oh, and stay through the credits for a satisfying end note.",Cars

Although I am a fan of open-wheel Indy car and Grand Prix racing, not NASCAR, it was a hoot following Paul Newman's character, a crusty retired former champion car. I think the movie is over the heads of most kids Brianna's age, and a bit too long for anyone younger, but its failures are minor compared to its achievements. It teaches lessons in humility and in perserverance and in the rewards of doing the right thing even if it costs you something you really want.",Cars

809059,B000H7I6CU, A1AISPOIIHTHXX,4.0, Halfway between great and okay,"Even in the teaser trailer phase of a film's release, many people were not anticipating Cars that much. Was it because they had come off the action-packed the Incredibles and people weren't exactly revving (pun maybe intended) for talking cars? Or was it just simply the idea seemed weird? Whatever the case, the general reaction upon its release was it was good-but-not-great; the one that ruined Pixar's 6 for 6 winning streak. So is it that bad? Well no, but the idea this is a horrible film is just really pushing it but it's still a lesser effort.<br /><br />In a world where everyone and everything's car-related, the story centers on Lightning McQueen, a hotshot racer who only thinks of himself. After a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup and on route to California for the finals, he's accidentally dumped on the Interstate and ends up in a small town called Radiator Springs. There, he meets a number of cars trying to keep their struggling town alive while Lightning learns it's better to think of more things than winning.<br /><br />Let's get the good stuff out of the way. While everyone sings 3D animation praises, a slight backlash was created when Disney at one point abandoned traditional 2D thanks to the failures of Home on the Range and Brother Bear, making audiences hate 3D a bit since more and more (and more) 3D movies were being released. But still, the computer animators outdid themselves since almost every new camera angle gives us something to marvel; from the neon lights to the sheen of polished cars to the landscape. It's also a bit more movie-esque in the more bigger action scenes, making it a bit more dynamic. There's also some inspired gags like bugs that are actually Bugs as in Volkswagon Beetles while cow-tipping as been replaced by tractor tipping.<br /><br />In a couple of commentaries, Pixar head John Lasseter said that a goal of Pixar was to make you see familiar worlds in a new light. Imagine toys that can talk, monsters having feelings or the burdens of being a superhero. Does anybody really wonder what a car does? While that's not to say the idea at least sounds pretty neat but it just seems awkward that we have to get sympathetic to a talking car. While I'm not being kind of pessimistic and it's unfair to say every Pixar film has to be at least masterpiece-level or it's awful, you can admit at least there's some problems with the film anyway.<br /><br />One problem is the story. It's weird how there's as much as 6 people who work on the screenplay yet it feels so padded in its story. There's a whole lot of scenes that are meant to develop everyone but everyone seems kind of one-dimensional anyway and main hero Lightning just sounds like a jerk all the way through even with a newer enlightenment (could be a Owen Wilson problem though). The James Taylor ""Our Town"" song is meant to be the emotional scene but it pales to the Sarah McLachlan-sung ""Jessie's story"" scene in Toy Story 2. The voice acting is a bit more stunt casting, probably catching it from Dreamworks' tendency to get big-name stars to voice everyone.<br /><br />Pixar was excellent when it came down to DVD's packed with information about making the film. Sure A Bug's Life and the Toy Story films started out kind of thin but when Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and the Incredibles had top-tier DVD's, seeing Cars quite small extras is disappointing. We get the kinda-funny short One Man Band while a new short involving the tow-truck Mater is not that funny. Everything else is light on insight and you'll instantly think of a double-dip in its future. But strangely, I ended up buying it anyway knowing there was a bigger release somewhere in the future. It'll probably come around Ratatouille's DVD release (which, by the way, looks quite promising).<br /><br />I don't love the movie yet I don't outright hate it and I won't hold Pixar's past achievements against it but based on the film alone, it is a bit disappointing there's just some issues that the film has you wish were fixed.",Cars

The main character is Lightning McQueen, the self-centered, sassy young car whose goal is to displace veteran cars and win the coveted Piston Cup, the pinnacle of car racing.  When he finishes the big race in a dead heat with two other cars, he qualifies for a re-run of the race in California.  On his way to the race, McQueen falls out of his transport van and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs on Route 66.  While he's there, McQueen learns what it's like to work as part of a team and to really care about people.  We watched this DVD as three generations, and there was something to appeal to everyone.  Grandpa and Gran were impressed with the rendering of the cars from the 50's and 60's, Mom and Dad loved the story, and the grandkids enjoyed the action and the loveable characters.

The whole human world has been transfigured, as ""Braking News"" comes on television, and cars watch their fellow heroes in Nascar-type races in the stands.  Playfully, we enter into the world of ""Lightning McQueen"" (Owen Wilson) who is trying to win his first ""Piston Cup"".  He is full of himself and not just engine oil, so he lazily creates a three-way tie with two other prima dona cars.  The tie-breaker takes place in California, but his smugness gets him off guard, and he is stuck with a sleepy desert town, Radiator Springs, off Route 66.  Here he meets some interesting fellow cars, including Hudson ""Doc"" Hornet (Paul Newman), a former racer and the town's judge, a rundown tow truck, Mater (Larry, the Cable Guy), and Sally, a Porche from L.A., enjoying the slower life as a lawyer in the country.  There's a love interest, but her distaste for his ego provides a series of events to have his egomania retreaded.<br /><br />'Cars' has a lot of heart inside its chasis.  We forget we are dealing with cars that our laughter and tears come to the fore without us thinking about it.  It's the human comedy with a theme to reflect on slowing down and enjoying the road(s) in life.  Surprisingly effective, the story is beautifully executed with nuances like vocal appearances by Bob Costas and Richard Petty, which authenticate the movie even more.<br /><br />'Cars' is the best of a great lot of animated features this year.  While 'Curious George' and 'Monster House' help reinvent animation, 'Cars' gets to the finish line better with a great story and a funny, touching delivery.",Cars

The comparison to real life celebrities, racers, and past celebrities was simply brilliant. There is great humor here along with some innuendo that made it fun for grown ups and kids alike. It's fast paced enough that there's not a lot of down time from one belly laugh to the next... and if you have ever been on a farm or know about cow-tipping, the tractor tipping scene is going to have you rolling on the floor!<br /><br />My son was laughing so hard in parts he couldn't catch his breath.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as a family movie that both children and adults will love.

I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson, but Cars was so good that I forgot that he was voicing Lightning McQueen, the rookie star vying for the Piston Cup and the prestigious Dynoco sponsorship.<br /><br />Everything in this movie was cars. Even the flies were tiny VW bugs. The animation was so crisp and clean that during the race at the beginning of the movie, some of the racing segments looked like real cars zooming around the track.<br /><br />The storyline is simple, yet quite relevant in this day and age of superstar athletes and the hunger for fame. Lightning, forced to serve community service in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs, ultimately learns that it's more important to be a champion on the inside, rather than on the outside with trophies and titles.<br /><br />I actually didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, but after a bit I was glad for the way it ended. A very strange side effect of seeing this movie in the theater was that on my way home, I kept seeing cars as humanlike, rather than strictly machinery. That's how well Pixar brought the cars to life. They made me see cars as alive (For about an hour.

All the actors who do the voices are fantastic! The story is heartwarming and gives a great message, without being condescending or politically correct. There is lots of humor for kids, as well as subtle stuff for parents to enjoy too.<br /><br />My only complaint I was hoping for more Bonus Feature material. The two short films ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" and ""One Man Band"" are great and I guess I just wish there were more extras like them.

It appeals on several levels:<br /><br />- Technical virtuosity and animation. Hey, it's Pixar.<br /><br />- Characters.  Lightning IS a hotshot youngster in for some learning.  The Sheriff is, well, the Sheriff.  Doc Hudson is - or comes to be - sympathetic.  You root for him and for Lightning at the end.<br /><br />-  Recent history.  How the Interstates eclipsed towns that they passed by.  The romance of old Route 66, ""the Mother Road.""  The hypnotic lure of Western landscapes - as the heroine fleeing from L.A. says, ""I fell in love."" The film is poetry at times.<br /><br />-  A paean to the Hudson Hornet racecar of the early 1950's.  I remember back then that even street Hudsons were low-slung somethings special.<br /><br />-  Just plain fun.  I wish the scene where the cars are boogey-dancing down the street could have gone on and on.  That Sheriff moved so cool.  The two Italians were sweet, too (the tire shop owner is a Fiat 500, by the way, Italy's remarkable postwar little two-cylinder car that went everywhere from the highest Alps to the lowest valleys).",Cars

All the characters are- yes- cars! This may take a little getting used to, but it works well.<br /><br />  Our hero, cocky young race car Lightning McQueen (voice of Owen Wilson), earns his way into a race-off for the Piston Cup, but he falls out of his truck and winds up in the colorful, but faded, Western town of Radiator Springs (a beautifully rendered duplicate of northern Arizona). There, he does community service as a paver while meeting the various<br /><br />""car-acters"" in town. The most interesting of these is Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), a sleek vintage '51 Hudson Hornet who serves as mayor, judge and doctor. There's also Mater, the zany tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy); Sally, the Porsche and former hotshot LA lawyer (a likable Bonnie Hunt), and a great little comic-relief duo: Luigi and Guido, the Italian-accented Fiat and forklift who run a tire store (Tony Shalhoub). Lightning<br /><br />learns a little more about life and returns to the speedway a new man- I mean car. It's all nicely done and has a different kind of feel than other Pixar movies- more of an easy-going road trip than a slam-bang adventure or undersea odyssey. The racing sequences, narrated by real-life announcers Bob Cutlass (I mean, Costas) and Darrell Waltrip, add genuine excitement that even non-gearheads like me will love. Did we mention that even the announcers are cars?<br /><br />  ""Cars"" comes in a package that's a little slimmer than the other Pixar DVDs, but this movie looks good. Two shorts, the cute ""One Man Band""<br /><br />(two street musicians, a boy, and an Italian town square) and ""Mater and the Ghostlight"", are part of it along with a short but interesting documentary that details Pixar honcho John Lasseter's surprising car background (his dad ran a body shop), love of Route 66-style road culture and research into NASCAR broadcasts. There's also an epilogue with little spoofs of past Pixar hits like ""Monster Trucks, Inc."" that will delight outtake fans. Musical choices include the doo-wop classic ""Sh-Boom"" (the Chords' version) and, at the end, a nifty take on ""Route 66"" by John Mayer. Randy Newman's back, too, with the poignant ""Our Town"" (sung by James Taylor).<br /><br />  ""Cars"" may not wow you at first, aside from the racing portions, but it will grow on you.

For the story, it is very straight forward that Lightning McQueen is attempted to go to California for the tiebreaker race.  However, during that time, he has to face a tough time when his delivery truck suddenly falls off and McQueen falls out of the truck and when he chases the truck back by speeding, he is caught by police and he has to do a community service and the time is against him too, he has to beat his pressure to secure a spot for that important race for him.  This story although is kind of easy to understand, it is basically good.  For the acting, they are all good.  For the direction, it is fantastic because all the scenes are logical.

Needless to say, I didn't rush out to see 'Cars' in the theater.  I only watched under duress on a long flight to Tokyo.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised...after a few minutes, I was hooked.  The plot in parts reminded me of a bad 80s movie starring Michael J. Fox, but it seemed to work  when acted out by talking cars.  I also have to say that I'm not the biggest fan of Larry the Cable Guy...Git R Done may have been funny the first time he said it....but, his tow truck character Mater was one of the more likeable and entertaining cars in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, a good animated film...probably the best I've seen since the first Shrek.",Cars

809091,B000H7I6CU, A3UV7L5ND3EH8T,5.0, Slick Movie With Lots of Heart,"My son and I watched Cars on the big screen and I LOVED it! The songs were perfect--especially Real Gone and Life is a Highway.<br /><br />I've just watched the movie again, twice, on DVD. Unfortunately, my 25 inch TV screen doesn't do this movie justice! (It's one of those movies that pack a wallop when watched on the big screen...)<br /><br />The realism achieved in this movie is amazing, especially with Lightning's shiny red paint job and the ""fumes"" rising from the drag cars. The writing is especially clever, too. (Look for the shapes in the rocky background at Radiator Springs.) For example, Harv, Lightning's fast-talking publicist/agent admonishes his client to get out of ""Radiation Stinks"" (you gotta hear it to appreciate it.)<br /><br />Every single time I watch this movie, I choke up twice during the last race. There are some critics who say that Cars doesn't have ""heart"" like Toy Story or other Pixar features. I can't help but wonder if we're talking about the same movie! I feel that Cars has more heart than ANY Pixar movie thus far--especially as it shows that winning isn't everything and that dignity is found in much more than an ""empty cup"" (like the Piston Cup).<br /><br />The voices in this movie are perfect, especially Owen Wilson as Lightning and Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. (Gosh, what a scene stealer that Mater is! And the funny thing is, if you watch the 16-minute ""Inspiration for Cars"" clip, you'll see the actual Mater--who sounds a lot like the character!)<br /><br />Speaking of the 16 minute Inspiration clip, I'm surprised that this DVD didn't have more extras--not even a commentary or movie video or sample story boards or anything! That was a disappointment, I admit. (I'm used to Disney packing the extras on there! Heck, I found out neat trivia bits--like why number 96 was chosen for Lightning's car--but I didn't find this out from the DVD!)<br /><br />However, the 16-minute clip was quite touching, especially hearing how the director was inspired for Cars. Turns out that he has several boys and his wife said to him one day: ""You know, we supported you through Toy Story 1 and 2 and your other projects...but one day, you'll wake up to find that your little boys are now off to college.""<br /><br />This sobering realization spurred him to take an entire summer off with his wife and kids--a road trip in a motor home. He said it was the best time of his life. Alas, he combined the two loves of his parents (his mother was an artist and his Dad was a car buff) to create the wonderful movie Cars, which also reflects his newfound wisdom: you can push, push, push for that next accomplishment, and one day realize that you're friendless or perhaps alone.<br /><br />There's also some great laughs in this movie; I LOVE the tractor-tipping scene with Mater and Lightning! (OMG--and that Frank is scary!)<br /><br />As I said, the extras are slim pickins:<br /><br />--New animated short Mater and the Ghostlight (Amusing. Fans of Mater will *especially* love this short!)<br /><br />--Academy Award-nominated animated short: One Man Band (This was the cute short about two deuling musicians fighting for a coin that a girl wants to throw into a fountain. It's the same short shown at the theater before the Cars movie.)<br /><br />--John Lasseter's inspiration for Cars (Very good. Inspirational in its own right.)<br /><br />--Ratatouille teaser trailer (A movie about a mouse in France with expensive tastes)<br /><br />--Deleted scenes<br /><br />This is an exceptional movie in terms of script, voice acting, music, authenticity, and animation. Car and racing lovers will no doubt love it, as will fans of Pixar. (Personally, I can't STAND car racing--or country music--but I loved both the soundtrack and the plot! Goes to show that one doesn't HAVE to be into cars to enjoy this movie.)",Cars

There he meets with many different types of cars. Some of them used to be big stars long time ago. As a result he discovers that fame, front covers, and spotlights do not last forever. On the other hand he discovers values that are long lasting such as true friendship and family.<br /><br />I want to make a special mention to the little italian blue forklift and yellow italian car named Guido and Luigi respectively. Their characters are the funniest in the movie. They will really make you laugh.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie as family entertainment.

809094,B000H7I6CU, A3IC8ZSANG7HAI,4.0, An instant classic,"Pixar movies are known for artistic achievements in the fields of computer animation; and for their accesible storytelling, which is even true at the film considered most ""adult"" by many audiences: The Incredibles.<br /><br />Many critics have panned ""Cars"" by calling it cliched and predictable, cheesy and formulaic. Yes, it might be cliched and predictable, it might have a lot of cheese and it follows the ""we-teach-you-sound-values"" formula. But then, why is it that this movie is striking a chord on many people? Maybe is it because we have precisely forgotten about these values?<br /><br />In this era and age of Instant Messaging, Blackberry, ""Date Movies"" and Tarantino gore, sometimes you welcome an effort like ""Cars"". You need to be reminded that we get so stuck in our own goals, our jobs, our careers and where we want to get, that we tend to forget what's important and to take a pause and enjoy all the blessings surrounding us. And that's the message this movie brings us, which is a lot deeper that the ""talking car"" facade might lead us to believe.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen is a hot-shot rookie in the world of stock car racing; he's so much into his own success and arrogance he has forgot the fact no one is an island. He will get a heavy dose of reality while being lost, finding Route 66, a forgotten town, love and friendship; while learning about a place that was scratched off the map because of so-called ""progress"".<br /><br />Sometimes a message like that is stronger if we take the context out of our own backgrounds and place them somewhere else. And that's precisely what Pixar does by bringing fantasy characters that have some credibility on them (talking cars that actually bend and move like real cars) to that context, while not forgetting the comedy and a lot of humor. So many jokes are there you'll need the DVD version to get them all.<br /><br />The soundtrack is dead on-target, from the rockin' ""Real Gone"" by Sheryl Crow, serving as an almost operatic introduction to McQueen to the teary ""Our Town"" by James Taylor and a nice version of ""Life is a Highway"" by Rascal Flatts.<br /><br />Yes, the movie is a bit long, but we in the audience at the theatre didn't really feel it; you won't help but feel identified with the characters: my girlfriend and I looked at some scenes in which McQueen and Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) were involved, and we saw ourselves reflected at those characters and personalities (Yes, I'm a tad cocky and career-oriented, sorry folks).<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Disney movies and I have entirely avoided animation pictures, including all of Pixar's previous efforts, except for The Incredibles on HBO. But something told me I should watch this one, and I am not disappointed. There must be something powerful about an animated movie that makes you put your life into a new perspective, and finish your day praying and thanking God for all the wonderful things you enjoy, most especially your family and friends.<br /><br />Life is indeed a journey, and there a lot of things to be enjoyed and learned while you get to your destination, including friendship and sportsmanship. And that message some people might call ""dated"" to be reflected in movies, is precisely the kind of message I'd like to bring and pass to my children, if I ever am blessed to have them.",Cars

809102,B000H7I6CU, A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,3.0, fantastic animation but too often stuck in neutral,"***1/2<br /><br />So who needs an opposable thumb when you can have a technologically advanced civilization built and inhabited by nothing but cars, trucks, vans and a whole host of other automotive vehicles?  ""Cars,"" the latest hit from Pixar Animation, presents a world entirely devoid of people but still replete with all the architecture, history and pop culture references we associate with human beings.  It's an intriguing concept, and one which the skilled animators bring to remarkable life on screen.  The vehicles that make up the cast of characters have been beautifully anthropomorphized without betraying their basic nature as transportation devices.  It's certainly a great deal easier for animators to imbue living creatures with human qualities than it is to do the same with automobiles, so the filmmakers are definitely to be commended for their stunning work in this movie (the breakthrough here is in putting the ""eyes"" in the dashboard rather than in the headlights, which gives the cars a friendlier, more expressive countenance than we are used to in animated-car tales).<br /><br />Owen Wilson voices the main character, Lightning McQueen, a self-absorbed, cherry-red racecar whose sole concern in life is to win the Piston Cup so he can bask in the glow of fame and fortune and rustle himself up a higher class of products to endorse.  While he's on his way to California for the Big Race, Lightning finds himself stranded in a small desert community named Radiator Springs - situated on old Route 66 - that lost all its business when the big interstate highway opened up a few miles outside of town.  The film is a sweet lament for a bygone era when crossing the country was a more laid-back affair and travelers were able to experience the joys of small town life on the way to their destinations.  It is in Radiator Springs that the cocky Lightning learns a thing or two from the townsfolk about what is really important in life (and it isn`t winning the big race).<br /><br />The town is filled with more quirky eccentrics than one would find in any low budget, independent feature shown at the Sundance Film Festival.  There's Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town`s medic and judge, who seems to be harboring a deep, dark secret about his past from the rest of the world; Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), a bucktoothed tow truck who's none too gifted in the brains department but who is sweet-tempered and good-natured and who becomes Lightning's most devoted follower in the town; Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), the sexy young Porsche who fled the rat race of civilization to make her home in Radiator Springs and who becomes the inevitable love interest for our hard-charging, drag racing Romeo.  There's also an assortment of ethnic types with thick accents to flesh out the scene and indicate what a melting pot even an America made up entirely of motor vehicles would be.  A large number of well-known voices populate the film, including Cheech Marin, George Carlin, Michael Keaton, Jeremy Piven, Jay Leno, Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Billy Crystal, John Goodman.  You name it - just about anyone who's anyone in Hollywood shows up in this movie.  Heck, even racing legends Richard Petty, Mario Andretti and Dale Earnhardt Jr. make an appearance here.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the color and animation are truly top drawer and state-of-the-art (this IS a Pixar product, after all), but, for all its richness of image and humor, ""Cars"" seems to be missing that extra added something that would secure it a place in the pantheon of great animated features.  Perhaps, there is a certain sameness built into the concept of having only animated vehicles as characters that makes the movie wear a bit thin after awhile.  Perhaps, too, the narrative needs a trifle more energy and ""drive"" (pardon the pun), a higher octane fuel that would make it speed along at a faster clip.  Lighting is stuck in this town for so long a spell that we begin to feel a little bit stuck there ourselves.  For a movie built entirely on driving, ""Cars"" is surprisingly sedentary for long stretches of time.  The one advantage animated movies have over live action films is that they are completely unbound by the laws of gravity, so there's really no excuse for any such film to ""drag"" (again, pardon the pun) in the way this one does.  There's a lyrical scene where Sally and Lightning envision what the town must have looked like in its pre-highway heyday, but so much of the middle section of the film is taken up with liquid dialogues and less-than-inspired slapstick routines that the movie often feels like it is caught in cruise control or stalling out altogether when what we really want is for it to race along at a breakneck speed worthy of its subject matter.  In short, the film probably would have been better had it used such anarchic chase movies as ""The Great Race,""  ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World"" or ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" as its source of inspiration.  Then, perhaps, more of the film would have been on a par, in terms of dynamism and excitement, with the astonishing racing sequence that closes the film.<br /><br />The movie pokes affectionate fun at the commercialization of racing, and there is no end to the clever punning that has gone into the naming of the characters and places that populate the film.  These, along with the stunning visuals, are enough to recommend the film for any viewer.  But, in the long run, I have to say that, for all its good qualities, ""Cars"" is too often stuck in neutral.",Cars

809121,B000H7I6CU, A3C6CZC2JP67VK,4.0, These cars are just too sweet!,"Criticism of this movie is a mystery to me. My kids has so far place this movie on there top ten mini lists. I have yet to see a bad Pixar film (even ""A Bug's Life"" is still entertaining, for kids anyway) and the only reason that I can think of is how difficult it is to follow a film of such real quality like ""The Incredibles"". I'm honestly struggling to think of a fault with this film which is bright, colourful, noisy and funny - perfect for the younger members of your family. But there is also more than enough for the adults to enjoy as well, not even mentioning the exceptionally high standard of animation and voice casting. ""Cars"" introduces us to a world where there are no people and cars are alive (and not just cars - helicopters, SUVs, tractors, you name it).<br /><br />Once you've adjusted yourself to the quirky world of ""Cars"" then you're in for a real treat. The first thing you notice is the epic scale of the thing and how wonderful it all looks. Whether it's crowded stands at a stadium or the timeless beauty of the Grand Canyon, Pixar provides further proof (if any were needed) that they are the new masters of animation. Everything is bright and full of colour and life and after a while, you even forget that you're watching a cartoon altogether! I thought that a new standard had been reached in animation with ""The Incredibles"" but this looks even better than that. The voice casting is also superb, as always, with Newman and Wilson leading a cast of real quality. Even finding Jeremy Clarkson and Michael Schumacher in cameos was a real blast, although American audiences probably would have enjoyed (and recognised) Jay Leno or Mario Andretti a bit more. Some characters maybe weren't as defined as others - low-rider Ramone (Cheech Marin) and 50's cruiser Flo (Jenifer Lewis) weren't as defined as others and didn't feel part of the story - but with so much on screen (especially during the race sequences), it's easy to lose some aspects of the film in the noise and spectacle.<br /><br />The dialogue is littered with one-liners while references and in-jokes abound (Lightning's tyre, for example, are called ""Lightyears""). The pace of the movie also fitted the story - fast and loud at the start, slow and quiet in Radiator Springs - and the whole thing is filled with the typically enthusiastic imagination that Pixar infuse their pictures with. However, for all of the technical brilliance of ""Cars"", I still prefer ""The Incredibles"" - it's more fun and doesn't sag in the middle as much as this did. But ""Cars"" is still a wonderful film and one that appears to have been underrated already by certain other critics. Don't listen to them - this is a family film of genuine class and quality and you'll be missing out if you don't watch it. Vroom-vroom!",Cars
809122,B000H7I6CU, AB1UMC7SB9D7Z,5.0, Better than ever and as good as always,"Man, I cannot believe Pixar.  I felt they were going to start to slip when they released The Incredibles and I thought it was just another superhero movie, when it turned out to be an exploration of discovering your identity and knowing who you are and what you can do.  Then I thought Cars looked kind of uninteresting and reviews that called it derivative didn't help.  However, though this movie may be a bit derivative, it still is a huge helping of Pixar heart.<br /><br />Everything about this movie exceeded my expectations.  I thought I'd hate the characters, especially Lightning and Mader because Lightning is selfish and Mader is voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, but I ended up really liking both (and all of the other characters too).  I didn't believe Pixar could have made their animation even more stunning, but they did, both with high technological neon lighting animation and gorgeous natural vistas.  Heck, I thought the movie would feel preachy, but it still feels very caring.<br /><br />It's also a slight return to form after the Incredibles in that it returns to homages of cinema past and tie-ins to other Pixar works, something that is both fun to look for and shows how much the crew working at Pixar really love their job.  These films are still really magnificent and I can't wait for Ratatouille coming in 2007.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB",Cars
809123,B000H7I6CU, A3M2WW0PO34B94,4.0, How Long Before They Change the Name to Pixarland?,"4 and 1/2<br /><br />I will never, for the life of me, understand why Michael Eisner, the former head of Disney, even entertained the notion of ending Disney's relationship with Pixar. Disney's recent animated efforts pale in comparison to Pixar's. For proof of this, take a look at the Disney theme parks; Pixar characters are everywhere, in rides, as characters meeting the public, in parades, in shows. You would be hard pressed to find any representation from ""Treasure Planet"", ""Chicken Little"" or ""Hercules"". You might see Chicken Little doing a `Character Meet and Greet', but that's about it. Disney needs Pixar. And vice versa. No other movie studio has a marketing machine geared towards and a reputation for family films.<br /><br />The two are a match made in heaven.<br /><br />When you produce such consistently great films, as Pixar does, it becomes necessary to rate them against themselves. There is no other scale; they have raised the bar too high. Rating ""Cars"" on the same scale as DreamWorks's ""Over the Hedge"" just isn't going to work. ""Hedge"" is good, but Pixar films are in a class by themselves. It becomes a matter of is it ""Toy Story/ The Incredibles"" good or simply ""Monsters, Inc"" good? ""The Incredibles"" and the ""Toy Story"" films represent modern examples of perfection in the art of animation. For that matter, there are few live action films that can compare. ""A Bug's Life"" and ""Monsters, Inc"" are both very good, but they aren't perfect. ""Cars"", the newest film from Pixar, with the voice talents of Paul Newman, Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt and John Ratzenberger, is very good, but it's ""Monsters, Inc."" good. It isn't perfect.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a rookie car on the Piston Cup circuit, has the moves and attitude to win the Cup, upsetting the King (Richard Petty), the veteran in his last race, and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), the venerable also-ran determined to win. After a three-way tie, the cars head out to California to perform for the title. Lightning upsets his third pit crew of the year, all of whom quit, and he sets off to California with simply his truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). Lightning pressures Mack to drive through the night and along the way, Lightning gets separated and lost. He ends up in Radiator Springs, a sleepy little town on Route 66, far off the interstate. Disoriented, Lightning causes some damage and Sally (Bonnie Hunt), a Porsche, who lives in the town wants to see the damage repaired, pressuring Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town's judge, to order Lightning to fix the road before he leaves. Determined to get to California, Lightning tries to fulfill his duty but gets distracted by the residents of Radiator Springs.<br /><br />Directed by John Lasseter (""Toy Story"" and its sequel), ""Cars"" is a beautiful, richly detailed look at a world where cars live just like humans. Nearly great, the film has many things going for it and one key thing working against it.<br /><br />Both a brilliant idea for an animated film and a brilliant marketing concept, ""Cars"" has a lot going for it. With NASCAR gaining popularity every week, this animated effort seems guaranteed to receive some cross-over. Also, how quickly can they retrofit the Speedway attractions at the theme parks? Let's freshen those babies up.<br /><br />From the opening scenes, depicting a race at the Motor Speedway of the South, the computer generated animation is flawless in design and detail. Really, the only detail telling us this film is animated is the faces on the cars. Beyond that, the scenery and production design are flawless. We believe we are watching a real race at a real speedway (complete with cars filling the stands, doing the wave, and RVs parked in the center of the track) and the scenes of Lightning speeding through the landscape look like they were filmed, the landscapes appear so real I could almost smell the pine trees and the desert wind blowing across the open plain. The shots of Lightning and Sally driving through the forest are simply stunning. When they visit Ornament Valley, the rocks are beautiful and look like hood ornaments. When the race car arrives at Radiator Springs, the filmmakers have created a loving tribute to the little towns, motels, businesses, tourist attractions and icons which used to dot Route 66 during its heyday.<br /><br />All of the cars are created with loving detail, each based on an actual car or vehicle. Even the car governor of California is a Hummer with an Austrian accent. Lightning is a race car, I'm going to guess a Mustang, I couldn't quite identify him, but Porsches, Ferraris, Buicks, Hudson Hornets and more, both old and new, make an appearance.<br /><br />The voice talents are, as always, exceptional. Owen Wilson brings the right blend of cocky upstart and guts to Lightning McQueen.  When he eventually realizes what his life is missing, and what he needs to do to fix it, we believe it. Paul Newman is perfect as Doc Hudson, the elder statesman of Radiator Springs. Once a powerful, cocky star in his own right, he prefers the quiet life in his little town. I read Newman, car buff that he is, suggested his character's make and model, giving Doc Hudson even more detail. He also has the right amount of gravelly intonation for a car fifty plus years old; you can imagine the carburetor adding to Doc's voice, in much the way Newman's voice adds resonance to the character. Hunt is good as the Porsche looking to protect and preserve the town and its inhabitants. Larry the Cable Guy is amusing as Tom Mater, the tow truck who is a few spark plugs short of a full engine. Tony Shalhoub plays Luigi, a little Italian car who runs the local tire shop and is obsessed with all things Ferrari. A number of real-life race car drivers make cameos as their cars and Tom and Ray, the Car Talk Guys from NPR, play the owners of Lightning's poorly funded sponsors.<br /><br />I have to give a lot of credit to Pixar. They could've so easily made the race cars even more realistic and covered them with real sponsors, much like the real thing. Thankfully, we are spared from watching endless logos for Home Depot and the like. Instead, all of the sponsors are fictional, and provide a level of humor to the tale. Lightning's sponsors are Rust-Eze, the rear bumper rust lubricant. He longs to be sponsored by Dinoco, a large oil company. Get it? Dinoco, large oil company. Dinosaurs. Oil. Chick (Keaton) is sponsored by HTB, Hostile Takeover Bank. These are cute jokes, some of which are worked into the story, providing another level of detail to an already richly observed universe.<br /><br />The problem with ""Cars"" is pacing. The film seems long and ten or fifteen minutes edited out middle would've improved the film greatly, giving it a faster rhythm, making it nearly unforgettable. As it is, the middle drags and we begin to fidget in our seats a bit.<br /><br />""Cars"" is fun, amusing and brilliantly designed. Sure to provide amusement for everyone in the family. As I have said many times, the mark of a classic animated film is it entertains the kids as well as the adults who have to take them. Would it entertain just adults? I heard a lot of laughter from adults, and a lot of laughter from the kids. At times a chorus, at others one group could be heard over the other. I can't imagine a better family film until maybe the next Pixar release, in summer, 2007, ""Ratatouile"", about a rat trying to eat good food in Paris.",Cars

Since I have been a movie addict since I was a teenager many years ago, that is pretty strong stuff. I think the Pixar team outdid themselves on this movie, and I've loved every one they've released previously. The animation is fantastic (machines as people?), the scenery is breathtaking, the story and subplots are rich and well-done and the characters are believable and endearing. The storyline brings alive to the American public the way our desire to ""save ten minutes"" has essentially destroyed the towns and businesses along Route 66 at the same time destroying the values and innocence of a period in our recent history when family and neighbors were the strength of our nation. This is not a nostalgia piece so much as it is a wake-up call to what we have left behind in our cellphone/internet/instant-everything/lowest price/high tech/do-it-now society.

One reoccurring negative in their reel reign (aside from their contractual obligations and burden of partnership w/ DISNEY) was those darn humans. From Andy and his family to the very stylized characters of their last outstanding outing ""The Incredibles"" those probamatic people seem to be holding the studio back from the Zen of true animated perfection. The award-winning ""Finding Nemo"" has Spartan servings of those CGI simians and ""A Bug's Life"" none at all. So now with ""CARS"" Pixar has not only eliminated the humans, but also the human form. Sure the cars in CARS are anthropomorphized, that's a given, otherwise it's a HERBIE movie or Knight Rider without the Hasslehoff. This project is more akin to the claymation CHEVRON commercials of the 90's from AARDMAN ANIMATIONS. The imagery is hard to shake, but maybe that's a plus, not a minus, `cause most of us loved those guys and, I think, most of us will love these guys too.<br /><br />Pixar has outdone itself again with this one, the animation is flawless, the opening of the movie immerses us in the NASCAR-like track series: Dinoco's ""Piston Cup (Dinoco a Toy Story reference, as is the tires and the blimps, they're ""Lightyears"" of course) in a world where cars are both cars and people. The graphics at the race are absolute perfection, slamming the screen with racing commentary, stats and glitter. The race itself looks as if it were filmed for IMAX, beautiful!! Accept cars just can't bend and move like that, let alone emote and express the seemingly limitless range of expressions and attitudes these car can. Pixar has really outdone themselves!<br /><br />The story is the only thing that isn't exceptional about the movie, it is archetypical racing fare. The young ""oh-too-full-of-himself rookie"" LIGHTNING MCQUEEN (voice perfectly by Owen Wilson) has a hard lesson to learn about treating others and that he really does need friends. Already at the films opening, his disregard for others nearly costs him the race, but he manages a tie, a three-way-tie with CHICK HICKS, a ruthless competitor and The King, a racing legend (voiced by real legend Richard Petty). Immediately ignoring advise from the King that would have saved him a lot of trouble, enroute to the tie-breaker for the Cup Lightning loses his way finding himself in the town of Radiator Springs, and in trouble. While repairing the road-damage he caused he meets an ensemble of unlikely, yet inevitable friends who teach him the lessons he so desperately needs. (Tow-)Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's best friend, Sally (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) is a Porshe who charms Lightning, then there's Doc Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman). Doc, serves as Radiator Springs doctor (mechanic), Judge, and he also serves as Lightning's archetypical mentor. The old 1951 Hudson Hornet who was a famous 3 time-Cup winner himself gives Lightning McQueen more than just advise, he gives the rookie racer an insight into the real spirit of racing and a Shakespearean themed notion of how to remain true to yourself. Everntually McQueen makes it to his Tie-breaker, but his heart isn't in it without his new friends. I won't tell you who wins the cup or how, but true to the archetype, McQueen's mentor shows up to guide him  through the race. This clich&#65533; is not only one we've seen before in the race genre, but as recently as this year in Disney's Herbie Fully-Loaded. That's okay it still has solid impact just this one more time.<br /><br />Pixar's voice-casting as always is top-notch, Owen Wilson is the quintessential hotshot, I mean it is his bread & butter in front of the camera. Larry ""TCG""  as Mater is his classic good ol' boy that keeps him in flannels. Paul Newman as Doc, what a terrific and moving job the 79 yea old does, bringing so much to such a small part, amazing! Also superb comic characterizations from Tony Shalhoub (Monk) as the Italian tire-shop owner and Fiat 500 and classic George Carlin as a classic VW burned out hippie van. And YES! John Ratzenburger is in CARS! The Pixar ""good luck charm"" himself John Ratzenburger, who voices a character in ALL of the Pixar/Disney releases in back in this one too as Mack! If you sit through the credits, as always with Pixar, you will get a treat, this time specifically poking fun a past works and the actor. Also, bless you Pixar for getting the ""CAR TALK"" brothers ""Click & Clack"" on board, they so needed to advice us not to ""drive like my brother."" Great!<br /><br />Cars is the first feature since TOY STORY 2 to have co-founder / executive producer John Lasseter direct and it isn't a disappointment. This may be Pixar's best work to date; it is definitely the best film so far of the summer of '06.  The only weak link here is the obligatory sentimental music montage, that each of Lasseter's works have. This one tells or rather shows the story of how Radiator Springs fell by the wayside off route 66, maybe little too awkwardly setting up Sally's desire to see the town returned to its former glory, which an hour and 55 minutes later, it is. The music there and overall, could be stronger, lots of road refs, okay but that's really my only complaint. I still say, go take a second lap, you'll need to see it twice, in order to catch all the little jokes.",Cars

Their storys have heart.  A lot of heart.  And yes, their animination is second to none.  Cars is no different.  I'm not huge into Nascar, but this movie appeals on so many levels, there's something for everyone in it.  I won't rehash the plot here.  Trust me, it's very good.

My friend was talking about how great the movie was. I was basically getting tired of the same line of up of characters in the movies, talking animals, abandoned animals, ,etc. The hype about this movie was another factor in whether or not I was going to take my child to see it. It appeared that every one was trying to ride on the Car's band wagon, with so many companies trying to profit from it, it's a wonder if the movie was any good.<br /><br />I was floored, the movie was awesome, I am a grown woman and cannot WAIT until it is released to DVD so I can watch it over (and over and over) again with my son.<br /><br />The characters were perfectly aligned together to make an all-star cast, there is no need in making a part two, I see no way that you can top this one!",Cars

809132,B000H7I6CU, AUHG8KSHI529U,4.0," A good family film, but somehow we expect more than good from Pixar","Well, maybe something got past me because I am not a NASCAR devotee, but this one seemed pretty much an ordinary ""fish out of water"" story with few twists or turns or delights.  It isn't that it is bad.  In fact, it is even enjoyable to watch with kids.  However, it just didn't have any ""wow"" factor.<br /><br />The look is pretty good and some of the cars are even dazzling (if preposterous) to look at.  However, the story of the selfish young hotshot having to basically lose it all, but then learning about friends who pull him through is quite old.  It is a useful story for kids to learn (and adults who didn't learn the lesson as kids), but somehow I wanted Pixar magic to kick it into overdrive - to use some Nitro.  But it just sort of plodded along.<br /><br />The voices were all good.  Why Paul Newman is there becomes clear in the second half of the movie.  Owen Wilson puts in the right amount of ego with enough humanity to learn as the star ""Lightning McQueen"" (will that name seem cool to anyone who doesn't know Steve McQueen?  McQueen???).  Bonny Hunt is good as Sally Carrera.  And Tony Shaloub and Cheech Martin are fine color characters.  Especially fine, I would say.<br /><br />But do we really need Larry the Cable Guy as Tow Mater?  Isn't that awfully - well, awful?  It isn't that I hated them going out tractor tipping, or Mater showing McQueen some moves that McQueen didn't understand, but a buck toothed hick?  Who thought that was witty?  Let them know it wasn't.<br /><br />The bit with John Ratzenberger over the credits was quite well done and shows the kind of sparkle that I wish had been in the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Still, a pretty good movie.  Just not up to the standards we expect from Pixar.",Cars

Especially appreciate the silence at the Rust Eze after party when someone shouts ""FREEBIRD"".....

809135,B000H7I6CU, A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,4.0, Charming and Smart,"The beginning of Cars is a little lame since the beginning race goes on a little too long and it's not either very entertaining or funny. The main car voiced by Owen Wilson isn't that likeable in the beginning. He's self-centered and cocky. The movie gets better when he  gets stuck in a small town and forced to fix a wrecked road there if he wants to leave. If he doesn't leave soon he will miss out being in a big race and becoming the big star he wants to be. The longer he's stuck there though the more he finds that he likes it there and the more he learns to be less self-centered. He also learns to care about other people.....oops, I mean other cars.<br /><br />  At first I only found Cars to be a great movie to look at and nothing else. Then I got more and more into the story and I soon found it to be as good as other big Disney Pixar hits like Toy Story 1 and 2 and The Incredibles and Finding Nemo. Cars is a smart, charming and sometimes even a touching film. Disney missed out for being nominated last year for best animated film ""thanks to Chicken Little being pretty weak"". Cars hopefully won't get ignored when it comes to Oscar time. It looks great and doesn't have a bad story either. The voice actors casted are perfect too. Owen Wilson, Paul Newman and Bonnie Hunt all do fine jobs.",Cars

809137,B000H7I6CU, AUSATFDSU2INS,4.0," Cars is about the journey, not the destination","The Pixar team has infinite creative brain cells. They are an always-in-evolution machine, capable of providing us with the most unimaginable but amazing stories. Every Pixar movie is an exercise in universe creation, and Cars is not an exception.<br /><br />This is a world populated entirely by automobiles. No drivers, passengers or people; their windshields are eyes, their grills are mouths.<br /><br />The protagonist is a hotshot rookie race car named Lightning McQueen, an arrogant who thinks he doesn't need anyone but himself to conquer the world (and some trophy called The Piston Cup). With him, we get very early, that this is the story of how McQueen will learn what's really important in life.<br /><br />""Cars"" is about enjoying the journey, not getting fast to the destination.<br /><br />While McQueen is on his way to the final showdown in California, he gets lost and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs where he gets sentenced to community service. Eventually, the hotshot befriends the ""weird"" locals, who will teach him exactly what he needs to learn; the importance of having friends to support you, the loveliness and charm of small-town values and the most important one: how shallow and meaningless are the notions of fame and prestige.<br /><br />That a coveted trophy is -after all- ""just an empty cup"".<br /><br />Cars have that Pixar/Disney charm and good vibe, but it doesn't capture the emotional resonance offered in their past films. The animation looks amazing, showing us how vast and unforgettable the world can be. It's good and it entertains. It has heart and spunk. But it's just not enough. Maybe it's because the storyline is not that original, maybe it's something else. But it's certainly a lovely movie, and one hell of a ride.",Cars

Not me, and honestly I went into this movie with low expectations, despite the fact that so many Pixar movies are so well done. Well, boy was I surprised.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie was much like I expected the entire movie to be..loud and fast, with so much going on onscreen you can't keep track of it all. But the movie switches tone and pacing when the star racecar ends up (by accident) in the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, with a bunch of good-ol-boy cars who haven't heard of the Piston Cup and just want to bring their little town back to its heydey glory.<br /><br />Larry the Cable Guy steals the show as Mater, the tow truck who befriends the self-centered racecar and inadvertently helps to teach him the value of teamwork and putting others before yourself.<br /><br />Overall a great movie and I don't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",Cars

When I see this movie, I think of the genius behind it.  Some say that hope is lost in America, well, this movie is one of hope, one of coming of age, one of learning to consider where you are headed in life.<br /><br />What got me the most was the spontaneous applause at the end of the movie, the whole audience just suddenly errupted with applause, I have not experienced such a joyful reaction from an audience in a long time.  Not that it is a cartoon, it sends a message, one of friendship and one of turning your life around from selfishness to learning to be a friend.<br /><br />The message to me is that it may only take one person to turn around the lives of many.

809140,B000H7I6CU, A2NJO6YE954DBH,4.0," Not firing on all pistons, but Pixar's ""Cars"" is still fine family enteratinment for the summer of 2006","""Cars"" may well be the least of the Pixar animated films put out by Disney, in which case the future of computer animated films remains exceedingly bright.  The story starts with the final race for the Piston Cup, in which rookie Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) is tied with The King (Richard Petty) and bad car Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) for the lead.  The arrogance of youth costs Lightning the race and the three way tie requires one more race a week later in California for the title and the lucrative endorsement.  But on the way there Lightning get separated from Mack (John Ratzenberger), the big rig in which he travels, and ends up making the mistake of speeding through the town of Radiation Springs.  So instead of preparing for the big race, he is doing community service in a town that has been bypassed by the Interstate and all but forgotten.<br /><br />Radiation Springs, of course, is filled with all sorts of interesting cars.  Lightning is arrested by the Sheriff (Michael Wallis), and sentenced to repair the road by Doc Hudson (Paul Newman in a masterstroke of casting), at the insistence of Sally Careera (Bonnie Hunt), who runs the motel and is also the city attorney.  Mater the tow truck (Larry the Cable Guy) becomes Lightning's new friend and teaches him the joys of midnight tractor tipping, while Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) wants to sell him tires.  There is also Flo (Jenifer Lewis) at the diner, and Sarge the Jeep (Paul Dooley) and Filmore the VW Bus (George Carlin) from the 60s rubbing each other the wrong way.  There is also a tin Lizzie (Kathrine Helmond), who still remembers when the place was founded by Stanley the Steamer.  There are a series of lessons that Lightning needs to learn, and this film goes through all of them right by the numbers.  Things might get a bit predictable, but there is a nice surprise at the end when Lightning puts winning in its proper place, so the little kids are clearly ahead of the game at the end of this one.<br /><br />More than what has come before it this is a Pixar film that speaks to adults, who are in a much better sense to appreciate the sense of loss the film tries to represent with the forgotten city of Radiator Springs (although I have to admit that it reminded me a bit of the abandoned town in the recent remake of ""House of Wax"").  This is a move about cars, but it is also once that celebrates the past and the wonders of nature as well as what fast driving machine can do.  Plus, this is a film that has Bonnie Hunt be a Porsche, which is certainly a bit of type casting that only us older folks can appreciate.  Final Note: The name of Lightning McQueen is apparently a reference to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died in 2002, but it also clearly resonates in terms of Steve McQueen, whose legendary car driving in ""Bullitt"" is still well remembered.",Cars

After all, THE INCREDIBLES nearly smothered one with advertising, and it turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time!  But, I was proved wrong.  As soon as the first black screen of the movie showed, my doubts and fears were alleviated.  PIXAR still has a whole lot left in them, and will for many, many years.  This movie is clever, interesting, and more and more it seems to be the kind of breather I need to get away from all of the crude humor and cheap, cruel laughs that most movies resort to nowadays.<br /><br />If you want to see a good movie, just skip Over the Hedge and go watch Cars.

Insightful and delightful, the film offers up the coming-of-age of Lightning McQueen, the rookie racecar that's tearing up the tracks and hot on the trail of the magnificent Piston Cup.  However, Lightning manages to derail himself by alienating his pit crew and talking his truck transport into driving all night and getting him lost in the middle of the desert somewhere along Route 66, the highway that used to be the byway to the western United States.  But that's where the story begins.  Lightning has to make restitution for tearing up the town, and along the way he ends up making friends that enrich and give meaning to his life.<br /><br />Pixar Studios is absolutely the crown jewel of the animated studios.  A lot of new faces are showing up in that market, but no one else even comes close to what Pixar can serve up.  Beginning with TOY STORY and moving through MONSTERS, INC., A BUG'S LIFE (which are lampooned in the end credits of CARS) and including the INCREDIBLES, Pixar has held unchallenged sway over animated movies.<br /><br />CARS has one of the oldest plots in storytelling.  Young upstart with the world by the tail gets taught a new lesson about the real meaning of life.  Scores of movies have used that as their baseline to tell a tale.  Yet, somehow -- probably because Pixar is just filled with magic, CARS pulls off an exciting feel-good reindition of what is probably the most hackneyed of plots.  Owen Wilson stars as the voice of Lightning, Paul Newman as Doc, Bonnie Hunt as Sally, Larry the Cable Guy as Mater, Cheech Marin as Ramon, Michael Keaton as Chick Hicks and Richard Petty as the King.  All of the characters were great.  The world invented in this movie, where cars with personalities exist but people don't, comes across realistically portrayed (given the circumstances -- and viewers have to wonder where little cars come from and how they got invented).  The tractor tipping sequence Mater takes Lightning on is a hoot.<br /><br />This movie is a must out there in the theaters.  Children and adults will have a great time.  The only thing that's going to be better will be the DVD with all the special features showing how Pixar wove their latest magic spell.",Cars
809144,B000H7I6CU, A3E832FY3AIKFT,5.0, Pixar's Seventh Heaven?,"So, will this make Pixar's run of excellent films seven for seven? Undoubtably.<br /><br />Early signs however were not good. Although the release date was moved from last fall to this summer (not usually a good omen) this seems to have been more a desire for the makers to 'polish the chrome' even more than it already was. With Pixar having such a strong reputation, they needn't rush out their product to compete in the now almost saturated market.<br /><br />Other bad vibes came in the form of the trailers. The teaser was pretty poor, not anything like the great ones for Monsters Inc or The Incredibles (excluding visuals which were enough to get most of our motors revving). Then the first theatrical trailer seemed to pitch the film squarely at 'motor-heads' with some pretty obscure car-based references.<br /><br />Of all of Pixar's films so far, this probably has the least universal appeal, at least on the face of it. I doubt whether many little girls will want to rush and see it (I may be being a little sexist here and I apologise) but this may be made up for with the amount of grown-men that will surely queue around the block.<br /><br />From here on, Pixar are now part of Disney instead of partnered with them and I sincerely hope that Pixar's knowledge rubs off onto Disney's flagging animation department.",Cars

Disney/Pixar has once again produced a terrific animated film.  Race fans will love it and need to watch closely for the parallels to NASCAR.  Those of you who have been to the infield for a race at Charlotte will like the Redneck Hill reference.  The stars turned out for the premier and Disney donated $1 million dollars split between Paul Newman's Hole in the Wall Gang Camps and Speedway Charities, which includes Kyle Petty's Victory Junction Camp.  The characters in this film are loveable.  Paul Newman's 1951 Hudson Hornet is a small town judge and nobody in town knows about his checkered (flag) past.  Owen Wilson lends his voice to the main character Lightning McQueen.  Fans will fall in love with him.  Bonny Hunt is wonderful as the pretty Porche, Sally befriending Lighning in his journey through Radiator Springs.  John Ratzenberger again lends his talent to another supporting character in a Disney film. Don't leave before the credits to see additional work by John.  Tony Shaloub (Mr. Monk) plays Luiggi an Italian tire store owner and Ferrari lover.  Darrell Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., and Michael Schumacher also make voice appearances in the film.  If you are a race fan you will love it.  If you are not, there are enough aspects of the film not revolving around racing for you to enjoy it.  Kids will love it and parents prepare for the onslaught of marketing that will have them wanting all things cars.  I willingly purchased 2 items today for my kids as I loved this wholesome family film.  GO SEE THE MOVIE!!!  I am eagerly awaiting the soundtrack.  Brad Paisley has 2 songs in the movie.

To date, she had only enough attention span to stick with a 20 or 30 minute cartoon, but she held out to watch this entire movie. I wanted to rent it before buying to see whether it would actually hold her interest. It did! Good movie! My daughter also is very sensitive with any movie involving any person (cartoon person) or animal in the midst of any conflict or danger, but she managed not to get too emotionally involved since cars are the obvious source of all the drama in this movie. :)",Cars

I just can not uderstand some of very critical (and mean) reviews below - I loved this movie and, more important, my daughter loved it too.

Pixar, similar to Toy Story, puts heavy duty race cars in a human light -- not one character in the movie is human.  Lighting McQueen an arrogant, rookie race car is aiming to win The Piston Cup.  If he wins he'!l get a major endorsement and be one of the elite cars of all of racing!  However because of his arrogance and his lack of respect for people in the field of racing, he finds himself friendless. So happens, his life takes a dramatic turn as he is lead into a run down town by the name of Radiator Spring off Route 66.  He meets a several fellow town's cars, especially those that help impact him in a positive light as it reaches it's climax.  The amination of the film is creative and brillant use of color.  The sound is vibrant as you really feel like you are on a race track or driving down a highway.  The voices are pretty good, my favorite of course is from the late Paul Newman who plays Doc Hudson.  For what it's worth the movie is terrific!  It is definetly a family movie and Pixar once more proves their excellence in pictures by using cars to tell fun, thoughtful, and real storytelling.",Cars

809198,B000H7I6CU, A27H9DOUGY9FOS,3.0," Like A Typical Race, A Pleasant ""Cars"" Follows A Very Routine And Expected Track","I really wanted to love ""Cars"" when it came out! Trust me, I did. While many think I may be cold and emotionless and it's quite unfashionable to be critical of this movie, I had actually been incredibly impressed by Pixar's track record prior to this film. ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""The Incredibles"" are all film I would have rated among the best in their respective years. And ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" are astute crowd pleasers that tug at your heartstrings.<br /><br />But, alas, I was a bit let down with ""Cars."" It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It just might have been a tad too calculated for its own good, and for the first time--the emotion seemed too manufactured. I never cared about the plight of our automobile friends in the same way as I did for the toys, the fish and the superhero family. With a plot as obvious as this, so linear and expected in every way--maybe the movie's heart never connected with me because their was no ""real"" drama or surprise. Everything proceeds just as you know it will.<br /><br />""Cars"" is a great looking movie as you would expect. The visuals are fun and colorful. The soundtrack is great--the sound effects and ambient music are crisp and spot on. Layering in known songs like ""Life Is A Highway"" actually enliven the film far more than the few original tunes that unfortunately play as cliche. The cast is game. Owen Wilson's distinctive voice lends great amusement and Paul Newman is terrific. There are moments of genuine humor and great laughs--come on, tractor tipping is classic.<br /><br />Then why, oh why, am I so apathetic about this film? Ultimately, I've just seen this formula before--it's too predictable. Is it still a movie worth seeing? Sure. Might the kids love it? Sure. But it's missing the heart and genuineness of Pixar's earlier works. Oh, it still has all the emotional elements in place--but here they just don't ring true. Never once, after viewing ""Cars,"" did I remember it fondly. It was gone just as soon as I'd seen it. Pleasantly entertaining in the now, ""Cars"" just doesn't have the same enduring appeal as I'd have liked. KGHarris, 11/06.",Cars

809211,B000H7I6CU, A3NKFB39AIEN8W,5.0, Cool ride!,"Saw Cars 2 earlier this week and I am in the minority it seems who actually liked it almost as much as the first film. After checking out Cars last night, I'll amend what I said about Cars 2 being as good and admit that Cars had a more focused storyline and was also a little funnier.<br /><br />In a nutshell, a little red race car named Lightning McQueen has issues, particularly he's selfish, narcissistic, and doesn't need a pit crew. A mishap en route to California's Piston Cup to settle a 3 way tiebreaker lands him in a lazy southwest desert town occupied by old forgotten automobiles where McQueen learns that the universe doesn't revolve around him and that sometimes we all need to slow down and smell the roses.<br /><br />Immediate impressions can be deceiving. From not having seen this film in a few years I thought its age would show against the sequel but this wasn't the case as this film still looks and sounds equally as beautiful and powerful as its successor. In my Cars 2 review I said that it looked superior to this film but seeing them side by side I'd have to take that back. Some say that this film is shallow compared to Pixar's other films but I disagree. Also, a big kudos to the characters in this film. What I mean is that the cars match the personalities they embody perfectly. Hudson, the big Buick with the big chrome grill behaves exactly how it looks, as does ol' rusty bucktoothed Mater, and my favorites Guido (Volkswagen) and Luigi (forklift). This is a great film and one that I'd rank with some of my favorite live action car films.",Cars

We moved into a new, furnished house recently and put our old dvd player in storage. Unfortunately, our copy of ""Cars"" was in it at the time and rendered inaccessible for the moment.  I purchased this copy because we just couldn't do without it. My son asks for it every day.  Naturally I've seen it a thousand times at this point, but even though it's not my favorite Pixar film, it is still pretty great and it holds up to multiple viewings. The story is good (as is always the case with Pixar), there are lots of little extra touches (look for the VW ""bugs"" on the flourescent lights), and even my two year old gets excited about the race scenes.<br /><br />I like that the BluRay combo has a regular DVD as well, because when we get our BluRay player out of storage, we can use that, but for now the regular DVD works too, and it means we really have three copies:  the one stuck in our old player, and these two.

Since I like to follow the races myself, I chose to watch it too. Besides being an enjoyable movie on the surface, it's a movie with a message that can teach the value of teamwork vs. trying to go it alone--something all of us need to learn while we are young. It's the kind of movie that deserves repeated watching.<br /><br />I have read a number of books on leadership this year. I'll just mention one that speaks about teamwork, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N6VVFM"">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Unabridged on 5 CDs [5 Dysfunctions</a>], a ""leadership fable"" that focuses on the characteristics directly opposed to the building blocks which the author claims are essential for teamwork to develop. These five dysfunctions are absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results.<br /><br />You can see some of this at work in this movie. I believe you can see also the reversal of some form of these at work as the movie progresses. You see that it takes the development of interpersonal relationships and personal goals to overcome obstacles that are necessary to make teams work--to make us team players. These are not insignificant qualities for our children to acquire. We all want them to be successful. These are not trivialized by successful persons. A great plus is: it's all presented in an understandable format within the context of something that is simply good entertainment enjoyed by many of us.<br /><br />Very enjoyable and instructional!",Cars

809227,B000H7I6CU, AHF97M45JFCB,4.0, Still Charming Half a Decade Later,"I don't know about you but when I think of Pixar's ""classics"" rarely is Cars the first to come to mind.  The Toy Story(s) perhaps, Monsters Inc. maybe, even Finding Nemo for those so inclined and yet it took a under-whelming sequel followed by a revisit to the DVD I thought I knew well to realize that the first Cars is the epitome of all that Pixar has come to mean to modern animation.<br /><br />In the event that you've been living in a cave these past six years, Cars tells of a racecar sidetracked by fate on his way to The Big Race in California.  Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a brash NASCAR rookie who unwittingly gets lost and ends up in Radiator Springs, an almost-ghost town and former hot spot along historic Route 66, now ignored by tourists and travelers alike, thanks to the superhighway that bypasses the town.<br /><br />In the process of arriving, McQueen inadvertently tears up the asphalt of Main Street.  He gets arrested and is sentenced, against will and ego, to repave the damaged street.<br /><br />While paying his debt to society, McQueen encounters a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a rusty but lovable tow truck, a hippy 1960 VW bus, a classy but confident Porsche and a herd of tractors prone to tipping over and fluctuating exhaust fumes out of fright.<br /><br />The racing action certainly gets its due to be sure and kids have proven that a ragtag group of vehicles with eyes behind their windshields works just fine as toys, school folders, and backpacks.  But it is John Lasseter's underlying message that couldn't be clearer here: Pay attention to what matters: family, friends, true love, and it doesn't hurt to appreciate cars either.<br /><br />NASCAR-fans had much to celebrate, as did car-racing aficionados of all disciplines for that matter but it's the nostalgia of society's collective switch in thinking (from the scenery of iconic Route 66 being traded for the efficiency of the superhighway) that I found most prolific this time around.<br /><br />Even though 2006 might as well be eons ago in the ever-advancing world of computer animating technology, the visuals in Cars still manage to impress (especially in high-definition); a fact perhaps further enhanced by the abundance of heart within the prose.<br /><br />In all, and contrary to the trend that Pixar just continues to outdo itself in each subsequent effort, it is almost ironic that having watched the lackluster sequel in the theater led me back to the original and of course to rediscovering the charms that separate the good films from the great ones.",Cars

I grew up with them, and AM a grown-up that still loves them.<br /><br />That being said, I was very disappointed with a slew of movies released by the company in the late 90's and into the early 00's.  They seemed empty, mere gimmicks for marketing and devoid of any sort of viable plot.<br /><br />After seeing some of the initial reviews for this movie, I knew I had to check it out.  It was rated VERY highly, and I hoped that so many people couldn't be wrong about this movie.<br /><br />This movie was incredible.  The animation is top-notch (computer animation has come a long way since Tron and The Last Starfighter). The voices are definitely on the mark for the characters.  And the plot...simplistic, but it's nice to see solid growth in the main character and a good resolution, with a little ribbing on the sourpusses of the movie.<br /><br />Cars is more than just watchable...I've seen it several times, and have noticed new things going on every time.

CARS certainly has dazzling animation and its basic selfish guy gets a heart premise will probably find its way into the hearts of the families that watch it.  Is it really all that different?  Other than the fact that the characters are CARS, it's really just a rehash of films like ICE AGE, OVER THE HEDGE, ETC. ETC.  But one can't deny it's entertainment value.  Randy Newman's delightful song OUR TOWN will probably garner him another nomination, and the voicing is really fun.  Owen Wilson is speedster Lightning McQueen, the hero whose self-importance takes a bruising when he finds himself in the small almost deserted town of Radiator Springs.  There he meets a Porsche lawyer voiced by Bonnie Hunt; a towtruck named Mater which is Larry the Cable Guy; and a former racing hero named Hudson Hornet played by Paul Newman.<br /><br />There are some cute moments and the animation IS brilliant, so CARS is a fun film to enjoy.",Cars
809232,B000H7I6CU, A2ZUL7I0ATUTN,4.0, Revie,"I thoroughly enjoyed Pixar's latest movie and here's my review. (No Spoilers Included)<br /><br />The open-ended one sentence summary: Selfish racecar gets stranded in a little Route 66 town with a towtruck voiced by Larry the Cable Guy. 'Nuff said.<br /><br />Content Inappropriate for All Ages: 2 mild ""bad words"" refering to a place, and about 5 innuendos, most involving ""nuts"".<br /><br />Characters: 4 of 5 cars. Lots of variety in this department. Most of the characters were believable and acted accordingly, but I didn't care about them as much as I was expecting. First of all, Mater (voiced by Larry the Cable Guy) was a riot. Mack the truck had an awfully familiar voice... *wink* and did a good job. The only casting choice I didn't like was Bonnie Hunt as Sally. She sounded too old for the part.<br /><br />Plot: 4 of 5 cars. Starts off with a twist, falls into a pattern for a while, then ends with a twist I didn't even see coming. Comedic bits interspersed. Pretty quality stuff.<br /><br />Animation: 5 of 5 cars. Animation like we've come to expect from Pixar. I'm sure it was hard to animate those cars' faces.<br /><br />Music: 4 of 5 cars. The songs (not original) perfectly capture the essence of the movie. I didn't find the score memorable, though.<br /><br />Impact: 3 of 5 cars. I'd say this is the most important section of the review. I did get involved in this movie when I saw it, but it wasn't a tear-jerker. The big finale didn't leave me with the sense of triumph which was essentially the whole point. I did think about this movie after I saw it, but I wasn't enamoured with it. It didn't leave me with any hard hitting thoughts on its characters, or side splitting lines to quote.<br /><br />All in all, 4 of 5 cars.",Cars
809233,B000H7I6CU, AZTDHDUTVOSCC,4.0, Another Disney Pixar Classic,"I always find the Disney Pixar films to be a treat. And Cars is no different. The animation is incredible, with canyon landscapes, waterfalls, and highways. And with a great soundtrack, the music montages throughout the film are impeccable.<br /><br />The voices are great. All too often, the names of the cast of these animated movies are much bigger than the actual voice talents. But it's great to hear the voices of Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy (who is hilarious by the way) playing around on screen.<br /><br />And don't forget about the minor characters. It's great seeing stereotype cars such as the hippie van, the army jeep, the sexy Porsche, the old carriage, the German Volkswagen beetle, and many others. Though funny, it's refreshing to see that they didn't center the plot around a silly gag such as stereotyping cars, the way it was advertised.<br /><br />The plot is very simple, a big shot race car learns his lesson by making friends while stuck in a remote town in the middle of nowhere. It's simple, but affective.<br /><br />The only complaint I have with the film is its length. At 2 hours, it certainly seemed to drag. However, all in all, other than nitpicks, it was a heartwarming film.",Cars
809234,B000H7I6CU, A96K1ZGW56S2I,5.0, The Heartland of America.,"CARS is the latest hit from animation power-house Pixar.  The story begins at the annual Piston Cup.  It's the biggest racing event of the year and there are three favorites to win:  conceited Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), The King and reigning champion Strip Weathers (Richard Petty), and young maverick Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson).  McQueen seems to be a sure bet to win, but at the finish line the race ends in a three-way tie.  The officials decide that a run-off race between the three cars will be held in L.A.<br /><br />On the road trip across the country to L.A., Lightning finds himself stranded in the dessert.  After a late night chase with a cop, McQueen finds himself in the jail of small town Radiator Springs.  The judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences McQueen to refinish the road he destroyed.  Time is running out until the big race off in L.A., but his community service allows McQueen to finally know and understand that the most important things in life don't necessarily involve living in the fast lane.<br /><br />CARS was faulted by many critics at the time of its initial release as being a good movie with some impressive voice talent, but, nevertheless, the worst of Pixar's films.  There's a reason for this.  CARS is all about small towns, NASCAR, and Route 66.  Most critics live either on the West Coat, the East Coast, or in Chicago.  The movie greatly appeals to middle America, the heartland of the country.  For someone used to a metropolitan lifestyle, CARS must be difficult to understand.  However, for anyone who lives in middle American or who has an interest in NASCAR or Route 66, CARS is a film that you will probably adore.  I know I do.",Cars

It really depends on your child's interests. My son was three when this movie first came out.  He had never watched a movie all the way through before, and is usually bored by videos/movies.  This is the first movie that he has shown any interest in seeing.  Long before it came out he was fascinated by the pictures of cars with faces and we took him to see the movie months ago (his first movie theatre experience) and there has not been a day since that he doesn't talk about Cars.  He knows all the characters, remembers the whole plot (we only saw it once), and now he compares the types of cars in the movie with the ones he sees on the road.  I thought I wouldn't like the movie because I am totally uninterested in cars, but I thought it was really well done.  The characterizations are fun and the animation is superb.  Only Pixar could come up with such a creative, engaging movie about cars.

Disneys first try, Chicken little fell short, just not a good complex story, not saying it isn't fun, just not good enough.<br /><br />And finally, why do they continue to release movies in FOOL-SCREEN (fullscreen). It destroys the movie and what the director wanted you to see.<br /><br />Do people actually realize they cut off the side of the movie to make it fit your square tv.

The kids can see all of the cool race cars, while the adults can appreciate the story about individuals who care about each other.<br /><br />This movie has definitely been one of the better movies of the summer.  We need more movies to remind us that life is too short to not stop and smell the roses.  We need to appreciate those around us and what they bring to our lives.  Towards the end of the movie, when Lightning McQueen stops right before the finish line and goes to push ""The King"" over the finish line, the viewer can see McQueen's transformation from a selfish race car to one who realizes that he needs others on his team in order to succeed.<br /><br />I wish that there were more movies out there with such a positive message and lots of humor.  It is ironic that a movie about cars can remind me of why we need other people in our lives.<br /><br />Pixar does it again.  Cars hits a homerun, scores a touchdown, and wins first prize in the race.  We all need to remember to stop and smell the roses.  Seeing Cars reminded me of that very fact.",Cars

For instance, Mr. The King is a reference to Richard Petty, and Pixar does just about everything but come out and call him Mr. Petty.  Owen Wilson does a fantastic job as Lightning McQueen because even though he's a famous actor, his lines aren't tired and bored.  It's almost like he enjoyed the filming.<br /><br />Could they have picked a better person for the redneck tow truck than Larry the Cableguy?  I don't believe so.  My favorite scene in the whole movie is the tractor tipping, which I can see Larry doing.  Same with George Carlin as the hippy van (it's probably the only role I've ever liked him in).<br /><br />Not only is the cast great, but the story is fantastic.  Lightning McQueen is that spoiled superstar, who happens to find himself in the middle of nowhere.

It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.",Cars

809267,B000H7I6CU, A11C43I615R52G,5.0, Cars is worth the ride and even better in HD!!!,"When it premiered in 2006, Cars was met with some lukewarm response from critics. It was positive but not as positive as previous Pixar films have been met. Still, Cars is a really good movie with great animation, voice cast, characters and a good story. I've never been interested in the world of racing but when I saw Cars in theaters, I realize it was not only for racing fans. It has a wide appeal and I really enjoyed it. Lightning McQueen is a very well-rounded character and you can see his transformation from selfish moron to a caring and loyal friend. The story has really good messages and as with every Pixar film, the animation and the level of detail is simply breathtaking.<br /><br />Cars may not be your cup of tea but is a worthwile picture and I think it deserved the Best Animated Feature Oscar instead of Happy Feet which may be good but not as good at this one. Cars may be seen like the worst Pixar production but even worst Pixar means amazing and much much better than all the competition has to offer. Cars is an excellent film.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />Cars arrived on Blu-ray on 2007 in a single-disc package. Now Disney has repackaged it alongside a DVD in order to promote the sequel that will premiere this summer in theaters. Cars BD is magnificent. You can watch every detail, every nuance, every texture in the screen. No compression artifacts are found in the print. Cars BD is amazing.<br /><br />Likewise, the 5.1 uncompressed Audio is the equivalent of the picture in the sound department. You can hear everything with absolute clarity.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />In comparison with other Pixar BD sets, Cars is somewhat light in the bonus features department but still has a lot of insight bonus material.<br /><br />First you have the Cine-explore feature which allows you to see the picture in an interactive way where you can choose between two audiocomentaries (one with John Lasseter and the other with the animators), also this feature enables you to pick some featurettes that will appear from time to time. This mini documentaries include design of characters, settings, graphics, animation and more.  If you prefer you can also watch this documentaries separately. You also have deleted scenes, a game, the shorts One Man's Band and Mater and the Ghostlight, the inspiration for the movie and more.<br /><br />A DVD copy is also offered.<br /><br />Sneak Peeks:<br />Some trailers include:<br /><br />Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)<br />The Lion King: Diamond Edition (on BD and DVD this fall)<br />The Incredibles on BD (already released)<br />Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (on BD and DVD Sep. 20)<br />The Fox and the Hound: 30th Anniversary (on BD and DVD Aug. 9)<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br /><br />Cars is an excellent film that is worth watching. With stunning video and excellent audio and many insightful bonus material this BD/DVD combo is a must-own release. Completely recommended!!!",Cars

No complaints coming from the little guy, but there's something about the metallic paint of these vehicles that don't seem to have the same quality as the typical ""Cars"" cars you find in stores.  Not sure if it was due to a limited production run, or simply due to contaminates in the air/paint.  Not an issue for young kids, but may be a concern for some collectors.

Our picks in movies have to be attitude-minimum, since my little one picks up on it and imitates.  The 'tude in ""Cars"" characters is shown to be unacceptable behavior to other characters.  The soundtrack is well-done, featuring a nice array of old, and remade and new songs.  It's also free of sing-song tunes, which grate the nerves if you happen to want to watch movies with your children or just be in the same house while they watch!

On his way to winning it all, he ignores the advice of his pit crew and blows his tires near the finish line. A photo-finish shows a 3-way tie and sets the stage for the big race. A wrong turn on his way to California lands him in hot water at Radiator Springs. Sentenced to fix the road he destroyed in this old and dilapidated town something happens. The self-centered racing stud starts to care about something more than himself.<br /><br />This a great movie for kids and adults. The story is wonderful as are the lessons to be learned. I am extremely partial to this film because it was my little boy's 1st favorite movie! Disney/Pixar do it again!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: DAZZLING!

809308,B000H7I6CU, A2VN15501IUTND,5.0, Inspirational,"Cars is another winner from the combined efforts of Disney and Pixar. Anyone who watches this movie will be able to relate to a character, from the spiteful Hudson Hornet/Doc Hudson to the easygoing Mater. A star studded cast of voice actors gives this film recognizable voices for anyone. Some of the actors are: Paul Newman (one of my favorites in this film), Owen Wilson (Marley and Me, Drillbit Taylor, Night at The Museum), Larry the Cable Guy, (another one of my favorites) and John Ratzenberger, who has appeared in all the Pixar film and plays his most prominent role in this one. The general gist of the movie is a stuck-up rookie racecar, namely Lightning McQueen, getting arrested in a small Route 66 town called Radiator Springs, where life is mostly about trying to passing through tourist to buy something from one of the characters stores. Over the course of the movie, you find that the town doctor was the best racecar around in his younger days, but had a big crash that ended his career. He know does not want anything to do with the racecar that comes to town. McQueen learns the importance of slowing down and enjoying the ride on the Highway of Life. He helps everyone in the town, and even restores the 60's neon lights in the town. Also, he falls in love with the town attorney, a 911 Porsche. But the best part is the end, when McQueen has a chance to win the Piston Cup, but instead helps one of the greats (called ""The King"" in the movie and modeled after Richard Petty's Plymouth Firebird and voiced by Petty himself) finish his final race. This movie has the best moral of any of the Pixar movies. An added bonus is all the retro cars, from a Model T to a 50's Chevy Impala. Plus there are some great punch lines as with all the Pixar movies. I've saved the best part of this movie for last. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring Rascall Flatts, Sheryl Crow, and Brad Paisley, I would rate it as one notch below the soundtrack of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOGI"">Rocky IV</a>, which has the best soundtrack of all time. Overall this is a phenomenal film. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!!!",Cars

The only thing is that I would like it to have Spanish track (Disney does this very often), however that is my mistake because I did not read carefully the specs. Other than that, Cars is just lovely for children.",Cars
809310,B000H7I6CU, A10CJINP7KBR4W,4.0, Last of the Conventional Pixar,"Pixar has always been a great movies.  Cars is no exception.  However, in terms of movie history, Cars was the last of the traditional Pixar.  Since then the stories have been more unconventional, following a rat who wants to cook, a robot love story, and a man who moves his house with balloons.  So, its fun to watch Cars, which follows the more traditional story of a hot shot car who learns the value of a little town life.  The characters are great, mader especially is funny, and the movie makes clever use of the car world.  Everything is car related, from cattle to the bugs (watch closely and you'll see).  Also, I appreciate the basis of the story, the lost world of Route 66, where people cared about there stop, rather than drove past only stopping for gas.  In short, the movie is a resounding success that should be seen. Also, the blu-ray is gorgeous.  It is demo quality, seeing the reflections off every car, every detail in the ground, and you really feel the speed during the races.  Overall, Cars is a great movie, that looks amazing.

809319,B000H7I6CU, A18OUQEK7IZ2F2,3.0, Is it suicide to critique a popular animated movie?,"Before the firing squad takes their position, at least let me tell you what I liked about it, too. I loved the Route 66 scenes and the history lesson this film teaches about the dangerous by-products of consumerism and convenience. So we get somewhere ten minutes faster, big deal. But what do we lose in the process? The Interstate System opened up America, but in the process it closed the door to much Americana.<br /><br />As for Cars, it kick-started a renaissance in Route 66 ""Mother Road"" scholarship, or at the very least an interest in driving to see what's left. Speaking for myself, I have made a point to check out US 40 in Amarillo (72-ounce steak at the Big Texan, anyone?), and have high hopes of getting to Oklahoma and Arizona in the near future. Indeed, John Lasseter's inspiration for the film was his own family's cross-country road trip in 2000.<br /><br />Being equally honest, I didn't care for the racing scenes, even though they were visually impressive. Every Disney film has its villain, but Chuck Hicks was unnecessarily mean with no redeeming qualities. At least Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), despite starting his relationship with Lightning in an adversarial manner, ultimately transforms into a father-son mentor.<br /><br />There's also lots of crashing and aggression on the track, which certainly contributes to the rookie's unhealthy win-at-any-cost mentality, at least until he is forced to spend some down time in Radiator Springs, a la Doc Hollywood. (Did the writers of that film receive any credit for the blatant lift?)<br /><br />And while I like Mater's heart, I am unhappy that he has been fashioned into such a White Trash caricature. He's dumb and dirty and he talks funny. In my opinion, it's not enough to portray him as the tow truck equivalent of the ""whore with a heart of gold."" Overall, I was disappointed at the many simple stereotypes. Even Guido, though cute, is painted as a non-English speaking immigrant, fit only to change tires.<br /><br />This film has its moments. I just don't think the people who embrace the Route 66 legacy are also going to cheer the NASCAR racing, and vice versa. Great music, though.<br /><br />See also:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312281617"">Route 66: The Mother Road 75th Anniversary Edition</a><br />(by Sheriff!)",Cars

809323,B000H7I6CU, A22RY8N8CNDF3A,4.0, Get Your Kicks Watching Cars on Route 66!,"Owen Wilson's friendly voice as race car ""Lightning McQueen"" is perfect for the Pixar movie about all kinds of cars.  The animation is outstanding as usual.  The mega-truckstop at the beginning of the movie showed a perfect example of the fantastic art and culture of the road.  ""Cars"" frames the 'road of life' and lessons old and young souls understand.  Kids will especially enjoy the racing and action scenes.<br /><br />Lightning is in a hurry to get to California for a big race and is traveling cross-country in a semi-truck. A series of accidents happen and Lightning McQueen ends up in a small desert town of Radiator Springs.  It is full of dying businesses because the traffic they depend on has been diverted to a new, faster Interstate.  When the old Route 66 went through, Desert Springs was doing well.  Lightning is arrested for tearing up the road and put in a ""boot"" and impounded.  The rusty old Tow Truck (Mato - short for To-Mato) is voiced over by Larry the Cable Guy.  Mato is friendly, dopey and kind to Lightning.  Lightning only wants to get back to his fast-paced world.<br /><br />The story is somewhat nostalgic for times that were not as pressured.  The reference to Route 66 following the bends and the lay of the land reminds us we need to take time to stop and smell the roses.  Now we have interstates cutting through in straight lines to save a few minutes here and there.  The story flows well and moves fast.  It is a thoughtful, creative movie and highly amusing.<br /><br />All the car characters are well developed and personalities match their make and models.  We have diversity and idiosyncrasy in the mix. There is the romance of the road as well as Lightning McQueen's romance with a sweet and racy Porsche lawyer (Bonnie Hunt).",Cars

They usually avoided all the off-topic jokes and pop culture references that you'll typically see in most animated family movies.  Cars crossed that line a bit, but the story telling is still there.  It seems unique and typical at the same time, which makes no sense, but that is how it feels.  I can't say more than that without spoiling the movie.<br /><br />Visuals (5/5):<br />While watching the film, I kept saying in my head, ""Man, that must've been expensive to make.""  It looks amazing and detailed, and they didn't blur out distance details to say time and money.  Moreover, without the human features, the cars would be hard to distinguish from the real thing.  So this is a must buy for Blu-ray people.  One should also consider upgrading their entertainment center for Pixar movies in general, or you'll be missing out.<br /><br />Characters and Voicing (5/5):<br />Another great thing about Pixar films is that they cast people that fit the roles they're voicing.  No random popular celebrity for marketing purposes.  Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy (to name a few) all did great jobs voicing his/her character.  The characters (with car type matching their personality) are very interesting across the board.",Cars

Look, I must confess, I cant stand Owen Wilson, his naisal voice and that bizarre nose, I mean what actress could have a career like he has had if she had a nose like that, I mean, right..but since I didnt not have to look at him, I actually liked his take on the main character, and Larry the Cable Guy is perfect as the old Redneck tow truck, as for the Porsche, I really didnt like Bonnie Hunt, her voice is too old, she is like well into her forties, they needed a Jennifer Anniston or Angie Jolie to voice that character, they are more Wilson's age, in all due respect, Hunt's voice was for like an 80's Accord, but whatever..cute movie, great vivid dig animation, kids will love it`",Cars

We've probably watched it every day for 3 weeks straight, and I'm actually not sick of it yet! The animation is amazing on Blue Ray; in some of the scenes, the cars actually look real. And there are so many little details that went into this movie that make it really special, like how the engine noises of the different types of cars are accurate (like the purr of the Porsche).<br />My favorite scenes are Guido's 3 second pit stop, and the tractor tipping scene (I crack up every time Mater says, ""That's Frank!"")<br /><br />This is a fun movie to watch, even if you're not a racing fan.

809341,B000H7I6CU, A5QCKO0LL1D5E,5.0, Cars on Blu-Ray,"This is a must have for your collection. I don't even like this movie that much. I think it's one of Pixar's weaker films. Of course Pixar is always good quality entertainment, so even a weaker film by their standards is better than all that unwatchable CGI nonsense from other companies. We can talk about the cliched storyline of the arrogant city slicker driving into an old, beat up town populated with goofy characters all day. It wouldn't matter. The movie is a total cliche, he learns his lessons about life and not being selfish, he wins the affection of the ""girl car"", he inspires the old champion racer to reconnect with the world again, his goofy sidekicks rebuild their town and get back to grooving, whatever... It's not a great story.<br /><br />The story and characters are second rate but the visual quality of this movie on Blu-Ray will make your jaw drop! I watched Ratatouille on Blu-Ray first and was mightily impressed but I knew Cars would take the cake as a demonstration disc on account of Cars being very colorful. It exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Watch the scene when the main character ""Lighting McQueen"" gets into that transport truck and they drive out of the stadium and across the freeway of the city at night and then across the highways of the Southwest in the day. ""Life is a Highway"" is the musical cue during this scene. The visual scheme is gorgeous, lifelike, 3-Dimensional with an extreme sense of depth perception. It looks like real life even though it's a CGI animated film!<br /><br />I watched Cars using a PS3 connected via a standard HDMI cable to a 42 inch, 1080p LCD TV by LG. Every person who has seen this kind of quality has been very delighted as the reviews here demonstrate and so will you!<br />WALL-E is going to look drop dead gorgeous when it comes out. I saw WALL-E at the movie theater, on a massive screen with digital projection. It looked great. It will be eye poppingly awesome on Blu-Ray too. Until then, you've got Cars and Ratatouille.

Ben plopped down right next to me, seeing the disc case, asking, ""Are you going to watch ""Cars""? Can I watch it with you?""<br /><br />The movie loaded and unspooled, and you would have thought he had never seen it before.<br />Was it the three-dimensional, hypnotizing, hyper-real images?

He got back into the movie as if it was a totally new experience.<br /><br />Now as a father who probably could lip-synch the movie if pressed, I have to tell you the same exact thing happened to me.

I have yet to let him watch Nemo. Also, I am doing everything I can to discourage NASCAR viewer ship in my household.

My son loves the cars and although he had not asked for the movie, my partner and I needed a break from Thomas, so I bought the widescreen version of this movie.<br /><br />The first thing I realized was that this is the same story as Doc Hollywood. Now, I happen to be a sap and I loved Doc Hollywood, but I was afraid it might be a too-familiar theme to keep my interest. Suffice it to say, I did not pause the movie one time from start to end.<br /><br />Some say it does not have enough drama, but I am so glad no one has to die in this one, especially the Mom - and in a very loud and violent way - such as with Nemo. (I am still wondering whether Walt Disney ever got therapy for his Mother issues. Between the Mothers dying and the rest of the older women being witches - well...)<br /><br />The characters are amazingly well-developed, remarkably loveable and incredibly designed.

809402,B000H7I6CU, A1COW0UIB5HA9J,4.0, Very good but not up to Pixar's other greats!,"In a world where cars rule, celebrity race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) had a swanky lifestyle of fortune and glory until one uneven night when he's on his way to the major race coming soon in California, Lightning gets left behind accidently. He's left stranded in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs on Route 66 where he accidently damages the town's road as he's forced by the locals to fix it, during his stay he befriend Sally (Bonnie Hunt), former race car champion Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), redneck truck Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), and  Ramone (Cheech Marin) as he really wants to get to the race until he realizes that he has to help the poor unfortunite town back to it's original glory.<br /><br />Very entertaining and sometimes funny yet witty Pixar Cgi animated comedy is well done but no where on the quality as Pixar's other movies like ""Toy Story 1 & 2"", ""Monsters Inc."", ""Incredibles"", ""Finding Nemo"" and the highly underrated ""A Bug's Life"". Sure it's got a great cast especially Michael Keaton as Lightning's rival Chick Hick with George Carlin and splendid CGI animation, but it's not quite original like the other works of Pixar cause this movie will remind viewers of the Michael J. Fox movie ""Doc Hollywood"" with it's similar plot. But luckily this year's ""Rataoullie"" was a vast improvement on this movie, but i believe ""Happy Feet"" with the highly underrated ""Monster House"" did much better then this movie back in 2006 when it comes to unique CGI animated movies.<br /><br />This DVD contains a load of cool extras like two short films, a featurette on how they made the movie and deleted scenes, it is very good but thankfully ""Ratatoulie"" was better.",Cars

809444,B000H7I6CU, A3B1QVMBW7YVOQ,5.0, A Fun Family Film--From the Small Town to the Big Track!,"I took my kid (age 6) to see ""Cars"" last week, not really knowing what to expect.  I've never been into racing, but was attracted by the concept (anyone else remember the shortlived cartoon ""Wheelie""?).  Both of us were able to connect with the humor right away, which like the diverse characters in this film spans several generations.  The concept of a world populated entirely by inanimate vehicles (mostly cars, but a tractor or train here and there) is a relatively original one on the big screen, and the studio must have had a lot of fun with this one.<br /><br />Character development was terrific--just as each make and model of vehicle has its own technical characteristics in real life, each personality in ""Cars"" has its own talents and quirks.  The plot revolves around rookie racer Lightning McQueen, who is part of a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup, and must cross the country to Los Angeles where there will be a tie-breaker between himself, dependable veteran The King, and perpetual second-placer Chick Hicks.<br /><br />Along the road to Los Angeles, Lightning McQueen's selfishness is the cause of an unintended detour to a little town called Radiator Springs.  Radiatior Springs is a nifty village on route 66 complete with chrome and neon styling that the new interstate left off the map years ago.  Characters include the older and wiser Doc Hudson (Hornet), who has a secret past and manages to mentor Lighting McQueen and teach him a thing or two.  Sally is a Porsche who left fast-paced Los Angeles to settle down in Radiator Springs and open a Motel. 'Mater is the town's friendly (if rusty) towtruck with a true sense of country humor.  Flo runs the service station, Ramon the Paint and Detail shop (always with a new coat!), Luigi the tire store...There really is something for everyone, including a running humorous dialogue between ""Sarge"", an Army-regulation olive drab AMC Jeep who runs the local military surplus shop, and Fillmore, a '60's VW Bus with a psychadelic paint job.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away too much detail, I don't want to spoil the experience for fellow viewers.  My kid loved this film and understood the humor.  There were a lot of laugh out loud moments for the both of us.  As a parent, I liked the lessons ""Cars"" taught about ethics, hard work, respect, kindness, keeping your word, and the importance of friendship.  Not to mention appreciating things that aren't necessarily brand new or in the fast lane!  A cute movie, fun for the whole family, a reminder that the best things in life are sometimes hidden off the main thoroughfare.  Oh, and hang around past the credits--you WILL be rewarded with the punch line for an earlier gag!",Cars
809445,B000H7I6CU, A2N9RL87HUICW0,5.0, Pixar raised the bar once again. Go see Cars!,"The Bottom Line: Go see CARS!!! Pixar gathered all of the best parts of any its films and jammed them into one great film with the best animation, memorable characters, non-stop action, and heart that defines Pixar films. Go see CARS!!!<br /><br />I will admit it. I think I am THE world's greatest Pixar fan. I grew up with Pixar. Pixar fostered my early childhood all the way to my teenage years. I know everything about Pixar. Some would even call me obsessed. From each short, to the inside jokes, and to all of the great characters; I've memorized all the best one liners to all of Pixar's films. I've watched each one of the films a million times. I am the best!<br /><br />Which is exactly what Lightning McQueen, the racecar who thinks he's all that, thinks. After he races in the huge Piston Cup race, but ends up in a three-way tie, Lightning McQueen believes that he will win that Piston Cup. But like all great films, he confronts a problem, getting lost in the town of Radiator Springs and slowly realizing that the Piston Cup is only ""an empty cup.""<br /><br />It is at Radiator Springs where Lightning learns the importance that it's not about the prize at the end, but the journey that one takes to get to the prize. Cars is a movie about how Route 66 was almost forgotten by the construction of the interstate. It's about knowing that judging others is not the best thing. It's about how people can get away from the rush of city life and enjoy the small town life. Best of all, it is a movie that everybody can enjoy.<br /><br />The audience cried, they cheered, and they laughed for the characters on screen, because they cared for these characters. At two hours long, Cars is the longest Pixar film so far, but that's too short. Because Cars spends about a quarter of the movie developing the characters, some may say that the film almost stops and doesn't get anywhere, until it speeds up again. Lightning must fix the road that he broke. Along the way, he goes tractor tipping with Mater the tow truck, cruising with Sally the porshe, and competing with Doc Hudson the Hudson Hornet. During the ""Our Town"" sequence, I could feel a tear down my cheek and the Pixar folks tugged at my heartstrings. The finale sequence is probably the best finale sequence that Pixar has ever made. Each character introduced has a purpose in the film, and doesn't exist just as an ensemble.<br /><br />On top of the excellent story, Cars has the best animation, traditional or computer generated, that Pixar films are known for. The vistas look surprisingly real and detailed, especially on the big screen. The reflections, the lighting, and the shading in the characters make the characters realistically stand out from the background. The filmmakers did an excellent job visually making the viewers believe that these cars are living and breathing, having human-like qualities. Each shot of the film is a piece of art, with so much happening on the screen at one point at a time that one only wonders how Pixar did it.<br /><br />Since Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, Pixar put one instant classic after another, creating and living up to the standard for the future of classic films. And guess what? Pixar has done it again. As a piece of fast-speed and high-quality entertainment, Pixar's Cars is the best fun you'll have all year. You're in for one hell of a ride.<br /><br />(Here's a little secret for you: Look out for all of the Pixar inside jokes scattered throughout the movie. There's the jackalope from ""Boundin'"" on a trailer, the birds from ""For The Birds"" on a telephone pole, the Pizza Planet Truck behind the announcers, and if you stay to the very, very end of the credits, you'll get a surprise from the Pixar folks.)",Cars
809446,B000H7I6CU, A2F9ERD4UMAQY5,5.0," Don't Fall for the Negative Reviews, It Was Great!","This was a great movie.  The animation was top notch, both adults and children can be entertained by this film, and despite what some neysayers will tell you....there IS a story line.  Apparently the people that feel there is no story line couldn't grasp the simple message of ""take life slow and enjoy"".  The town of Radiator Springs used to be a hustle and bustle town.  But then a major freeway was opened up, which bypassed the town, saving commuters a mere 10 minutes.  We learned our lesson on our last road trip, we got off the main highway and took some alternate route, which lead us through small towns that we never saw from the main road.<br /><br />And as for the length and whatnot, MY 2 YEAR OLD SAT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING!  He just sat there and watched the screen through the entire 90 some minute flick.  If an 8 year old can't sit through this, then maybe their parents should limit their sugar intake and video games in hopes to regain their attention span.<br /><br />Overall, this is a GREAT movie.  Well put together, great messages behind it, lessons to be learned, and it is entertaining.  So don't listen to the negative comments because chances are, the neysayers have the attention span of a goldfish and couldn't understand the simple messages in the lessons Lightning McQueen learned: take life slow and enjoy, and that sometimes you need to think about others rather than yourself.",Cars

He not only made it completey through Cars, which is longer than most animation movies, but sat through the touching and funny credits at the end.

809500,B000H7I6CU, ATDE9JYCPI0L1,5.0, Crowd pleaser,"All right. I wanted to see the characterizations by Car Talk stars, Tom and Ray, a.k.a. Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers. The Car Talk comedians make a brief, not-so-funny appearance in the first scenes. Still, I, my 14-year-old son and his aunt came away happy, despite the predictable and corny story line.<br /><br />At the grand opening event, rookie racer Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) vies for the coveted Piston Cup against incumbent champion, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), who is determined to best his perennial second-place, at all costs. The rookie, naturally full of himself, expects to step from peddling Rusteze into big league Dynaco sponsorship. But the three tie for first place, and a tie-breaker is scheduled in California. Lightning immediately sets off, aboard his faithful truck, Mack (John Ratzenberger). En route, Mack's back panel accidentally opens and the sleeping Lightning falls out on the dark interstate, where he is awakened by the roar of oncoming traffic.<br /><br />Frantic to find Mack, Lightning chases the wrong truck off the interstate and winds up on Route 66 in Radiator Springs. That's where the fun starts. Race cars have no lights, and Lightning drives blindly, tearing up the road as he goes.<br /><br />In court, mechanic, judge and 1951 Hudson Hornet Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) are inclined (the last, for secret reasons) to let Lightning go, but local attorney Sally (Bonnie Hunt) pressures the judge to make him repair the road he has destroyed. During his days at work, Lightning is befriended by Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and eventually by all the other town characters as well, including Sally, Sheriff (Michael Wallis), tire store owner Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) and his sidekick Guido (Guido Quaroni), a retired army jeep named Sarge (Paul Dooley), a shabby VW bus, Fillmore (George Carlin)--and even the Doc, whose historical racing championships Lightning discovers and advertises.<br /><br />There are plenty of twists and turns in this albeit predictable road, but the end result is an instant classic, filled with great Randy Newman music, terrific scenery and some wonderful lessons about friends, community and the importance of keeping things in perspective.<br /><br />We loved it, cliches and all.<br /><br />--Alyssa A. Lappen",Cars
809501,B000H7I6CU, A26WVK274IA7DN,2.0, In need of some repair,"Pixar usually makes children's films that also appeal to adults on many levels, including jokes that fly well above the heads of youngsters. My son, who is three, loves to watch the first ten minutes of ""Cars."" Then he gets extremely bored and stops watching. Good films, such as ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" and ""Toy Story,"" will hold his attention for the duration. (He knows ""Finding Nemo"" from start to finish and has watched it, at minimum, fifty times.)  I also enjoy good children's movies (I know most of the lines from ""Finding Nemo""), yet I find this film tedious. At a runtime of nearly two hours, I cannot sit through the entire movie in one sitting and even then have a difficult time watching all of it. It starts out well enough and the ending, with its positive messages of friendship, loyalty and good sportsmanship, is quite good. Much of the material in between, however, is fairly weak. Scenes drag on far too long and are just plain dull. The messages could have been conveyed in fewer and more truncated scenes and still have been as effective. The basis for a very good film here is certainly evident. As usual, Pixar's animation is excellent and the tone is just right for kids: simple without being condescending and with very sparse scatological humor (which is an astonishing feat, given Larry the Cable Guy's involvement). The voice acting is well cast and features uniformly fine performances. With more judicious writing and editing, ""Cars"" could have been another Pixar classic. (2.5/5 stars)",Cars

809506,B000H7I6CU, A1DG29RP3FBQ74,5.0, Good stuff!,"I look forward to the new Pixar movie every year, and there is good reason for that. They keep pumping out clean entertainment, and ""Cars"" is no different.<br /><br />I found ""Cars"" to be quite different in its approach, as it kind of spoofs Nascar but glorifies it at the same time. I am not a Nascar fan, but I found this to be a truly funny movie. Because of the theme, you can enjoy this as a Nascar fan who has never seen Pixar before OR as a Pixar fan who has never followed Nascar. If you happen to like both--this movie is a bonus for you!<br /><br />The movie pulls all the right strings by being genuinely funny, teaching moral lessons, being romantic, and being melodramatic all at the same time. From that perspective, this may seem like so much cheese to some, and you can be warned. However, this is just part of the Pixar formula, and it seems to work every time.<br /><br />The artwork is grand, and the acting... errr... voices are good too. There are a large number of ""cameo"" appearances as well, and that just adds to the fun. Nothing like trying to play ""spot the star"" with a cartoon full of cars!!<br /><br />All I can say is, if you've enjoyed the previous Pixar films you will enjoy this, and if you've never seen another Pixar movie--now's a good time to start!",Cars
809507,B000H7I6CU, A2ZHH7AK83JB5G,4.0, Good but not great compared to the Pixar classics.,"I liked CARS I really did like it but it lacks the magic of TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  It is beautiful to look at since the animation is so imaginatively detailed.  I can see it would be a dream come true to a Preschooler obsessed with anything that sprouts wheels.  The Route 66 references were great and I hope this movie will help keep the ""mother road"" in the minds of  younger generations.  Having lived in Oklahoma I had to smile about  cow er I mean tractor tipping being so enthustiastically embraced by the small town residents.  The characterizations of vehicles living in ""Radiator Springs"" were clever but came from central casting.  The most original element of ""Cars"" is it's depiction of a wheels only universe with nary a human about.

Lightning Mcqueen is a hot shot rookie racer who gets stranded in a small town after getting scared and tearing up main street after a string of missunderstandings.  After being forced to stay and fix his damange, he grows to like the quaint settings, and it's inhabitents, including the Tow Mater, played by Larry the Cable Guy.

809524,B000H7I6CU, AWNKEM8DAG8PY,4.0, Cars (3.5 stars),"The seventh film from the incredible collaboration between Disney and Pixar, Cars is probably the most mixed and formulaic movie of the bunch. That's not to say the movie isn't good. The premise, a world populated with anthropomorphic cars &agrave; la every single Disney movie ever, is admittedly prosaic but Lasseter and co. know how to milk that formula like nobody else. Cars serves as further proof of this as the film has got it where it really counts. Though the characters and the coming-of-age tale are about as traditional as it gets, Pixar again picks the perfect talents to breathe life into their CG creations. Everyone is appropriately charismatic, tough, melancholy, or goofy with Owen Wilson and Larry The Cable Guy leading the way. Visually, Cars is absolutely stunning, topping all of Pixar's previous efforts. Sometimes the gorgeous vistas are almost too good; one can easily find themself admiring the scenery instead of paying attention to the story but the quick pace manages to reel the film's audience back in quickly enough. The only quality of Cars that is worthy of being deemed ""bad"" is the soundtrack; no matter how hand-in-hand country and Nascar go, bad music is still bad music (which would have been easily fixed if only Randy Newman sang the tunes). While not as revolutionary as Toy Story, heart-warming as Finding Nemo, or brilliant as The Incredibles, Cars manages to generate enough smiles and heart-felt moments to allow it a place on the shelf next to the rest of the Disney/Pixar gems.",Cars

809526,B000H7I6CU, AG42CYU5P8NVQ,5.0, Finally got around to seeing it.,"I admit that I avoided it in the theatre.  Partially because I was annoyed that Pixar was bought out by Disney and the fact my girl is noise sensitive and would have gotten upset over the race scenes and the noise involved.<br /><br />While getting a haircut for her, they had it playing.  I decided to buy it after she was done.<br /><br />As typical to Pixar it's a great story about about a self absorbed up and coming race car named Lightning McQueen (named after Steve McQueen).<br /><br />Lightning thinks he can do everything by himself and it comes back on him as he ignores advice and ends up in a 3-way tie in a race he should have won.  He has to head out to California for a race off between the 3 winners and eventually gets lost and ends up on the forgotten roads of Route 66.  He panics and ends up destroying the streets of the forgotten town of Radiator Springs.  He is caught and his punishment is to repair the roads.<br /><br />There he finds many characters.  Doc Hudson (Paul Neuman) who may have a secret past, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) the simple happy go lucky tow truck, and of course a nice Girl Porsche Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) who is a dreamer and longs for what the town used to be.<br /><br />Along the way Lightning makes friends with the town people.  Mater being the best friend.  He helps the improve itself and they help him start thinking about other people.<br /><br />The movie has a well rounded cast with the efforts of Tony Shalhoub, Cheeh marin, John Ratzenburger, Michel Keaton, George Carlin, and cameos by others.<br /><br />There are two shorts, One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight.  I lost count on how many times my girl had to watch them!<br /><br />There are deleted scenes which are drawing form.<br /><br />There is a short by John Lasseter called Inspiration For Cars.  He takes you on a trip on Route 66 and you can see where stuff came from in the movie!  You even get to meet the real life Mater!<br /><br />I am happy with this purchase and I HOPE Disney leaves them alone!",Cars

The whole family commented on the difference.  The complete picture was just sharper with much more detail visible.  For example, in the racing scenes you could actually make out the cars in the seats in the speedway!  The desert landscape detail was just fantastic all the way out to the horizon.  I was sceptical.  I had resisted buying any animation on Blu-ray, but I thought I would give one a try.  As far as Cars is concerned, anyway, I was pleasantly surprised.

809538,B000H7I6CU, A3CP1WGNTOSKDA,5.0," Terrific on All Levels, Including Blu-ray Transfer","This is one of those Pixar flicks that does a better job of character development than 90 percent of the real-people films being released today.  Bugs' Life comes to mind as another positive example. It's a Disney production that even an adult can watch over and over.  I've gotten into it enough that I'm urging my family to consider a vacation out west driving Route 66.<br /><br />They said that when talkies replaced silent films, several years went by before they recovered from showcasing non-stop voice chatter and got back to real artistry in film making.  It's ironic that in this day when production houses (and audiences) can't seem to get past the gee-whiz of special effects, we need a pure animated piece to take us back to the real human-quality magic that movies can deliver.<br /><br />And then there's the Blu-ray video quality.  Holy crap!  This thing is knock-your-socks-off.  Animated films have an advantage in that everything can be simultaneously in focus.  Shadowy details can have a little contrast and sharpness added, and so-on.  The sound effects can be optimally synthesized for 5 channels.  There are simply fewer compromises.  The result is that in 1080p on an 11.5 foot screen, this is as good as I've seen, period.<br /><br />A movie about talking cars sounds dopey.  You may fear schmaltzy sentiment.  Expect to have exactly the opposite reaction.  Get it and get it now!<br />Tim Naff",Cars

809541,B000H7I6CU, A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,4.0, Pixar's Latest Crowd Pleaser,"The guys over at Pixar must be drinking some really good stuff.  It seems that no matter what ideas that they come up with, they always manage to make a great film out of them.  ""Cars"" is a prime example of that.  When I first saw the trailers for this ""vehicle,"" I have to admit that I had absolutely no interest in this film.  However, my daughter wanted to see it with one of her friends and I, along with my wife and my daughter's friend's mother and brother, headed out to see ""Cars.""  It was wonderful.  Granted, it isn't as good as some of Pixar's other efforts, but it suffices as a family comedy that everyone can watch together.<br /><br />Much like ""A Bug's Life"" and ""The Incredibles,"" ""Cars"" relies heavily on good-natured comedy to plug its message into the audience.  The story starts off with a race that's being lead by hotshot rookie, Lightning McQueen, eternal runner-up, Chick Hicks, and the elder racer on his way out, The King.  After the race ends in a three-way tie, it's decided that a race will be held in California to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.  McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is determined to get to California first and pushes his Mack truck, voiced by Pixar staple, John Ratzenberger, to drive on through the night to get there.  Of course, Mack falls asleep and McQueen is accidentally dumped in the middle of nowhere, a nice little town called Radiator Springs.<br /><br />Once there, McQueen is introduced to a kaleidoscope of funny characters voiced by the likes of another Pixar staple, Bonnie Hunt, Paul Newman, Cheech Marin, George Carlin, and Tony Shalhoub.  Larry the Cable Guy, who's the least funny of the ""Blue Collar"" guys in my opinion, makes this flick worth it for youngsters.  He supplies the bulk of the comedy for the kiddos.  Other voices that some, especially race fans, might pick out are Richard Petty (The King), Dale, Jr. as Junior, Mario Andretti as himself, and others such as Bob Costas, Katherine Helmond, and Michael Keaton.<br /><br />While in Radiator Springs, McQueen learns that it isn't always the person who comes in first or has the most bobbleheads of themselves that makes them happy.  It's just being in the place you need to be no matter what the circumstances.<br /><br />The story does run a bit long for a film focused primarily on children, and it doesn't hold up as well as the last long Pixar flick, ""The Incredibles.""  However, there's just enough laughs and in-jokes for parents and kids to make it through.  This isn't one of Pixar's best films, but it's still a fine addition to their catalogue.<br /><br />Highly recommended to families, especially if you have race fans in yours.  Pixar was perfect in capturing the thrill of a race, with great angles on all the racing action.",Cars

It did not look good, and I thought Pixar had its first flop on its hands.  Bumping the release date back six months did not ease my worry.  That being said, ""Cars"" is an excellent movie.  Pixar, I am sorry that I ever doubted you.  The voices are perfect, especially Wilson, Newman, and Larry the Cable Guy.  The film looks great, with bright colors kids will love.

But sitting there for two hours might pose a challenge for little Timmy.  ""Mommy, mommy, mommy, I need to go to the bathroom.""  There was also a moment that reminded me of Toy Story 2, that could've beem cut.  The scene when Lightning Mcqueen is being told how prosperous Radiator Springs was and how the interstate distracted the other cars away from it was kind of typical.  Remeber it was the scene with a Randy Newman written song?  Does it sound like Cowgirl Jessie's story about how Emily (I think that's the girl's name...) forgot about her and left her in a charity box.  It seemed the same.  Well, that's how I felt.

Paul Newman has resisted doing films with special effects, but this one was tailor made for him since its about cars and car racing.

Well, based on Pixar's history, I knew that it would be entertaining and I was right.<br /><br />  The movie is a fun and enjoyable film. The CGI is very well done considering that it's hard to design Cars as they have no personality or anything like that. The voices are well cast especially Paul Newman who, in real life, is really a race car driver. Typecasting? Perhaps but he's perfect for his role as a ""washed up"" race car. Of course you also have Pixar stable John Ratzenberger as a truck. Used to be John Goodman. Larry the Cable Guy is hilarious as a redneck rusted tow truck. Owen Wilson as the main character of Lightning McQueen. An egotistical selfish person but lovable nontheless.<br /><br />  The moral of the story is basically: Winning isn't everything. There are more important things then winning. And I belive, this being a family film, brings this message across throughout the movie. It's a movie that has heart, laughter, charm,and personality.

And let's face it, this film seems mostly made with little boys in mind - bright, shiny cars and trucks racing along like so many HotWheels.  The visuals were stunning, the humorous caricatures very droll and amusing.  The story is basically a hot-shot Nascar-like celebrity learning about life and humility in a small town, presumably in the California outback.  However - and this is a personal ""however"" - I must be too old for envisioning a world where the dominant (indeed, only) lifeform is the car.  Ford Prefect made that same mistake in ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".  In Disney's 1952 original car film, ""Susi the Little Coupe"" (who looked as if she would have fit into this movie just fine) there were humans around in background roles, and I think a human audience would have been less unsettling than an audience full of cars.  But maybe I am just being picky.",Cars

Over the Hedge was a good 4 star movie, while The Wild was more like 3 star, but I'm getting off track.<br /><br />Cars is the newest Pixar movie, and the only animated movies I'll be willing to see in theater is a Pixar, Aardman, OR Shrek movie.  I didn't see Cars in theatres because I heard it wasn't as good as the other Pixar movies and not as funny.  MAN I h*te critics sometimes.  This is a very good movie and should win Best Animated movie for the Oscars.  IT was better than A Bug's Life and as good as Monsters Inc.  While I think Finding Nemo and The Incredibles were better this is definately a great movie.<br /><br />The movie is all about appreciating the little things in life and slowing down.

809562,B000H7I6CU, A77184QJM3PM,5.0, Life Is A Highway,"First of all, this is a Pixar film. What this means is that this is a well-made, incredibly visualized film with a good story, strong characters, and a plot moral to make you feel things both during and after the film is done. While this film may not be quite as strong as others in the Pixar canon, it stands up quite well on its own. The basic line of the story is to take the time in life to realize what's really important in life. To not go-go-go at breakneck speed at all times, or you'll miss out on so much that life has to offer. A big parallel is drawn between the Interstate, and the more winding Route 66. We race through life on the Interstate, when we could take the scenic route on an old winding road and see and learn so much more, about ourselves and life in general. One thing I really enjoyed in this film was the strong sense of nostalgia it evoked. So many towns withered and died when their access roads suddenly were cut off by new highways. Many just didn't make it when the travelers stopped coming through, and by the magic of film, we're presented with one that almost completely dies, then comes back to life. As is usual for Pixar, the voice-over work is inspired, with many Pixar-veterans at work again here. The sound is wonderful, with the roar of a full-scale race doing laps through my surround-sound system. The picture quality is exceptional, the cars here gleam like I wish mine did! Oh well, that's the magic of movies! This fine film keeps Pixar's winning streak rolling on, what is it now, seven straight hits with no bombs anywhere? Anyway, get this film for yourself and take the time to enjoy a little side trip down Route 66.",Cars

809566,B000H7I6CU, APVKV29EDMS5H,5.0, Cars,"=+= Opening Statements =+=<br /><br />In June 2006, Pixar came out with this film that seemed to be made by the racing gods from heaven. Never had I been excited for a pixar movie in my whole life. Directed by John Lasseter and Joe Ranfit, staring Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, and many many more. Plus I got a kick out of all the celebraty voices featureing Jay Leno, Richard Petty, Darrel Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt Jr, Michael Schumacher, and Mario Andretti. Thank You for reading my opening shpeal and now...I will continue.<br /><br />=+= Plot =+=<br /><br />The story is about a fast talkin' racecar named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson). He is living life on the fast lane, he's very popular, and he is about to be the first rookie to win the Piston Cup. But, due to a three-way tie in the standings, there has to be a three-man race for the Piston Cup. On the way to the track, McQueen ends out fallign out of his trailer and left for himself on the highway. He somehow finds himself helping re-build a road he destroyed in the little town of Radiator springs. There he meets up with many new friends, like Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally (Bonnie Hunt). McQueen soon learns to take it easy, and slow it down some in this little town. The plot is very well done, and the story of how Radiator Springs came off the map was very well made.<br /><br />Plot Score: 5-5<br /><br />=+= Casting =+=<br /><br />The casting in this film was perfect. Owen Wilson leading it off with many different talents behind him, such as the legendary Paul Newman, and the very funny John Ratzenberger. Plus with all of the gguest stars, this shaped up to be perfect acting.<br /><br />Casting score: 5-5<br /><br />=+= Music =+=<br /><br />The soundtrack in this movie was excellent. Featureing the song ""Route 66"" by Chuck Berry and John Mayor. Also ""Real Gone"" by Sheryl Crow. And my personal favorite ""Life is a Highway"" by Rascal Flatts. And many many more. Excelent movie soundtrack and in a way, pretty humours for the Cow Tipping part.<br /><br />Music: 5-5<br /><br />=+= Final Thoughts =+=<br /><br />This has to be the best movie that pixar has ever came up with. The humor in this was way up there, and mix that in with great music, and a great cast and crew and what do you have? *Cars* thats what you have. Plus you have an absoulute funny afterward thing with some pixar films CARS style. This movie is perfect for the whole family, and also for all NASCAR fans, you will LOVE this one.<br /><br />Final Score: 5-5<br /><br />BTW: Just Thinkin is me...I needed a new account.",Cars
809567,B000H7I6CU, A3LPQAPU2ILDD0,4.0, Pixar. Teaching Good Values.,"Pixar and Disney are a wonderful team. After huge successes like ""Toy Story"" ""A Bug's Life"" ""Toy Story 2"" ""Monster's Inc."" and ""Finding Nemo,"" they come out with another Box Office winner in ""Cars."" But compared to their previous releases, I rank this latest offering last. It just isn't as well written a story, and I believe most will be disappointed to find very few actual racing scenes. And nowhere near as funny as their previous releases. One highlight though, is the message it brings. A reminder to all of us that, winning is not nearly as important, as how we treat others in the process of achieving our goals. Something every child in the audience needs to hear, and possibly every adult even more so.",Cars
809568,B000H7I6CU, A1WS5V4VI1L1PV,3.0," Not bad, but...","I'm as big a Pixar fan as they come. I grew up with Toy Story, and they really hit their stride with flicks like Finding Nemo and WALL-E. Cars, though? Well, to be honest, I really don't like this film that much, if any at all.<br /><br />I freely admit that this is just a personal thing, but I found no part of this movie particularly funny, interesting, or entertaining. I really like the concept and the kind of humor that could get out of it, but as far a i could see, their was no reason that the characters were cars. No attempt at any sort of car-related humor was attempted as far as I could see, and I think it was more of an excuse for Pixar to not have to animate people, because their people always look a little... well... scary.<br /><br />All this aside though, I just found Cars to be very boring. the action was standard, the characters weren't really all that interesting (certainly not as interesting or complex as Finding Nemo's cast was) and I ultimately found myself checking my watch while watching it; never a good sign. The animation was Pixar quality, so nothing bad there, there were just no surprises to this movie. The story was standard with nothing new in the mix, the dialog between the characters was wooden and unnatural, and i think i was the only one who hated Larry the Cable Guy's car Mater. I just wanted to punch him, he was so annoying.<br /><br />If you like this film, power to you. If you haven't seen this movie, trust me; go watch Finding Nemo again, or go see The Incredibles, that's an okay one too. Just don't waste your time; Cars isn't worth it.",Cars
809569,B000H7I6CU, A3UP5ZIB8MGZMS,2.0, Silly and boring,"I purchased this DVD for my husband who is a nascar fan.  When it arrived I sat down to view it with him.  I only watched it for a short time before I was completely bored.  My husband said it got better but I wasn't there to verify that, so maybe it does.",Cars
809570,B000H7I6CU, A107EAFS38OY3O,3.0, Not the best of the Pixar bunch,"Of all the movies Pixar has made this one left me the least amused once I left the theatre.  There's nothing wrong with it and it is cute (but not really funny).  The soundtrack is great for the movie but it's pretty cliche.  The soundtrack in particular does not hold a candle to the ones Randy Newman made for the Toy Story movies.  ""Life is a Highway"" rocks out and starts the movie with a serious bang, but my 6 year old thought it was too loud.  A lot of little kids were holding their ears at the start of the movie.<br /><br />The plot is entertaining but it doesn't really function on that ""next level"" that many of the Pixar movies do.  And it is impossible not to remember ""Doc Hollywood"" with Michael J. Fox and think Fox would not have been better than Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen.<br /><br />I guess I think Monsters, Inc. and the Toy Story movies were much better than this one because they created characters that expanded out of the worlds of children.  Also, Monster, Inc. and Finding Nemo both talk to the adults in the audience about parenting while entertaining the kids you went with to the movie.  It's just genius that they can pull that off.  I don't see Cars trying to pull off anything so admirable, heck, it doesn't even function on a level other than the one the kids are watching, too.  I admit there is a nostalgia thing going that kids might not quite understand but it is an upfront part of the movie plot.  The nostalgia gets a little drippy too and probably takes aim at grandparents more than 35-year-old parents because it is all about ""life before the interstate"" which was created in the late 50's early 60's...",Cars
809571,B000H7I6CU, A2K3L0DOPQQ697,5.0," so far, so good...","Disney movies really aren't my thing.  For example, I recently bought a few movies from WalMart: Serenity, Slither, and Final Destination II... none of which are Disney movies.  I used to think that Disney movies were mainly for kids. Granted, I do have the entire Lilo and Stitch series, but beyond that, my late Disney experiences have been from watching old WD movies like Beauty and the Beast and Finding Nemo with my 5-year old cousin (and don't take that as a rip on Finding Nemo; I actually really liked that movie).  What really attracted me to Cars in the first place, however, was the fact that it had Larry the Cable Guy in it, as the lovable but somewhat dimwitted Tow Mater (known throughout the film simply as Mater), seeing as I am a HUGE fan of Larry's material.  I finally got to see the movie as a result of a bootleg copy I got from a friend.  I must say, it is one of THE best Disney movies I have ever seen.  It was very family-friendly and overall quite hilarious.<br /><br />*Warning- Spoilers Ahead... Proceed With Caution*<br /><br />The premise is quite simple: a NASCAR-like superstar named Lightning McQueen is one of three cars that tied for entrance into the Piston Cup, one of the most premier races in the nation.  While on his way to the race, however, his transport truck Mac falls asleep, allowing Lightning to roll out the back of Mac's tailflap; when Lightning awakens, he chases down what he thinks is Mac, but isn't.  He finally stops in the quiet little town of Radiator Springs... but not before ripping a statue of an engine out of its base and completely tearing up the main road through the city.  The judge and town lawyer (who happens to be a very attractive female car [I feel really weird saying that]) sentence him to repave the road before he can leave for the race.  He ends up having to repave the road twice, cause the first time he didn't do it right and the road was all bumpy.<br /><br />Throughout the film, Lightning's pride almost stops him from being able to make the friendships he does while in Radiator Springs; guys like Mater (played/voiced superbly by Blue Collar Comedy Tour regular Larry the Cable Guy), a rusty old pickup truck who runs a towing company (Tow Mater... get it?  hahaha... ok.  I'll stop.) and Doc Hudson, a old (1951, I believe) Hudson Hornet who was the winner of 3 Piston Cups during his own racing days.  He eventually becomes Mater's ""new best friend"" and goes out on a tractor-tipping expedition with him... which, btw, is one of the funniest scenes in the whole movie.  The movie ends like you wouldn't expect it to (hint: Lightning doesn't win the Piston Cup), but Lightning ends up making a decision that leaves everyone watching with a nice, warm, happy feeling inside.  ^_^<br /><br />One of the nice things about Cars is that, like Finding Nemo, it is quite the unconventional movie.  The title suggests that the movie will have something to do with racing and/or cars, but the real delight is in that the main characters are the cars, not the racecar drivers; in fact, there are no drivers.  The cars in Cars are completely autonomous (they move on their own) but can talk, drive, and overall act like regular humans... remind you of the fish in Finding Nemo (which reminds me... I haven't reviewed F.N. yet... watch for my review a bit later).  It's also, as I said, very funny, yet completely ""safe for the whole family"", to borrow the slogan of a local Christian radio station.  I personally loved the movie and would highly and enthusiastically recommend this for anyone who loves movies about cars... or for that matter movies in general.<br /><br />Rated: G<br /><br />Andy ~O~",Cars

It's a bit ironic that the film's main message is to avoid being materialistic, yet Disney is probably the most commercialized company on the planet.  Never mind that though, because this truly is a great movie.<br /><br />The film has a wide range of celebrity voices.  It centers around a hot-rod race car that stumbles into a quaint suburban town on the verge of extinction.  Lightning McQueen condemns the residents and believes the town has nothing to offer him.  Of course, he learns the value of friendship, cooperation, and geniality in the end as they help him win his final big race.  The plot is predictable but it doesn't matter;  it's the journey along the way that is excellent.  The film is dripping with oddball characters.  The film has a lot of humor that is appropriate for all ages.<br /><br />It's a sensational, albeit predictable, film that inevitably charms and dazzles everyone in the audience.",Cars

809621,B000H7I6CU, A26BWRBPP4V2WF,3.0, Too many storylines gives a slow and overlong middle of the film; otherwise it's great!,"Cars suffers from that common fatal error of many films - the editor didn't (or wasn't allowed to) do his/her job.  Cars, which skirts dangerously close to the 2-hour mark, is simply too long for a kids movie.  Yes, I know the Roger Ebert maxim, ""No good film is too long, no bad film is too short"", but my young son gets bored at the 80 minute mark, especially since the hero has been stuck in first gear for the last 60 minutes.<br /><br />The story: hotshot Rookie Owen Wilson ... er, Lightning McQueen finishes his first season in the Piston Cup circuit in a 3-way points tie with veterens The King and Chick Hicks.  It is decided to have a race-off between the three cars to determine who should win the prestigious Cup.  Off the three cars head to Los Angeles, but Lightning manages to get lost and arrested in Radiator Springs - a one-stoplight town on Route 66, bypassed by the Interstate system and forgotten.  The town's grizzled doctor and circuit judge makes Lightning repair the road he tore up.  As he works in the town, Lightning learns a little about humility, a little about love, and a lot about life.<br /><br />The opening NASCAR-esque race sequence is by far the highlight of the film for me (and for my son).  The power, the speed, and the sounds of a day at the race track are lovingly reproduced, and even a non-racing fan like myself finds the sequence amazing.  Unfortunately, the middle slows down to a crawl and lasts about 30 minutes too long.  I think the problem is that the creators gave equal time to Lightning's three new relationships in the town - with Mater, the wise-cracking tow truck; with Sally, the big-city Porsche who wanted a slower life; and with Doc (voiced by the late great Paul Newman), the old-timer with a secret.  The film should have been a double-redemption story: Lightning learning what life's all about, while in parallel Doc faces his past and overcomes his bitterness.  If the filmakers had more clearly focussed on this story, and allowed the other two plotlines to recede to subplots, the film would have been focussed and more enjoyable (not to mention cheaper to make!).<br /><br />So the film only rates a 3/4 for me.  The other star is lost because this DVD edition is not up to the standards of other Pixar and John Lassiter offerings.  While there are some nifty little vignettes on Route 66, NASCAR racing, etc., they are just that: little.  There is no director's commentary either.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong - there is a LOT to like about this film.  The voices are supurb, as usual.  The races are exciting, the sound is crisp and immersive, and the video is sharp.  The characters are fun and are worthy of inclusion in the Disney pantheon.  But small children will lose interest because the filmakers allowed themselves to meander in the middle 1/2 of the film.",Cars
809622,B000H7I6CU, A1MS5NAPEGKEXZ,5.0, Great movie,"Great movie for kids.  I love that it has a positive message.  I would change a thing or two such as, I think they refer to one of the cars as being an idiot at one point but compared to a lot of the other ""kid"" movies out there it doesn't have a lot of questionable content.  My 2 and a half year old loves it and would watch it all day every day if I allowed it.",Cars
809623,B000H7I6CU, A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,3.0," Admired it, but couldn't love it","An arrogant young race car (Owen Wilson) has his eyes opened to what really matters in life when he finds himself stranded in Radiator Springs, a forgotten little town on Route 66 where folks still care about each other.<br /><br />There is a lot to enjoy in this movie.  The animation is spectacular, the voice talent is top-notch, and it presents good lessons about respect for the simple, enduring pleasures of life and the false allure of fame.  Despite these strengths and some good laughs, I didn't connect with this film on an emotional level.  I think I just wasn't captivated by the concept of characters developed from cars, but my two-year-old son certainly was, and his opinion probably counts more than mine.",Cars
809624,B000H7I6CU, A2KKQ2K4O2GY2Y,5.0, great kids movie with very little violence and NO death - wow!,"Cars is about the only feature length movie that my little kids can watch without having to be afraid that the main character(s) are going to be killed.  How is it that so many ""kids"" movies feature scene after scene of the animated characters (usually animals) running for their lives under the threat of death?  ""Finding Nemo"" coming to mind right away.  Not only all that issue, but the movie starts with the mother and all of Nemo's siblings getting killed.  Do children really need to contemplate this possibility?  I also checked out ""A Bug's Life.""  The grasshoppers are really scary, threaten the life of the little ant, Dot, and also plan to kill the reigning Queen.  Then there's the scene with the bird trying to eat them.  And of course the end where Flick maneuvers Hopper into a location so that he can get captured by a bird, and then - of all things! - fed to the baby birds.<br /><br />I really don't understand why kids movies, in general, feature that kind of ""life and death"" tension.  Plenty of adult movies don't have those themes and are nonetheless compelling.  And that's what we have with Cars.  No one is trying to kill anyone - whew!  And although Chick Hicks is ""the bad guy"" and ""a meanie,"" he's only is a small portion of the movie.  And the aggressive stuff he does is pushing and shoving the other cars, which isn't great, but at least it's not some animated animal punching, kicking, biting, and/or stomping on another.  Chick Hicks aside, the main storyline of the movie is about Lightening McQueen's personal growth and what he learns about friendship and life.  These are an appropriate topics for children to consider, in my opinion!  These are issues that I expect my children to confront in their own lives, unlike (God willing) running for their lives and/or getting beaten senseless and/or losing family members to acts of violence and/or engineering a situation that results in the death of their ""enemies.""<br /><br />In summation, I wish there were other great, high quality movies out there that can appeal to kids (and adults!) without resulting to violence and death as motivating factors for the characters.  Cars proves that we can be motivated by other things than these, such as what it means to have a friend and be a friend.",Cars

The movie is sure to be a hit with the kids, but falls short in one area that other Pixar films have excelled -- appeal to adults.  I viewed this one once, and will probably leave it on the shelf for the sake of completeness, but I can't see watching it again, like I have with Monsters, Inc., or the exceptional WALL-E.  If you're looking for something to entertain the kids, save some money and get it on DVD instead of Blu-Ray.

The product info is wrong, this edition doesn't feature French nor Spanish subtitles, so Amazon should update the product specs.

809640,B000H7I6CU, ARFCORBCTKX1J,4.0, It just misses... (That's an auto joke. Get it? Tom and Ray would...),"There aren't any new plots, and most stories have predictable endings. Pixar's success has been the result of paying more attention to the journey than the destination -- it's the unexpected ways the plots are worked out, and clever surprises along the way that make the telling of the story fresh (or at least seem fresh).<br /><br />""Cars"" is the tale of Lightning McQueen, an arrogant, self-centered race car who has to learn that winning isn't everything, and that one's path through life is more important than the destination. We've seen all this before, but Lasseter & friends handle it with some degree of subtlety, with the story driven by character, not plot. (See my review of ""Spirited Away"", which is basically the same story, but developed very, very badly.) And there are some grin-inducing surprises, such as the cow-tipping sequence. The ending is also pleasing -- Lightning decides that winning the big race is not the most-important thing, and is amply rewarded in other ways.<br /><br />""Cars"" is a good film, but not quite up to the standards of most of the preceding Pixars. Why, I can't say. All the parts are present, but the pistons just don't seem to be firing at full power. Perhaps not enough time is spent with the secondary characters. I intend to watch ""Cars"" again, but mostly to catch all the little details, gags, and asides I missed the first time. Unlike the ""Toy Story""s, ""A Bug's Life"", or ""The Incredibles"", it's not a film I'm likely to watch because I feel like some mood-lifting fun. It's all a bit too mechanical. (Your mileage may vary.)<br /><br />The extras are of the generally high quality one expects from Pixar. The ""making of"" is, if anything, too short -- one would like to know more about the people Lasseter met along Route 66. ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" is amusing but ultimately pointless (it was apparently a deleted sequence -- Mater suggests that he and Lightning stay up to look for the ghostlight, but they don't -- and was animated as a DVD bonus), while ""One-Man Band"" is witty and a beautiful piece of CGI animation. (No one has yet matched Pixar, aesthetically or technically.)<br /><br />I'm surprised Disney's 1951 cartoon ""Susie, the Little Blue Coupe"", an obvious influence, isn't included. Regardless of how one might feel about the typically cute/sentimental story, it's a pleasure to watch a cartoon short subject made with as much attention to detail and quality as a feature film.<br /><br />PS: Disney HD showed ""Cars"" last night, and I watched because I had nothing better to do that I felt like doing. My feelings haven't changed. ""Cars"" lacks the surprises and twists of most other Pixar films, chugging its way to a predetermined finish. It just isn't much fun.",Cars
809641,B000H7I6CU, A2RHV42BTJSVON,5.0, Pixar's Best Film to Date...,"With thew somewhat dissapointing ""Rattatouille"", you may find yourself wondering ""Does Pixar still have magic?  Or are they being eaten by the Disney Moster?""  It is a legitimate question, and one that I will answer with one word: CARS.<br /><br />  You may find yourself scratching your head in confusion because I say it is Paxiar's best to date, which would mean it is better than the ""Toy Story"" films and ""Finding Nemo"".  The reason this claim has been made is because although ""Toy Story"" and ""Finding Nemo"" were amazing, ""Cars"" succeeds on a few ways that those movies do not.<br /><br />  Let us start with a synopsis.  This movie has an extremely simple premise; a race car with the name ""Lightning McQueen"" (voiced by Owen Wilson"" is living life in the ""fast lane"".  He is letting life pass him by so that he can be the youngest car to ever win a Piston Cup.  He is on the brink of winning it when by accident he winds up in a redneck town called ""Radiatory Springs"".  It seems to have frozen in time, and after Mcqueen tears the roads to shreds he is sentenced to community service, and well, these simple minded people of course teach him the point lessons he has failed to learn up to that point.<br /><br />  The story on paper sounds mundane, but it is the visuals that are stunning (even by Pixar's standards) and the characters that bring this tale to life.  What makes this movie so good is that it will touch your heart, and remind you that there is more to life than trying to succeed, and that sometimes slowing down and just taking a drive to look at the scenery is a more satisfying than winning another trophy. It is the kind of movie that children and adults alike can enjoy. It has funny and animated characters for children like ""Tow Mater"" (Voiced to perfection by Larry the Cable Guy), more serious characters like ""Doc"" that is embittered, and sober-minded.<br /><br />  While most these characters or characters like them are in other Pixar movies, that are just not as well fleshed out as they here.  Even if we cannot agree with me on this, we can agree that the visuals here are so amazing that you will forget you are watching a ""cartoon"".  This is one animated movie that will stand the test of time fifty years down the road and will be considered a great classic as well as a milestone in computer animation.<br /><br />  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!!<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy",Cars
809642,B000H7I6CU, A3A3NTK5K3DD18,5.0, This is the best toy-oriented movie since Toy Story!,"The movie is great. Some things could be improved like why McQueen has its original colors in the final race instead of having the new ""Radiator Springs"" colors (as it appeared at the end). My son loves it and he didn't stop seeing this movie at home since the release of the DVD.<br /><br />Only this movie and Toy Story have the revolutionary idea of thinking about the movie AND the toys. The others only have the typical ""not-so-look-alike"" figures or not-so-funny-to-play-with toys.<br /><br />This movie brought us the great idea of mixing the Matchbox/HotWheels collection with the movie characters. My son loves any type of toy cars like most of the boys (and many men) but he loves die-cast cars by far.<br /><br />There isn't any movie that used this option (die-cast cars) for its characters and the idea of a growing collection set. That's why I think there is innovation in this movie.<br /><br />I hope they give us a second movie (and more die-cast cars).",Cars

809725,B000H7I6CU, A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,5.0, Stop and Smell the Pavement,"Race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has had a fantastic rookie season and could easily become the first rookie to win the coveted Piston Cup.  All he has to do is win the run off race against veteran The King (Richard Petty) and perpetual runner up Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  If he can do that, he might be able to get a new sponsor.  After all, being the spokescar for Rust-Eze is a little embarrassing for a sleek racecar like Lightning.<br /><br />On the way to the big race in Los Angeles, Lightning accidentally gets separated from his transport truck and finds himself in Radiator Springs, where he accidentally destroys the road.  Much to his dismay, he's sentenced to repave the road before he can continue on the way.<br /><br />Radiator Springs is the town that time forgot.  A former way station on the famous Route 66, it is barely surviving now that the big interstate has been build nearby, making stopping there no longer necessary.  Of course, this is exactly the type of town Lightning wants to avoid.  He's living life in the fast lane and just wants to get on his way.<br /><br />But to complete his community service, he has to deal with the locals.  Mater the Tow Truck (Larry the Cable Guy) quickly labels Lightning his best friend and wants to help him have a good time.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is cute and distracts the rather single focused Lightning.  In fact, everyone in town seems to enjoy having Lightning around.  Everyone but Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).  What kind of secret might he have?  And will Lightning take what he is learning to heart?<br /><br />This movie might bore kids.  More so then other Pixar films, the main conflict is internal, focused on what Lightening is learning from his experiences in Radiator Springs.  There is a villain, but he gets little screen time.  And this is the first movie to not have on of Pixar's patented climaxes that will not quit.<br /><br />All this isn't to say that the movie is bad.  I saw it twice in the theater, and loved every minute of it both times.  The story is ultimately heartwarming, the characters endearing, and the movie is funny.  The tractor-tipping scene alone is guaranteed to make you laugh.  Plus there is lots of fun during and after the final credits.<br /><br />And then there's Pixar's attention to detail.  Watching the car's backup lights turn on and off or the bugs being VW Beetles, for example, add to the charm.  The animation in the movie is flawless, and many of the scenery shots are absolutely breathtaking.  If I didn't know better, I would say they were real.  This is a movie to watch on the big screen for those shots alone.<br /><br />Surprisingly, this is the first Pixar film not to get a two disc special edition.  Frankly, I find that disappointing.  Still, the movie looks and sounds wonderful.  There's a new short with Mater, deleted scenes, and the ""One Man Band"" short that showed in theaters before this movie.<br /><br />While kids might not find it as engaging as Pixar's other films, they will enjoy it.  The lack of extras is disappointing, but the film more then makes up for it.  This is another triumph for Pixar.",Cars
809726,B000H7I6CU, A2CR2NTBGBR2XM,5.0, Good Movie but no Fast Play,"I didn't see this in the theater.  My 18 month old & my 3 year old are not ready for the big screen yet.  But we did buy it the day it came out.  We are watching it now and it is quite enjoyable.  So far the only fault I have with it is there is no Fast Play.  With my kids, fast play is essential.  So just know when you buy it, you'll have to manualy press play.",Cars
809727,B000H7I6CU, A50VTX48VKWRJ,5.0, One of the best,All I can say is this is one of the best movies that Disney has released in years and my favorite so far this year.,Cars
809728,B000H7I6CU, A3RMAWK4ELOLRZ,4.0, Cars,"Lightning McQueen is a cocky, self-centered racecar (voiced by Owen Wilson) who thinks winning is everything.  One day while going to California, McQueen gets left in the middle of the street (accidentally of course).  He goes to Radiator Springs where he accidentally tears up the road.  McQueen is sentenced to fix the road.  While at Radiator Springs, McQueen has a change of heart; he finds out the true meaning of winning is not actually getting the most trophies, it's being a good sport and believing in yourself.<br /><br />..also starring the voice talents of Bonnie Hunt as Sally, and Paul Newman as Doc, cars in Radiator Springs.<br /><br />This is a really good movie!  It has its funny moments.  The cars Guido and Luigi had my dad and I laughing hysterically!!  I don't know about my dad, but this film gave me a warm feeling inside once I left the theatre.",Cars
809729,B000H7I6CU, A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y,2.0, Doc Hollywood Rehashed,"I have never been into Cars. I am not into NASCAR and I drive Fords older than the audience this movie is intended for. The movie is beautifully done. The digitized west look good, not as good as the real thing, but very good. The plot of this movie is basically ""Sullivan Travels"" or more exactly ""Doc Hollywood."" There is a little ""An officer and a Gentlemen"" thrown in, but the plot is basically a highly successful city dweller gets stuck in the country, learns simplicity is sometimes better, develops sympathy and mercy for his fellow man, and finds love. Since I did not have the ""Car"" tie in, I found this movie rather boring. I rather watch ""Doc Hollywood"" again. Another thing that put me off was that though the cars vaguely resemble the actors who did their voices, I found the cars rather hard to sympathesize with. I found the faces emotionless. I wasn't rooting for the characters very much, except perhaps the tow truck.",Cars
809730,B000H7I6CU, A2ZD1N8FMVJGR7,4.0, Disney Formula Movie...for Boys,"This movie followed the Disney formula to a ""t""---a little non sexual romance, in jokes for the parents and older children, simple story line with clear good guys and bad guys spelled out---except this time, it was directed more for the little ""princes"" than the ""princesses"".  Not that both won't enjoy it. Like Finding Nemo, it was a completely enjoyable little film to entertain your children.  However, unlike Finding Nemo, there was no real depth to the film.<br /><br />Take it for what it is and you'll like it very much.  It's VERY good but not a future classic.",Cars
809731,B000H7I6CU, A2CL51UHVMAQ0F,5.0, LOVE IT,We watch CARS all the time.  Everyone in the house enjoys the show. We had to get a couple of replacement DVDs of this show we like  it that much around here.,Cars
809732,B000H7I6CU, A2N7SBFCW3CC3X,4.0, Great Movie; stinks no Digital Copy,This is Cars; by Pixar. It is a great movie - my only feedback for Disney on this would be to include the digital copy but they are offering a discount on the Disney online version. down to $5.99 - amazing since this option is free with other Disney movies such as the Toy Story and the Incredibles.<br /><br />I would wait to buy this movie and see if they offer a version with the digital copy!,Cars
809733,B000H7I6CU, A34TNH973Q9XT0,3.0," Not bad, but not good either","I have enjoyed many G rated ""kiddie"" movies over the years, but this is not one that I would ever watch again.  The movie starts off somewhat exciting, but as soon as you start to get into the action, it becomes boring and uneventful.  I felt like the majority of the movie was like a long, slow story about how the main character learns humility.  Okay, maybe this would have been okay, but not for most of the movie.  Somewhere along the lines there has to be more action and humor.  The funny moments are few and far between.  Most of the humor relies on jokes about how the other characters are presented.  How this is supposed to be funny for a over an hour is beyond me.  You giggle about how the characters talk for a few minutes and then you look for more, but you don't get it.  After all of this, the movie has a rather boring ending that almost makes you feel let down after you have waited for so long for more action.  In the end I would have to say that this one is a rental only.  I would never watch it again and the kids that I know were all unimpressed.  Nobody asked Santa for this one.",Cars
809734,B000H7I6CU, AO50Q84BKQ2WF,3.0, A Parent's Revie,"I have to admit.  I was really looking forward to this movie.  I mean really.  The teaser that had been playing for almost two years during previous visits to the theater with my 3 kids left me giddy with excitement.  Okay, yes, I acknowledge that I am strange, yet I am not alone, I assure you of that.  Like millions of others, I have come to expect from Pixar Films intelligent, witty, and charming productions that serve up as many laughs (if not more) for adults as for their diminutive counterparts.  I mean, it's to the point where I am more excited to go to the films my eleven-year-old is now beginning to outgrow.<br /><br />So, I was looking forward to ""Cars"" and perhaps my expectations were too high.  While it was charming and sweet in a safe sort of way, the film just lacks the spunk and general pizzazz that we have come to expect from the people who brought us ""Toy Story"", ""A Bug's Life"", ""Finding Nemo"", and ""The Incredibles"".  Lacking in cultural allusions, innuendo, and similar word play, the film is just okay.  Perhaps the fact that the main writing of the screenplay is credited to three writers with virtually nothing under their belts is an indication of why this venture lacks the expected luster of a Pixar movie.<br /><br />And yet...some questions I need to ask myself...<br /><br />Is it fun and appropriate for its target audience?  Yes.<br /><br />Does it have a nicely wrapped-up moral that is delivered well, but not too heavily?  Sure.<br /><br />Are the visuals bright and fun to look at for about an hour and a half?  Absolutely.<br /><br />So, was it torture to sit and watch it with my kids?  No.<br /><br />Most importantly, my kids liked it and it still beats ""Baby Geniuses"" by a long shot. And yet, it is with more reservation that I will walk into a Pixar film in the future...although I will admit that the teaser for ""Ratatouille"" looks great!",Cars
809735,B000H7I6CU, A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,3.0, How many laps was that?!,"In the end, after a long race and countless detours, Cars comes swinging around the final turn with a pretty nice message about life. About winning and losing. About how to win ... and how to lose. It's a message you hear often enough, but usually it's simply an empty truism without much heart. ""It's not if you win or lose, but how you play the game,"" etc., ad nauseum. Cars communicates that message in a genuine, heartfelt way that can't help but reach young and old alike. That, in the end, is what is really good about this film. And, in the end, it's also the most important thing in any movie for children: Do they learn something of lasting value that otherwise might be lost upon them?<br /><br />But, unfortunately, Cars lacks the pacing, vitality, and spirit of Pixar's other films.  The story feels like an early draft that should have been cut and polished -- and cut and polished again. Sequences seem interminable. Points get hashed and rehashed. Movies, especially those for little ones, need to be economical, not bloated. They need to know the point where the length of a scene may destroy its vitality -- and then cut it back way before then. Pixar's done it right so many times, that I've come to take it for granted that its writers are champs at it. Not here.<br /><br />The overwrought nature of the story, coupled with a lack of the adult-oriented (and amusing) subtext that keeps parents interested in the great children's films, makes for a very long ride indeed for folks over forty. In addition, many of the characters seemed like ""cookie cutter"" cliches, something that seemed wholly unnecessary and not exactly a view of the world that's good for tender ears.<br /><br />Maybe Cars, when it reaches the shelves on DVD, will result in a first among director's cuts: a shorter movie.<br /><br />Nah. It'll never happen.",Cars
809736,B000H7I6CU, ACJTUFZEUCCBL,5.0," Contests are fun, but they are not Life","""Cars"" is the first Pixar movie I did not buy immediately. But finally I got tired of waiting for the rental copy, and I bought it.<br /><br />The delay was due to the trailer not really doing much for me. Also, I felt that cars is a dubious choice for animated characters. Unlike bugs or toys, they don't have arms or faces, so it's a little forced, methinks.<br /><br />That said, I'd have to say they pulled it off. Actually, looking at real cars after having seen this movie, I half expect them to move and open their eyes.<br /><br />""Cars"" is not the best or funniest Pixar movie. My faves are Monsters Inc, Toy Story 2, and The Incredibles. But ""Cars"" was still very worthwhile, I enjoyed it. And it is visually gorgeous. The scenery especially is amazing.<br /><br />If you get the DVD, be sure not to miss the extras. The two shorts included, for one thing, are falling-over funny.<br /><br />I also appreciate the basic message of the movie: winning is not everything. The western world is still a bit fixated on Being Number One. And contests can be fun and they can be inspiring, but ultimately they are just games, they are not life.",Cars

809740,B000H7I6CU, A140XH16IKR4B0,4.0, Sentimental Highway,"Pixar's last collaboration with Disney turns out to be a sweetly sentimental picture about days gone by - about the fast pace of the present leaving behind the ""simpler"" days of bygone years.<br /><br />""Cars"" is the interesting final act in a marriage between the most original maker of animated pictures and the marketing behemoth better know for its tried, trite and formulaic films. The film is completely predictable. Once we are introduced to self-sufficient, arrogant racecar ""Lightning McQueen,"" only the most obtuse of viewers could fail to predict that he will somehow learn the requisite lessons that 1) We All Must Rely On Others and 2) We Must All Slow Down To See The Beauty Arounf Us. Add a love interest, a motley collection  of oddballs and a bitter old racer who has turned his back on his old love of racing, and you have a potential carnival of clich&eacute;s. But ""Cars"" pretty much gets past banality to deliver a movie that is breathtaking to watch, often funny and almost moving.<br /><br />""Cars"" waxes rhapsodic about the pre-interstate experience of driving in which the journey, not the destination, was most important. The film adulates the old Route 66, with its neon-emblazoned motels, gas stations and drive-ins. It should probably not shock anyone that these establishments could be ugly, uncomfortable and lonely in their own right. But ""Cars"" lets us see their beautiful side, in which they catered to the basic needs of travelers of the 1950s and 60s while reflecting the values of their era.<br /><br />Animated or not, ""Cars"" is a crashing bore for the little kids. The soundtrack veers too much toward mawkishness, and the languid vistas conjured up by the filmmakers are too glorious for small minds. There's too much story, too much unfathomable nostalgia and not enough racing. The kids in the theater where I saw the film were losing their minds.<br /><br />But for those of us with a bit of wear on our tires, ""Cars"" gets us where we want to go - a few minutes rest from the hustle-bustle of the Highway We Call Life.",Cars

Sometimes all in the same day.<br /><br />Thankfully my husband and I like this one too. It's wonderful to see the characterization of Richard Petty, his wife and Dale Jr. along with other drivers.

Even though they are 4 years apart in age (5 year old boy, 9 year old girl), they both enjoy watching it and have seen it several more times since the holidays.  One of the reasons I like it is that there is no ""bad guy"" as you often find in other Disney/kids movies.  And for adults (who often have to sit there and watch the movie as well!), there are a lot of ""cameo"" appearances, via voice, of famous NASCAR-related characters which keep it interesting.

809746,B000H7I6CU, A16IITISD2LAX0,5.0," Movie of the Year to me an old guy. Great for kids, too","My wife and I watched the DVD three weeks ago at home and immediately regarded it as ""Movie of the Year"". The CG is stunning as expected, but it's success is primarily attributed to the great story/script and the outstanding details which captivate its audience all the way. I had the impulse to write a review immediately then but had been stopped by the many negative reviews that complained it's too targeted at adults and not so good for kids as other Pixar movies. I thought, ""May be I am really too old (40) and so I have rated too high an animaion that tributed to the aged or the veterans."" However, last night, when we were in a mall watching an AV shop showing it in a 42"" 1080P True HD Sony LCDTV, together with many little kids and their parents, we were attracted not only by the fantastic video effect (We only have a 29"" CRT at home and were astonished by how much visual details we missed), but how parents got to drag/pull/tow their kids away. In one case, a father simply put his 3-4 yr old son on his shoulder like a bag of flour and walked away. The cute beautiful angel, with his smiling face, waived ""Bye! Bye! Car, Car.""",Cars
809747,B000H7I6CU, A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,5.0, Another Animation Success,"Pixar has proven its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.<br /><br />But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by harkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.<br /><br />The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win ""The Piston Cup."" But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on ""the highway."" Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.<br /><br />Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.<br /><br />That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout.",Cars
809748,B000H7I6CU, A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,5.0," Toys, fish, cars...what's next?","If Pixar can pull off an excellent movie about talking cars, they can do anything.<br /><br />When I first heard about Cars, I was a bit underwhelmed.  Talking cars?  Well, Pixar had hit gold with talking fish but...cars?  I personally had doubts about this movie, but when I came out of watching it, I was very satisfied and pleasantly suprised.<br /><br />Much like Pixar's previous films, Cars is a story diven film.  And with only three real action scenes in the entire film (two at the beginning, one at the end), it depends on it's story to stay afloat and keep the audience interested.  And i'm happy to say that the film kept my interest the entire way through.<br /><br />Cars follows a hot and fast upcoming racer named Lightning McQueen, a racecar who will stop at nothing to get to the top and become the champion.  However, on his way to a tie-breaker race, he becomes lost in a little route 66 town that's fallen off the map.  Here, high and mighty ego clashes with small town slowness and McQueen undergos a personal journey to find himself and what really matters in his life.<br /><br />When trying to think of negatives for this movie...I can't think of any. There really is nothing wrong with Cars. There are no weak points that immediatly come to mind. It pulls your emotions in the right directions at the right time and for the right amount of time.  I laughed, chuckled and applauded at all the right moments (especially the farting tractors).  So did everyone else in the theater.  Even side charachters, some of whom have only a few lines, are strong and well played.  I'd say that there are no weak charachters in Cars, something that is all too rare these days.  Even those who don't really contribute to the plot (the surplus military jeep for example) are fun to watch.  This is a great film that anyone can watch and enjoy, though action fans might find themselves a bit bored during most of the movie.  It has a great message (sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself), morals about what's really important in life, and what's worth winning, and so much more.  Heck, even a malfunctioning stoplight is enjoyable to watch.  Everyone in the theater that I attended had a blast and enjoyed watching the movie.<br /><br />Cars is easily one of the best films of the year, the kind that you can't stop raving about, and is almost certianly going to be the main contender for best animated feature. This is annother winner for Pixar, and is a great film that everyone should watch at least once.<br /><br />Oh, and be sure to stay for the credits. Trust me on this one.",Cars

The picture is brilliant of course, but the PCM sound at 24 bits will also rock your speakers.  The special in-movie features are the best implementation so far of what blu-ray can offer us.  You can feel the dedication and love when watching them - so removed from some of the tacked on 10 'making of' bits we get even on most blu-ray today.<br />This disk should be held as a standard to other studios when they whine about people not buying enough blu ray.  If every disk were like this I'd be broke buying them.",Cars
809750,B000H7I6CU, A3KY68OTSNHM3G,5.0, Ka Chow!  Cars is a Hit!,"Pixar has struck gold one again with this teriffic movie that's sure to become a classic.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson) is the hottest rookie car on the Piston Cup Circuit, but he's facing a challenge from two other cars: The King (Richard Petty) and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  All three cars are tied going into the final race of the season.  By the end of the race, McQueen has a huge lead over Hicks and The King, but he made a decision not to change tires earlier in the race.  Now, he suffers a blowout, allowing Hicks and The King to catch up.  The race ends in a three-way tie.  It is decided that there will be one winner-take-all race at the Los Angeles International Speedway the following week.  The three cars set off on their cross-country journey.<br /><br />Lightning is riding happily along in the back of his trailer when suddenly, something goes wrong.  Lightning finds himself out of his trailer and in the middle of a crowded interstate.  Meanwhile, his tractor/trailer keeps driving, not realizing Lightning is missing.  Lightning ends up in the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, on Route 66.<br /><br />Lightning's problems begin as soon as he enters town.  He ends up destroying the town's main road, is arrested by the sheriff, and impounded and booted in the town's impound lot.  In the lot, he meets Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old tow truck.  Then, he's taken to the courthouse, where Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences lightning to fix the road before he'll be allowed to go on to his race in California.  There are other interesting cars in Radiator Springs, including Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a hot-looking Porsche who runs the town hotel, Sarge the army jeep, and Flo, owner of Flo's V8 Cafe.  Radiator Falls used to be a bustling town, but since the interstate was built, very few travellers drive through.<br /><br />Lightning begins his job of re-paving the road and he finishes rather quickly, but Doc is unsatisfied with his work, so he tells Lightning to start over.  Frustrated, Lightning begins again.  However, something unexpected has been happening.  Lightning finds himself developing friendships with each car in Radiator Springs, especially Sally. Mater has taken a special liking to Lightning, even taking him tractor tipping. Mater calls Lightning his best friend. He also finds out that Doc is hiding a secret of his own from everyone in town.  Soon, the road is finished, and Lightning is free to go to his race in California.  But he's having second thoughts.  Sally took him for a drive, and Lightning was impressed with the beautiful scenery.  Sally also tells him about how Radiator Springs used to be a hub of activity and how she wishes it would be that way again.  Lightning even gets some new tires and a new paint job.  He doesn't look like the race car he was before.<br /><br />Just as it looks like Lightning has made up his mind to stay in Radiator Springs, the town is besieged by other cars and helicopters, along with Lightning's own truck.  They scoop him up and wisk him off to the race in California, leaving his friends in Radiator Springs surprised and Lightning sad.  Once at the track, Lightning, Hicks, and The King start their race.  The only member in Lightning's pit is his faithful truck, until he hears the voice of Doc Hudson.  All of his friends from Radiator Springs have come to help him.<br /><br />As for the race, Lightning has been trailing The King and Hicks the entire way.  As the race enters its final laps, Hicks slams into The King, causing him to crash on the infield.  Lightning, only inches from the finish line and the Piston Cup Championship, makes a decision that changes his life.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Pixar Studios has turned out some fine animated movies in recent years, but this is one of the best.  The story is both exciting and heartwarming, and its fun to watch Lightning learn that there's more to life than winning races and getting big sponsorships.  Friendship and trust are just as important.  Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Keaton, and Richard Petty bring the animated cars to life in a style that is funny, and you'll find yourself cheering for each one.  Jay Leno, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Dale Waltrip, Mario Andretti, and Bob Costas lend their talents to the collection of cars, too.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Children and adults will enjoy this revved-up and exciting movie.  Ka Chow!",Cars
809751,B000H7I6CU, A3I8KG64KB62F,2.0, Doesn't have broad appeal. Predictable and Un-charming.,"Cars was the first Pixar production to disappoint me. For a family with no interest in automobiles or racing or Nascar, the film had little to offer.<br /><br />The characters weren't anything new. An arrogant lead (who never grew on me), a hick, a fiesty businesswoman type...these are all characters that have been done before. Where were the totally new ideas, like Dory the forgetful fish and Flik the inventor ant?<br /><br />The plot was a transparent recycling of ""Doc Hollywood"", completely devoid of surprises. The audience knew from the moment Lightning McQueen arrived in town, that he would eventually come to love Radiator Springs. And personally, since I didn't care about the characters, the race held no suspense for me at all. It simply didn't matter who won or lost.<br /><br />Aside from a couple of isolated moments of humor, I didn't even laugh until the John Ratzenberger scenes during the credits.<br /><br />I'm sure the film was a lot of fun for John Lasseter to make, but it wasn't as fun for those of us who don't share Lasseter's love of cars.",Cars
809752,B000H7I6CU, A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,3.0, Just for Kids. If They Can Stay Awake.,"""Cars"" is director John Lasseter's tribute to American automobile culture. It rolls his love of NASCAR and fondness for the family road trip into a children's morality tale with a little history lesson. The world of ""Cars"" is a populated by driverless autos, so the characters are all machines. A hotshot, rookie racing car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who thinks of nothing but winning the Piston Cup has one week to get to his race in California. But a mishap en route lands McQueen in traffic court in the southwestern town of Radiator Springs. The town judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), wants the arrogant little racer out of town ASAP, but Porsche prosecutor Sally (Bonnie  Hunt) wants McQueen to pave the town's dilapidated main thoroughfare instead, in hopes that it will bring travelers back to the Route 66 town that they abandoned when the interstate was put through. McQueen is loathe to miss his race, but the townsfolk and a hillbilly tow truck named Mater (Dan Whitney) may change his priorities.<br /><br />""Cars"" is an attractive film that smoothly integrates two aspects of car culture -racing and road trips- into a lesson about friendship and respect and a little history of Route 66 towns. But the script is pedestrian. It's hard to believe that someone thought a bunch of bickering over paving a road would be entertaining. You can tune out large sections of this movie without missing anything. ""Cars"" has a lot of technically impressive animation but really only engages visually at the racetrack. It opens with a bang as cars whiz around the track at the Piston Cup and closes in the same vein, with the tiebreaker race, which is much more involving. I can't say if children would enjoy ""Cars"", but, at 1 hour and 54 minutes, it is tedious and way too long. Since ""Finding Nemo"", Pixar has lost its flare for clever dialogue and distinctive animation that adults can enjoy too. To my mind, if a film is too dull for adults, its' not worth a child's time either. Pixar needs better writers.<br /><br />The DVD (Pixar 2006): Bonus features include 2 animated short films, 4 deleted scenes, the movie's epilogue, and a documentary about the inspiration behind the film. ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" (7 min) is a short film in which Mater gets his comeuppance for playing practical jokes. ""One Man Band' (4 1/2 min) is a short film unrelated to ""'Cars"", in which a couple of street musicians duel for the approval of a little girl. ""Epilogue"" (4 min) is the last part of ""Cars"" that played over the credits. In ""Inspiration for Cars"" (16 min), John Lasseter talks about merging the worlds of racing and road trips, the decline of Route 66, and shares part of the Route 66 road trip that the filmmakers took with ""Route 66: The Mother Road"" author Michael Wallis. Subtitles for the film are available in English only.",Cars

Since the release of TOY STORY in 1995, they have not disappointed in any of their films (I've yet to see Cars 2, Ratatouille and Brave), except A Bug's Life, infusing their movies with not only top-notch talent, but also great stories with very strong positive messages about friendship and family. And of course, the animation is always stunning.<br /><br />Sadly, this would be Paul Newman's final movie before his death.

I love the age-old technique of putting thinly veiled adult themes that aren't offensive to kids (they just think it's funny) but appeal to adults.

809779,B000H7I6CU, A11ED8O95W2103,3.0," Takes a while to get out of first gear, then hauls asphalt.","The first time I tried to watch this movie I turned it off after about 15 minutes.  The beginning of this film is one long torturous session with ""Lightning McQueen"" who is to me the most non endearing character ever in any Pixar movie.  One dumb gag and cliche after another, and some genuinely bad writing, like when McQueen says ""I'm a one man show"".  Hey, there is no ""man"" in the Cars universe, so why would a car say something like that?<br /><br />Thankfully I gave it another chance and decided to watch it on my little flatpanel while walking on my treadmill.  The movie starts to really move when it slows down.  The 116 minutes is considered by some to be too long, but it added a lot of time for character development, and McQueen needed to develop a lot of character.<br /><br />To be brief, the beautifully rendered little world of Radiator Springs and its assortment of cute -- if rather one dimensional -- characters provided a context for McQueen to accept responsibility for his actions, grow up, and start thinking of vehicles other than himself.  The Porsche saved the movie for me.  She at least had some depth.<br /><br />I liked ""Doc"" too.  His story added another lesson to the story, that is, don't discount those who came before you. They're smarter than you think.<br /><br />I found the ending rather predictable (I was sure what would happen, but I just didn't know exactly how it would happen), but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen the movie.<br /><br />So, three stars for a decent morality play and some mind bogglingly beautiful animation, and a tribute to motoring history.  Two stars off for shallow cliche characters (or should I say car-actors) and for having tons of eye-candy but a dearth of adult humor, and by ""adult"" I mean genuinly subtle and funny humor, not crass toilet humor.  With all it's strengths, Cars was a difficult movie for me to emotionally bond with, unlike the other Pixar films.<br /><br />Oh yeah, how is it that McQueen left Radiator Springs with whitewalls and that solid red and white paint pattern and then rolls out of Mac the next morning at the speedway back in his original paint, stickers, and tires.  Did I miss something?<br /><br />And, in real car racing you don't get to purposely collide with other cars and knock them off the track.  Chick Hick would have been banned from auto racing and likely charged with a felony in the real racing world.  They went so far to duplicate the realism of NASCAR, and I know cars sometimes touch, but it ain't supposed to be roller-derby, is it?<br /><br />The bonus featurs are fun, like the ""One Man Band"" cartoon and the extra ""Cars"" cartoon.  The ""deleted scenes"" are storyboard style but show how the movie could have been done differently, which I found quit interesting.<br /><br />Finally, this DVD just seems like ""round one"".  A year from now there will likely be the ""Special Two-Disc Ultra Ka-Chow"" version with multiple commentaries, documentaries, etc.  So, if you buy this version, I think you'll likely be buying Cars again.",Cars
809780,B000H7I6CU, A33ENNU5G60VIH,3.0, Great Movie....horrible DVD.,"Maybe it's me.  I bought this DVD, enhanced for 16 X 9 televisions, and I am less than happy.  All other previous Disney/Pixar movies filled up the screen on my set....this one gives me black bars.

809781,B000H7I6CU, AGKPTMTR3UX1R,2.0," ""Here in my car, I feel safest of all . . .""---Gary Numan","CARS is by far the weakest of the collaborations by Disney and Pixar. The animation is certainly up to Pixar's very high standards. Younger children will love the colorful universe that appears onscreen. CARS is a NASCAR-inspired tale of a world populated strictly by motor vehicles. It is the story of Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), rookie racer nonpareil, who is in a run-off in a three way tie in the Piston Cup. Lightning is young, cocky, self-assured, unpolished, and in love with flash and glitter.<br /><br />On his way to the run-off, Lightning accidentally ends up exiting I-40 to find himself on a forgotten stretch of The Mother Road, Route 66, speeding through the forgotten town of Radiator Springs. Pulled over, he faces the town judge, ""Doc"" Hudson (voiced by Paul Newman, a lifelong racer himself). Doc is about to let Lightning go when the town Attorney Sally Carrera (a Porsche, voiced by Bonnie Hunt), convinces Doc to lock him up for destruction of property. Lightning must do Community Service before he can get on his way.<br /><br />I found myself strangely troubled by CARS. The movie has an odd anti-capitalist cant to it, denigrating success in favor of a retreat into a kind of colorless anonymity. There's nothing wrong at all with caring for one's neighbors or supporting one's community, but having a healthy sense of community does not preclude someone from enjoying their own accomplishments.<br /><br />CARS lacks the heart of the TOY STORY films and FINDING NEMO. Quite surprisingly, the characters in CARS aren't very nice to one another, or, for that matter, nice at all. Lightning is cocky, and riding for a fall. That's OK, it's a classic plotline, but the way it all plays out gave me a distinctly uncomfortable feeling. The morality of CARS is convoluted and unclear, and certainly much more complicated than it should be for a film supposedly directed at children. Personal vendettas underlie much of the film's momentum.<br /><br />Lightning is a self-described ""one man show"" who wants to win the big race in order to get the big bucks and the big endorsements, and has perhaps cheated to make his way into the run-off race.<br /><br />Sally Carerra has Lightning convicted not because of the minor property damage he has caused but because she dislikes the glitz and glam he admires (something she turned her back on when she came to Radiator Springs). She derides Lightning throughout the film by giving him an unkind nickname.<br /><br />Doc turns out to be a world famous retired racer himself, who, after a devastating accident, was unable to make a comeback and was forgotten by a fickle public. Embittered, he retreated to Radiator Springs to brood on his disappointments. Doc wants Lightning to pay the price for his own unhappiness.<br /><br />The rest of the denizens of the town spend most of their time complaining about how the Interstate has passed them by. Their shops are dusty. There's no business. But when Lightning the stranger comes to town, they treat him with all the hick small town xenophobia they can muster. Only Mater, a dopey, buck-toothed and rusty tow truck befriends him, taking him tractor tipping in the night (they get chased off by Frank, an enraged combine). Mater calls Lightning, ""my best friend,"" but Lightning never reciprocates.<br /><br />Ironically, things don't change in Radiator Springs until Lightning repaves the road. The rest of the town's cars get to work, painting and fixing and replacing the burnt-out neon bulbs on the roadside joints. Radiator Springs spruces up, but it definitively says something that not one of the natives bothered to get off their rusty tailpipes to do anything to fix the town until after they force Lightning to do the dirty work.<br /><br />Of course, once they get the place in order, Lightning's their hero. Having learned a lesson about community, Lightning goes on to a surprising finish in the run-off race.<br /><br />With its ethics badly in need of a tune up, I think it'd be all right for your kids to miss CARS.",Cars
809782,B000H7I6CU, AGRJDPB5KQUNC,5.0, PIXAR'S ABSOLUTE BEST FILM EVER!,"Being a fan of Toy Story and A Bug's Life, I used to look forward to a Pixar release. Then came Finding Nemo and The Incredibles: two of the dumbest movies I have ever seen! I went and saw Cars just becuase I'll sit through anything that has to do with cars and motor vehicles. But, to my surprise, the movie was great! This is way better than any of Pixar's other movies. It's a must see!",Cars
809783,B000H7I6CU, A2EDZH51XHFA9B,4.0," Really, only Pixar could make NASCAR entertaining.","Cars (John Lasseter,2006)<br /><br />The main problem I have with Cars will not be shared by the majority of its viewers, nor even the majority of Americans. It's the naked end result of a love affair with NASCAR, and all NASCAR represents. Still, if anyone can take NASCAR and make it worth watching, it's Pixar. And they do a relatively good job of it, despite the instant-death casting moves of putting Owen Wilson and Larry the Cable Guy (are you getting the ""all NASCAR represents"" vibe yet?) in two major roles.<br /><br />Cars is the story of Lightning McQueen (Wilson), a self-absorbed rookie racer who overcomes overwhelming obstacles to finish in a three-way tie for the Piston Cup, racing's greatest honor. (That he put himself in the position to be burdened with overwhelming obstacles is a minor, but important, point.) The talking heads decree that The three finishers-- McQueen, The King (Richard Petty), and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton)-- will have a race-off in California in one week. On the way there, thanks to various shenannigans, McQueen finds himself stranded in the town of Radiator Springs, having caused a great deal of damage to the stretch of Route 66 that passes through the town. The town judge, Doc (Paul Newman), sentences McQueen to repave the section of road he destroyed. Which, of course, leads to McQueen getting to know the locals and coming to care about something other than his own existence. Roll credits, another happy ending in the books.<br /><br />So, yeah, it's predictable. But the predictability doesn't take into account the Pixar magic, which flows as strongly as ever here. And I mean strong-- if it can make me like anything even remotely NASCAR-related (or Larry the Cable Guy related), there's some serious mojo workin' in the Pixar studios.<br /><br />It's not much of a surprise that Cars works as well as it does; Lasseter was the guy behind both Toy Story movies and A Bug's Life, three of Pixar's strongest offerings. He uses the same formula here: lovely animation with a great deal of subtle detail to captivate the eye, fantastic voice casting for minor roles (and little details added by those voice actors that brighten everything up a bunch), and realizing that if you're going to do formula, the best way to do it is to stick with the formula. After all, it's a formula because it works.<br /><br />Pixar strikes again. *** ",Cars

I think it says a lot about the incredible people at Pixar that THIS is probably their weakest film.<br /><br />My major disappointment is with the DVD.  Pixar has always had great ""Special Edition"" DVD releases. With each film they've improved the features. They usually have close to an hour's worth of `behind the scenes' documentaries.  And they weren't released as a special edition at a later date.<br /><br />On Cars, it's about 15 minutes and includes NO `making of' content.  It's a good feature about John Lasseter's inspiration for the story.<br /><br />Usually, there are features about story development, animation techniques and other insights into the creative process that follows the years of work involved in making these films.<br /><br />The Incredibles had tons of  Behind the Scenes features as well as 2 commentary tracks with writers and animators, giving you over 6 hours of extra content.<br /><br />Over these many films, I have come to know and love the creators as much or more than the films themselves. I was a lot more excited about purchasing this DVD than my kids were.<br /><br />Pixar truly had captured the `magic' that used to be Disney Animation, even in the Walt-style `behind-the-scenes' features.  Then, Disney, who in recent years has given us `creative triumphs' such as Cinderella 2, Little Mermaid 2, Beauty and the Beast 2 and  Lion King 2 and 3, bought Pixar.<br /><br />I don't think it's a coincidence that the first Pixar release since the Disney buyout is being sold for the same $20.00 price, with minimal content.  Disney is clearly going for bigger profits and ripping off fans of Pixar.

Not only does he know it, he advertises it too so he's not really a likable character.<br /><br />He is so sure of himself he is more than happy to speed on the on the road, in his arrogance he thinks he is above the law so he when he crashes into the Hill Billy town of Radiator Springs and ends up causing lots of damage he is not too happy to be sentenced to do community service to pay his debt to society.<br /><br />Lightning isn't a happy car and he all he wants to do is get away from Radiator Springs but that is going to be easier said than done and you are not sure if community service is going to make any difference to Lightning whose dreams are of the big city, lights fame and racing.<br /><br />There is a star studded cast of voices, and they do a pretty good job, Paul Newman is great as the wise old Doc Hudson and you can't help smiling at Ramon, voiced by Cheech of Cheech and Chong.<br /><br />All in all a nice little film like I said earlier, quirky and fun but nothing spectacular when I think of other animated movies I have seen over the years, not really worth going to the movies to see unless you are a real fan of Disney/Pixar, and I guess the big screen does it justice but personally I'd wait for it to come out on DVD.",Cars

809812,B000H7I6CU, AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,4.0, The Moose Hole - Life is a Highway,"The courtship between the Walt Disney Corporation and Pixar Animation Studios has been at best a tumultuous one to say the least about it. Former-Disney Chairman/CEO Michael Eisner deserves most of the blame however. He and Steve Jobs, Chairman/CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, were at each other's throats throughout their nearly decade long partnership together. Even after the astonishing break-out success of honorary Oscar recipient Toy Story in 1995, Eisner had yet to be convinced of Pixar's potential. Rather then buy Pixar straight-out, which would have been the smart and economically efficient thing to do, Disney instead negotiated to extend their three-picture distribution deal to five movies. Things became even direr after Disney theatrically released Toy Story 2 in 1999 which had been originally produced with the intention of it premiering direct-to-video. Pixar believed it should count as part of their five-picture deal with Disney but Eisner argued that it was negotiated outside of their contract and did not count. Disney's efforts to (no pun intended) drown Finding Nemo in the midst of the summer season, which failed miserably as it went on to become the highest grossing animated film of all time, surpassing The Lion King, further emboldened Jobs to seek a corporate divorce, if only to rid himself of Michael Eisner. Disaster was averted however when Michael Eisner chose, forcefully or not, to step down from his position aboard the Walt Disney Company allowing his replacement, Robert Iger, to woe Pixar back to Disney. With Eisner now out of the picture, Jobs, with no contention against the Disney Corporation anymore, agreed to sell the animation giant to the company for seven-billion dollars, far more then it would have been had Eisner chosen to buy them out ten years ago.<br /><br />The story for Cars can easily be identified as the source of the movie's problems but precisely pinpointing the exact cause is a bit more difficult. While there is nothing particularly wrong with it per say - it is sweet and well meaning - it comes off as being far too generic. This is the exact same predicament the Brad Bird directed Pixar project, The Incredibles, was faced with two years ago. However, The Incredibles was in the end still able to be overtly entertaining in spite of this tremendous handicap. Cars, on the other hand, is not nearly as successful as its predecessor was. Time is not a factor, at least not on its face. Cars' one-hundred and fourteen minute time-length is on par with the running time for The Incredibles and yet Cars is the one that feels more drawn out. Lightning's trip to California, for example. While it does successfully `show off' Pixar's artistic prowess (emphasis added), it does nothing to better accommodate the flow of the story. Instead it smacks of pride and daresay smugness on the part of Pixar Animation and should have been shortened down. Even Lightning's community service sentence in Radiator Springs feels force fed. That said however Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway' is put to expedient use in this scene. And then unlike past Pixar films there is no distinctive villain to help chart the path of the film's protagonist. But then again this fails to explain Finding Nemo's success in terms of plot and character development. Regardless of what the true source of the problems is, Cars in spite of foreseeable plot devices still remains a cut above the rest of the mainstream box office.<br /><br />The decision to cast comedic-actor Owen Wilson as the lead in Disney/Pixar's Cars did not bring quite the level of anticipation or enthusiasm as Craig T. Nelson for The Incredibles or Albert Brooks in Finding Nemo had in their respected roles. In spite of his fairly consistent appearance in such artistic independent films as The Life Aquatic and The Royal Tenenbaums for director Wes Anderson, Wilson is judged mostly on his more frequent appearance in low-level comedies like Shanghai Knights, Zoolander, Starsky and Hutch, and Wedding Crashers which make the choice to cast him as the lead in a Pixar film a bit odd. Slowly but surely Wilson proves he is up to the challenge. Furthermore, there is more to the character makeup of Lightening McQueen then what lies on the surface. French political philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville in his famous political analysis Democracy in America warned of the greatest threat facing the newborn nation America and its principles of liberty, freedom and democracy - individualism. Not the rugged individualism which vastly shaped this nation's western frontier throughout the 1800s but rather the individualism which leads people only to think of themselves and withdraw further from the community at large. It is the kind of `no-fault freedom' Senator Rick Santorum describes in his book It Takes a Family as the ability to ""check out from the pursuit of the common good and to do what feels right for me, without regard to those around me"". It is a bit of stretch, true, to go from discussing high-level political-science canon to a children's film about a world entirely inhabited by living, breathing cars. Regardless, the basic principle remains the same. Younger children will likely not pick up on the social-political implications of the message this film expresses just yet, maybe a few years down the road - if they are being educated properly, but adults will. Their embrace of the film and its message will make all the difference.<br /><br />Cars will likely be one of the last, if not THE last, films for fellow car enthusiast and acting legend Paul Newman (Cool Hand Luke, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid). He definitely goes out in style as the abrupt doctor of a simple town who hides a secret past. Say what you want about Larry the Cable Guy, even ardent fans would agree that his feature film debut, Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector, was a bit of an embarrassment, but there's no denying the fact that he steals the show with his hick antics as Mater which is just like ""tuh-mater, but without the `tuh'"".<br /><br />Few will likely notice without examining the cast list first that Michael Keaton (Batman, Mr. Mom, White Noise, Herbie: Fully Loaded, etc.) is the voice of the quasi-villain, or as close to a villain as the film gets, Chick Hicks. Kudos both to the casting director and especially to Keaton himself who disguises his voice brilliantly in order to create a rather suspicious character.<br /><br />And hearing Formula One-winner Michael Schumacher as well as NASCAR legends Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mario Andretti, Darrell Waltrip, and Richard Petty, along with his wife, Lynda, provide the voices of their motor-vehicle counterparts in the film is definitely a surprising added bonus. Even car enthusiast/late-night talk-show host Jay Leno gets in on the act making a very brief cameo as Jay Limo early in the movie.<br /><br />Overall, Cars, the seventh computer-animated project from the creative and talented folks at Pixar Animation Studios, not to mention their very last film before the Disney buyout, is sadly their worst to date. This is more of an insult to the movie industry overall however. Even on their worst day Pixar still manages to produce a product that is superior then the majority of what is out in the market right now - animated or otherwise. Optimistically, it's about average. While some pessimists will be quick to label Cars as a step backward for the company and ultimately a failure, alternatively it can be said that director John Lassester, intentionally or not, successfully reintroduces the basic storytelling principles and heart which he himself installed in the company with Toy Story and A Bug's Life in 1995 and 1998 respectively as it makes the transition from an independent entity into another cog in the Disney machine. It is difficult to pin down precisely what is wrong with this film. For one it felt as the though the level of anticipation for this film was no where near as high as it should have been for a Pixar release in summer when everyone is out of school. Marketing may be to blame for dropping the ball on this one, at least in part. Cars was sold too much to the male-driven (no pun intended) NASCAR crowd that it practically alienated the female demographic. That said however it is not entirely marketing's fault. While it is not beyond reason to believe that children or even some adults for that matter may wonder what toys do when humans are not around or whether fish and bugs talk, it is quite a stretch to believe that someone out there truly wants to know what the world would be like if it was entirely inhabited by cars. And unlike fish, toys, monsters, and, yes, even bugs, cars are just not cuddly. It is therefore practically impossible to sell a love story to young girls when it is between two cold pieces of metal, essentially. In addition there is nothing in Cars - visually or otherwise - that really sticks out in your mind when you leave the theatre. Sure, the scene with Mater and Lighting sneaking into the field to go `tractor tipping' is cute and all but it's nothing compared to the scene in Finding Nemo with Dory speaking whale or Mike and Sulley `practicing' for the company musical called `Put That Thing Back Where It Came From or So Help Me' from Monsters, Inc. Not to be so negative about Cars, there are some bright spots. Randy Newman returns to Pixar in top form with an incredible accompanying musical score. And the soundtrack to the film has to be one of the best in the studios' history. It features excellent new additions like Sheryl Crow's `Real Gone' and `Find Yourself' from country artist Brad Paisley as well as some classic tunes like `Route 66' performed by Chuck Berry and Rascal Flatts' version of `Life is a Highway'. Cars is no where near the disaster some had predicted it would be but neither is it the best we could have hoped for.",Cars

Why in this world this thieves at Disney didn't include an English and Spanish audio tracks in the same DVD, or at least included Spanish subtitles along with the English track. They didn't do it because they wanted to squeeze more money out from their loyal customers, and force them to buy two copies of the same movie, one in English and one in Spanish.<br /><br />I never go to the movies at the theater because mi wife doesn't understand English. I usually wait for the DVD release and buy it for the enjoyment of the movie at my home, playing it in my already expensive home theater system. Thus, if a movie doesn't have Spanish (audio or subtitles) I simply don't buy it. But I had to buy this one because my kids.<br /><br />My kids and I do speak English and we watch the DVD with English audio, given my kids prefer it that way. But when I watch the movie together with my wife we do it with Spanish audio or at least with Spanish subtitles (yes, I commonly watch movies twice). This time, with Cars' DVD, my wife was left out the enjoyment, of course, unless I buy the Spanish version.<br /><br />I've bought every DVD Disney has produced and sold in the past 5 years, but a rip off like this makes me think in piracy as an option....

Maybe OK as a family-friendly film, but certainly not on a level with Shrek, Toy Story, Little Mermaid, etc.  Nice animation, but it takes a little more than that to keep my attention; celebrity voices don't do it for me either. I sometimes wonder if the people who write these movies would work a little harder if they didn't have well-known people doing the voices - it seems like they think people will watch the movie just because Paul Newman or whoever is doing a voice.  I also think the people who make this type of movie feel that because there are so few quality family/children's movies that they can put anything they want on the screen and people will go to see it because they need something to take the kids to.

I think that, for the most part, the world agrees that `Cars' is one of Pixar's weakest films.  They may not loathe it as I do, but I don't think anyone is going to try and make a case for `Cars' being a better film than `Up' or `Finding Nemo'.  What I find upsetting is that people actually like this film at all.<br /><br />It's not funny, it's not witty, it's not charming, it's not fresh, it's not exciting, it's not really much of anything other than a complete waste of time.<br /><br />UGH, I hate this movie.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a selfish hotshot race car who gets lost on his way to an important race and winds up doing some heavy damage to a road in Radiator Springs.

He meets an array of shiny (and rusty) new friends (well, not at first) who teach him some valuable life lessons.<br /><br />The film is shiny, but at the same time it is rather one-note.  The voice acting is effective, not nothing truly noteworthy.  The plot is simple and rather `cookie cutter', and that isn't helped by the lackluster script that layers that characters with clich&eacute; dialog and gags that are almost mind-numbing in their inability to illicit a genuine response from the audience (and by audience I mean ME since I am the only audience that matters in my personal opinion of this film).<br /><br />In a word, this film is just `boring'.",Cars

Owen Wilson's distinctive voice lends great amusement and Paul Newman is terrific. There are moments of genuine humor and great laughs--come on, tractor tipping is classic.<br /><br />Then why, oh why, am I so apathetic about this film? Ultimately, I've just seen this formula before--it's too predictable. Is it still a movie worth seeing? Sure. Might the kids love it? Sure. But it's missing the heart and genuineness of Pixar's earlier works. Oh, it still has all the emotional elements in place--but here they just don't ring true. Never once, after viewing ""Cars,"" did I remember it fondly. It was gone just as soon as I'd seen it. Pleasantly entertaining in the now, ""Cars"" just doesn't have the same enduring appeal as I'd have liked. KGHarris, 11/06.",Cars
809842,B000H7I6CU, AC7J2CCGFQXY9,4.0, Very cute and entertaining movie,"I love Pixar films, they are always poignant, yet funny, not to mention the animation is awesome.  While Cars is not my favorite Pixar movie, it was still entertaining and fun to watch.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen is a flashy and selfish race car on his way to California to race in the big Piston Cup race and while on the highway his ride (a Mack truck called ""Mack""heh) falls asleep and somehow the ramp drops down and lets a sleeping McQueen out onto the highway.  While Mack continues on his way oblivious McQueen is not on board, McQueen suddenly realizes that he can't find his ride and is stuck in the middle of nowhere.<br /><br />He speeds around looking for Mack and unfortunately, gets a police car from a small town of Radiator Springs off route 66, on his tail.  He gets in trouble and ends up having to serve a community service sentence by fixing the road into town that he messed up in his police car chase.  McQueen isn't too happy about this as he's supposed to be in California for the race in a week, but the town leader, Doc Hudson (who presided over his case as judge) is adamant he serve his sentence and McQueen is resigned to his unlucky fate.<br /><br />I thought there were a lot of funny parts in the movie and I found myself laughing out loud at a lot of the scenes.  Instead of ""cow tipping"", there is ""tractor tipping"", and the scene where McQueen and Tow Mater (a rusty tow truck) decide to go tractor tipping was hilarious.  Another funny moment was when the 2 Italian cars that owned the local tire store, and their love of all things Ferrari, finally meet a real life Ferrari (their reactions were so cute!).<br /><br />I loved the message in the movie.  That fame, fortune, and looking out for number one isn't what life is all about, that the love and companionship of friends and family is far more lasting.  It was heart-warming to see the change in the brash Lightning McQueen, as the town of Radiator Springs and its locals, slowly effect his outlook on life.  He begins to realize what is really important vs. what he thought was important before in his flashy race car life.  The ending fit into this theme of what really matters in life, winning no matter what or realizing winning isn't everything (Oh, be sure to continue watching after credits roll, there are scenes after the ending showing what happens after the race).<br /><br />This is a fun-filled movie, with some humorous moments, and while not the best Pixar movie I've seen it was still a good one.  I don't think I've ever seen a bad Pixar movie. =)",Cars

Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way.<br />Lightning McQueen: How do you mean?<br />Sally: Well, the road didn't cut through the land like that interstate. It moved with the land, it rose, it fell, and it curved. Cars didn't drive on it to make great time. They drove on it to have a great time. ""<br /><br />'Route 66, Get Your Kicks on Route 66'- remember that song that solidified the reason for driving to the west on that great highway? As we all knew, the interstates took over and Route 66 is driven only for pleasure, now. Wait a minute, isn't that what driving and vacations are supposed to be?<br /><br />I am usually not an animated film fan, but I think I have been through a conversion, If I wanted to understand my three year old grandaughters fascination with someone called 'Lighting McQueen' I realized I had better get with it. She and I watched this movie, and I fell in love with the story, the animation, the color, the depiction, the soundtrack and the characters. Sally and Lighting' McQueen, Mater, and Doc. Who could better convey life's lessons than these cars in a movie directed towards all of us? Not only is this a knock-out movie but it kept my interest for two hours. My granddaughter told me ""there are some scary parts, gramma, but they go by fast', and she was correct. The Director knows his stuff and the animators and illustrators and the entire kit and caboodle put together a story so well done that this is a must see.<br /><br />he cast of characters could not be better, what voices, what style, they convey the feel of the story with such joie de vive.<br /><br />Owen Wilson .... Lightning McQueen (voice)<br />Paul Newman .... Doc Hudson (voice)<br />Bonnie Hunt .... Sally Carrera (voice)<br />Larry The Cable Guy .... Mater (voice)<br />Cheech Marin ....

Flea Car (voice)<br />Joe Ranft .... Red/Peterbilt (voice)<br />Michael Keaton .... Chick Hicks (voice)<br /><br />The theme of the movie is winning at any cost and life's little diversions that teach us well. Lighting McQueen is the star, but each and every character is integral to the plot and the movie. We all know that we can't have everything, but a little bit is ok!<br /><br />The soundtrack was scored by Randy Newman and it is fabulous. The music lifted me up and I recognized Randy Newman's stamp all over. Rascal Flatts sings the hit ""Life Is a Highway,"" The highlight is Sheryl Crow's ""Real Gone"". John Mayer sings the theme ""Route 66"", and Chuck Berry's version is also included. ""Opening Race,"" and ""Bessie"" does George Thorogood a turn. Randy Newman delivers a wonderful song in"" Our Town,"" sung by James Taylor. The soundtrack is available on CD.<br /><br />The Director, ""Lasseter tells Michele Norris how the idea for the film grew out of a two-month summer trip he took with his family after working nonstop during the 1990s. During that time, he directed the box-office hits A Bug's Life and both Toy Story movies, and served as executive producer for Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo.<br />""I learned that the journey in life is a reward,"" he says. ""It's about living every day to its fullest, and I knew that's what I wanted the film to be about."" Lasseter talks about Cars, the challenges of directing an animated film, and how technological advances have -- and haven't -- affected his work.

809844,B000H7I6CU, A3KKM0T1KY42HA,4.0, No Booster Seats Required For This Car Ride,"Cars is another Disney Pixar success. It succeeds in warming the heart; it makes you appreciate the value of friends and family; and it continues the tradition of teaching good morals. It's a class-A family film.<br /><br />The picture is just awesome; this computer generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.<br /><br />There has been a tremendous proliferation of computer generated films over the past couple of years which has certainly diluted the excitement that used to surround these movies. 2006 has got to set the record with 13...count 'em...13 releases that I can think of (Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, Hoodwinked, The Ant Bully, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away).<br /><br />And perhaps that is why I was a bit tentative going into Cars. Or perhaps it was because I just didn't think a movie about car racing and cars-come-to-life could be as enjoyable as the Disney Pixar films that preceded Cars. I should have known better.<br /><br />Cars is another in Disney Pixar's unblemished track record of delivering the epitome of a wonderful family classic.<br /><br />Here's a little trivia: John Ratzenburger appears (rather, his voice does) in all (Toy Story [1995], A Bug's Life [1998], Toy Story 2 [1999], Monsters, Inc [2001], Finding Nemo [2003], The Incredibles [2004] & Cars [2006]) of the Disney Pixar releases to date, and there's a little tribute to this at the end of Cars during the rolling credits.<br /><br />Cars is a very good movie that's well worth the purchase.",Cars

The pure digital transfer looks beautiful in HiDef with a BluRay player and 1080p HDTV (Sony PS3 and Samsung 40"" in my case).  Colors are spectactular.  I love the music and voice acting Pixar put together as well.  Click and Clack, the Tapert brothers from NPR as the Rusteeze owners was an especially nice touch.  The plot of the film is kid friendly but also takes adults back to the time when people drove cars to drive cars and meet people, not get somewhere.  Now the occasional car meet at the local drive in diner (if any are left in your town) is about all that is left of this culture.  Cars reminds us all of that time not long ago.",Cars
809847,B000H7I6CU, A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,5.0, An Interesting Concept And A Brilliant Movie By Pixar,"Cars was the 7th feature film created by Pixar studios and it kept up the trend of excellent Pixar productions. Managing to win Pixar its 3rd consecutive best Animated Feature Academy award, there was no denying how good this film was. The story is clich&eacute; but the concept is still as fresh as Toy Story was back in the day. Its colourful and detailed environments, cars and sequences are put together brilliantly. Pixar makes its movies with this confidence in their own abilities. They seem to never doubt their animation skills or their general imagination for a unique and awe inspiring story.<br /><br />I mentioned that the story is clich&eacute; so I guess I should explain what I mean when I say that. Most Disney movies tend to be along the same lines with a main character who tends to be quite narrow minded and through a series of enlightening events manages to become open minded and a nice person. There's nothing wrong with that, after all it's good to teach our kids that we should all be open minded and nice people. If that's portrayed by a jealous toy or an overprotective fish then so be it. With that clich&eacute; plot device, Pixar still manages to create a unique film and a brilliantly funny in between to give us a hell of a lot of enjoyment.<br /><br />Cars focuses around stock car race car Lightning McQueen who's a racing champion and a sure fire shot at winning the prestigious Piston Cup. During the final race of the Piston Cup championship, a series of events lead to him and two other cars being tied in a photo finish. Because of this situation it is decided that the three will take part in a one off race to decide the true champion. Whilst being transported by Mack to California, McQueen rolls out the back of the truck while asleep and ends up lost in a small town known as Radiator Springs. McQueen accidentally damages the road in Radiator Springs and is forced by the towns Judge, Doc to stay until he fixes the road. While McQueen is in town he makes friends with a truck named Mater, who isn't the brightest bulb in the street. He also seems to develop a crush on another car known as Sally who's a porsche 911 Carrera.<br /><br />I wont tell you more about the story as it will essentially ruin the movie for you. The whole movie is just amazing and although I was disappointed with their follow up of Ratatouille, Pixar really made me a dedicated fan with this. I would strongly recommend this to any fans of their past movies or just to fans of movies in general as it's just overly entertaining and quite loveable.",Cars

4027638,B001I1NGHY, A2JEONEOLE4FD2,5.0, Ironman proves there are heroes beyond Spidey and Superman,"This is a great entertainer done very well. But how does Ironman compete so well with the Spidey and Superman films that have already established a following?<br />Ans:<br />1. With a great script, catchy dialouges and funny one-liners. You'll get enough of them throughout the movie.<br />2. Great chemistry between co-stars. Particularly between Robert Downey Jr and Gwenyth Paltrow, particularly in the gadget inserting scene, and at the party. The pair is so good they give the Clark Kents-Louis Lanes and Peter Parkers-MJ's a run for their money.<br />3. Decent special effects -This movie doesn't dethrone Spidey and Superman films but you will not be disappointed. The scene showing Ironman breaking the sound barrier on his trip to the village in Afghanistan where he rescues a village from the terrorists was a stroke of a genius. This is something that the Superman movies didn't think of in all these years. The action isn't bad too.<br />3. Many funny scenes - However one of them topped them all. This is the one where Tony is enjoying the wine and trying to look at the stewardesses dancing and at same time trying to pretend he is communicating with his friend who is completely vexed and frustrated trying to get his attention. Earlier in a picture bio, Tony is shown with Bill Gates. That was a nice one too.<br /><br />I wonder why the linguist behind the film made the terrorists speak both Hindi and another language. Jeff Bridges does a good job. Robert Downey Junior makes a great comeback and Gwenyth does a pleasant job as the secretary. Except for one small scene that can be passed off lightly, this movie can be watched by your kids too.<br /><br />Sans Ozzie's vocals, it was great to hear the riffs from Black Sabbath's ""IronMan"" at the end of the movie.<br /><br />If you left the cinema hall during the end-credits, at the end of the end-credits, Samuel L Jackson appears and confronts Tony Stark indicating to us that a sequel is in the making. Not to forget Tony's entry in the last minutes in ""Incredible Hulk"" movie. Something's brewing there too. I am sure we can expect more from him.",Iron Man

I got the Hulk on a rental for the above listed reasons, and quite liked it as well, and was happy I watched it first, to get the tie in of Tony Stark industries...<br /><br />In any case I watched it by myself first because my wife is really not a ""Comic Book GUY"" but I thought it was so good I asked her to watch it, and surprisingly she enjoyed it as well. So why does a comic book work as a movie? It is an interesting story about a life changing epiphany, and how the things you want, may not be the ones you need or love. It is an interesting story about the futility of bargaining with evil. And how any evil thing we do may come back to bite us in the backside, no matter the motives.<br /><br />Also...

George Lucas did it with his Star Wars prequels and the producers of Iron Man chose to do it the same way too.  The movie is a combination of a good script (many times side-lined in such movies) and very good special effects.  Robert Downey proved he is a good actor in this movie by getting in the right shape required and as usuall living the role.

I knew, from reading other Marvel comics back in the day, who he was and a little of his origins. I also knew he was an alcoholic, so I couldn't help but snicker when I found out Robert Downey Jr was picked to play Tony Stark. ""How perfect,"" I thought. ""Bound not to be much of a stretch for him.""<br /><br />Thankfully, he turned out to be far, far better in the role than I had expected! He really owns every single seen he's in, and brings a real sense of confidence and ease to the picture.<br /><br />You know the plot by now: Tony Stark, billionaire weapons designer, is captured by terrorists while on a visit to a place suspiciously similar to Afghanistan. They try to force him to build a new weapon for them, and instead he builds it for himself, emerging in a suit of armor and becoming Iron Man.<br /><br />It's a simple plot, but it works very well. The film succeeds on several levels due largely to the good writing, excellent pacing and wonderful action. But what really brings it home is the great acting on the part of Downey, Jeff Bridges and Gweneth Paltrow. They make this film what it is.<br /><br />There's really not much else to say here. It's an entertaining, well-done popcorn flick. Not a perfect movie, but certainly a stunning example of what the genre can do and easily the second best super hero film of 2008.",Iron Man
4027658,B001I1NGHY, ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,5.0, It's time...,"To consider Comic Book character Movies as a serious genre.  I know some people think there are a lot of them out there and might be getting sick of them...but you have to face it, they are a great source of material.  And they are getting better as a whole.<br /><br />With the release of three superhero movies this summer (Iron Man, Hulk, The Dark Knight), you would think one of them really stunk.  Not so.  And with the release of Watchmen next year, I gaurentee many people will see a much different side of comic book heroes then they have before.  But I digress.  Let's talk Iron Man.<br /><br />Iron Man is an iconic character in the Marvel universe.  Everyone knows his name, partially thanks to Black Sabbath.  But bringing him to the screen could have been really tricky.  Especially when you announce Robert Downey Jr. is going to play Tony Stark, the ambitious, brilliant and self centered billionaire industrialist who becomes the title character.  Downey might seem, to fans, too smarmy for the role.  But thankfully he is a great fan of the character himself and choose not to make any great changes.  For the most part, he plays Stark brilliantly, but adds his own touch as well.  In the comics, Stark is a brilliant playboy, with very little sense of humor.  As for Downey's version, he brings wit and a sense of being aloof.  It's just what the character needed.<br /><br />Plot wise, it's simple.  Stark is captured and forced to build a missile for a terrorist group.  He rebels in his own way; he builds a suit of armor from the pieces in order to escape.  Since he realizes the weapons his company makes are being stolen by or sold to the enemies, he announces a halt on all weapon producing industry.  He starts working on his own project of creating a suit of armor based around his heart supporting energy source.  At first, he just wants to fly.  But then incorporates weapons to take out the terrorist group.<br /><br />Director Jon Favareau deserves a lot of credit for balancing the serious with the brilliant with the humorist on this one.  Iron Man is one of the best Superhero movies ever to be made and Downey makes Stark his most entertaining character to date.",Iron Man

How can he correct his faux pax?<br /><br />In his quest for the answers he solicits the help of his very efficient and devoted assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow.)<br /><br />For those enthralled in the Ironman comics, nothing has changed; except maybe the storyline. O.K the era in which how superhero exists. Well maybe a tad more gratuities sex. O.K. I guess I could go on for a few more paragraphs but you get the picture that we can not rely on the comic book character to be anymore than an inspiration for this movie.<br /><br />For people that are more music orientated, among the popular background songs they included the original theme from the animated series.<br /><br />It has all the formula and characters for today's super hero movies. By not making it a period piece we get to incorporate all the latest technology and social attitudes.<br /><br />Only saw the Blu-Ray version. Had the standard extras and flexibility.

Stark is assisted in the task by the ill-fated captive Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub). The plot then takes a roller-coaster ride of betrayal, redemption and avenging the death of his fellow captive, while building up to something called the ""Avenger Initiative"".<br /><br />This character may become a surprising franchise in the crowded marketplace of super heroes in the contemporary settings of war and politics. The 2-disc Blu-ray edition is an outstanding way to start on the adventure or to see it again....for the very first time.",Iron Man
4027663,B001I1NGHY, A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,4.0," Great Entertainment, Good Story, Fascinating Techie Stuff","I've heard both good and not so great comments about Iron Man. Let me toss in mine. Tony Stark is a Mcgyverish, haunted James Bond. If you can picture that blend, great, if not, think highly intelligent and handy with whatever is lying around playboy who has a bit of a heart change after facing death and barely cheating it.<br /><br />From a female point of view, the machines, effects and equipment were cool and not overly technical to the point I lost interest. Techie geeks may have issues with the details, so read a techie focused review if you fit that category. The film clipped along at a fast, tense pace. Plenty of humor, a little love, sarcasm and some skin are tossed in.<br /><br />The language is pretty clean. I either missed some or was caught up enough into the story that it didn't grate against my ears. Downey plays an anti/super-hero like he was born to play it. The film felt comic booky with sharp visuals and colors, and should appeal to the lovers of the comic book films. Bridges gets kudos for his portrayal, as well.<br /><br />Sensitive parents may want to take note of the playboy Stark who has a quick, not too subtle romp with a female reporter. Iron Man is not as squeaky clean as the traditional superhero films (think Peter Parker). Violence isn't gory as much as shoot-em-up. Kids in danger might be frightening for some children and a scene in the car with soldiers is sad and might bother some who have soldiers currently serving.",Iron Man
4027664,B001I1NGHY, A1Z8P36SJUOEJQ,5.0, Tony Stark Rocks the Planet,"Okay, let me just say, that this is the best Marvel Adaptation I have seen since Spiderman 2, and to have it immediately followed by the new Hulk movie just about made this the best year for superhero movies.  And the very thought of those two characters, Iron Man and the Hulk, crossing over, is sooooooooo exciting I can barely contain myself.<br /><br />Now for the nitty-gritty:  Some people, including myself, have questioned the choice of Robert Downey Jr playing Stark.  When I saw, ages ago, that he would be the title character, I was kind of surprised.  Downey, it seems to me, has been flying low under the radar lately.  With Iron Man he explodes onto the scene, and, as far as I can see, blows the skeptics away.<br /><br />Gwyneth as Pepper Potts? A surprise, I never expect to see her in supporting roles, but in this one she looked good.  (and, as an aside, at a healthier weight than I think I have ever seen)<br /><br />Jeff Bridges:  Most Excellent, per usual, but if you have a pet peeve with word pronounciation you won't like his treatment of 'manufactured'.<br /><br />Like I said, definitely the best superhero movie from Marvel that I have seen in a long time.  And The Incredible Hulk is an impressive companion, so I hope when it comes out on DVD they sell them in sets!!<br /><br />I highly reccommend it, it's definitely worth the price of a movie ticket or rental fee and even purchasing the DVD.",Iron Man

The turning point was when my own father (who's around 60) went to the film and liked it! I then said, ""I've got to see this one now!""<br /><br />I am glad I did! While it isn't an Oscar winner, it is definitely for action lovers and comic fans! Robert Downey, Jr. definitely had Tony Stark down cold! A selfish industrialist who is forced to change his ways and outlook on life after an attack leaves his body shattered and forces him to create the machine that would become his ""costume"" for justice as Iron Man.<br /><br />Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow do a great job as their respective characters.

4027667,B001I1NGHY, A2PBV1899CX3TE,4.0," Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing","Iron Man works on many levels--as an action movie with lots of explosions, fights, and great special effects--but also a sophisticated comedy poking fun at the genre--or finally a character driven drama that explores complex and conflicted characters. Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect choice to play bad boy/genius/arms merchant Tony Stark. He could almost be playing himself, except for the arms merchant part. It is great to see Robert Downey Jr. clean and sober after his well publicized bout with drugs. But his checkered past gives him just the edge to play the jaded Stark:<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: [walking in on Stark's robots trying to get him out of the Iron Man suit] What is going on here?<br />Tony Stark: Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.<br />Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: Are those bullet holes?<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />According to an interview, Downey got off the drugs after an epiphany involving a cheeseburger from Burger King. An interesting parallel developed in Iron Man where Tony Stark was captured in a foreign land, then when he escaped and got back on US soil, the first thing he craved was a cheeseburger. Product placement? Perhaps, but what could be more American? Someone said after Elvis died that it was as if there would suddenly be no more cheeseburgers. Of course, Tony Stark and Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) also love pizza from New York. One more thing, there is a really clever reference to the game 'Operation' a generational touchstone familiar to those of Stark's generation, but one that went right over the heads of the young Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow).<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. did a lot of ad libs, and his quick quips and clever comebacks added quite a lot to Iron Man:<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Christine Everheart: Mr. Stark! Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?<br />Hogan: [whispers to Stark] She's cute.<br />Tony Stark: [whispers to Hogan] She's alright?<br />[turns around]<br />Tony Stark: Hi!<br />Christine Everheart: Hi.<br />Tony Stark: Yeah. Okay, go.<br />Christine Everheart: You've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?<br />Tony Stark: Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.<br />Christine Everheart: And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?<br />Tony Stark: That's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?<br />Christine Everheart: Brown, actually.<br />Tony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.<br />Christine Everheart: Rehearse that much?<br />Tony Stark: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.<br />Christine Everheart: I can see that.<br />Tony Stark: I'd like to show you firsthand.<br />=================================================<br /><br />Jon Favreau did a great job of directing. Like I said, it works on many levels, much to his credit. He's come a long way since 'Swingers' but I noticed right away his obvious talent. He proved he could do a movie with a small budget, but Wow, look what he can do with a huge budget! This film reminds me a little bit of Transformers, what with the special effects and giant robotic battles, but that film also had compelling human characters to give meaning to all the sound and fury. The teenage traumas and dramas of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) made it all signify something, which was quite a feat, considering it was a movie based on toys. 'Iron Man,' thanks to clever direction by Favreau and the personality of Downey Jr. managed a similar feat. In the tsunami of Super Hero/comic book blockbusters, it really stands out. Favreau really 'got it' that as much as machines and technology fascinate us, it is still the human element that finally connects. In 'Iron Man' there are plenty of examples of machines becoming more human--and vice versa. The whole Tony Stark with a mechanical heart, and then when he puts on the Iron Man suit? Or how about the other way around, when he talks to his machines as if they were people? There is a robotic arm that follows him around, eager to do his bidding. When he chastises it for being over zealous, it droops in despair that is so human and familiar.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, that reminds me. When Tony Stark is working with his machines and computers he is listening to ""Institutionalized"" by Suicidal Tendencies. Pepper Potts comes in and turns it down and he yells at her as if she were his mom. There is some cool music in 'Iron Man' but you keep waiting to hear the Black Sabbath tunage of the same name. Finally, as the credits roll, we get to hear that fabulous riff. Though just an instrumental version, it sounds fresh and I wondered if it was rerecorded for the film. Whether it is a new or old version, according to the credits, it is performed by Black Sabbath. After holding back and teasing us with it, Jon Favreau finally lets us hear it, and it sounds great.<br /><br />Jon Favreau ...

I have been reading Marvel comics for as long as I remember and have basically experienced the rise and fall of their illustrious movie career. I lost faith after Spidey 3 and Ghost Rider and when I heard Iron Man was coming out I nearly hung myself. I watched it last night and I nearly cried for Marvel has redeemed itself finally. The movie was awesome, the dialog was snappy and the fact that they did not concentrate on the armor was excellent also. And when they mentioned S.H.I.E.L.D at the end, I jumped for joy because Marvel finally incorporated another part of their universe into one of their movies. Now my faith in Marvel has been restored and you know what, I started collecting and reading comic books again. I feel the fan boy coming back and I love it. I hope they don't massacre the sequel and I pray they don't massacre the Avengers, Thor and the Punisher War Zone. FANBOYS UNITE!!!!",Iron Man

4027672,B001I1NGHY, AGKPTMTR3UX1R,4.0," ""I need a scotch. I'm starving.""","Robert Downey Jr. doesn't strike the average viewer as superhero material, which is probably why IRON MAN works so magnificently. Based on the Marvel Comics series about industrialist Tony Stark who builds a metallic suit chock full of high-tech gadgetry and dedicates his life to saving the world, IRON MAN is a witty and intelligent action film.<br /><br />Downey is near perfect playing the multibillionaire Stark. One minute he is the Playboy of The Western World a la James Bond. The next minute he rivals Al Pacino's Tony Montana of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AMRJC"">Scarface</a> for crassness. He is a workaholic, a hedonist, and an eccentric loner, whose only close relationship is with his secretary, Pepper Potts, played here by Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />Beautiful yes, but more so translucently lovely, Ms. Paltrow has an inborn grace that softly overwhelms the viewer. To date, this reviewer has seen that quality of elegance onscreen only in actress Natalie Portman and in Ms. Paltrow's own mother, Blythe Danner. Paltrow's competent but feminine Pepper therefore, is the perfect counterpoint to Downey's brash Iron Man.<br /><br />In this version, Stark is wounded by terrorists. Escaping, he takes on the Iron Man persona and returns to wreak vengeance. Unfortunately, the terrorists are being aided by a business rival of Stark Industries, who builds a similar suit and engages Iron Man in a battle for New York City.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a cut above most Superhero films, a real Summer Movie. Marvel is constantly perfecting their cinematic craft.",Iron Man
4027673,B001I1NGHY, AOTMP0OKJOUWI,5.0, Warnin,"Yes, I am one of those irritating people who have never read the comic (sorry, but I am simply not a comic reader--more so because I never had the opportunity to become addicted) and had barely heard of Iron Man until I saw the trailor for this very movie back in the day.<br /><br />So... my review will be based simply on my impressions of the movie with no reference to Marvel or comic anything else.  Because I don't know any of that.<br /><br />To begin, this is a fantastic movie.  I don't know enough about movie making to disect the details, but I like to think I can avoid the truly terrible and I do know what I like.  So in my humble opinion this is a truly wonderful movie, having everything I think a truly wonderful movie needs:  good plot, decent effects, great acting, and lots of heart.  Yes, I was honestly touched by this movie.<br /><br />And that is because what truly got me was the theme.  I'm not a fan of war (I don't think anyone truly is) and there was something about the whole fight-for-peace thing that got to me--and this is doubled by the change of heart for lead character Tony Stark.  Sue me, I'm a sucker for that sort of thing.<br /><br />So this theme leads into a delightfully action-y storyline that is simple enough to carry itself through without being brain-killing.  The cast is SUPERB. I can't think of anyone else I could get to play a part in this assortment of characters.  And these characters?  A great blend of humanity mixed with a definite ""fun"" feel.  Wonderful combination.<br /><br />And I can't get over how the screen sizzles when Downey and Paltrow have a scene together. And they never even kiss. That is a testament against all those that think rampant sex is the only way to show passion on the silver screen.<br /><br />Apparently this movie was enough to please someone who does not read comics.  It has the action, romance, and heart to make a quality movie.",Iron Man

4027675,B001I1NGHY, A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,5.0, A Triumphant Blend of Action and Character.,"""Iron Man"" is one of the best comic book adaptations to find its way to the big screen. With sharper dialogue than ""Spiderman"" 1 and 2 and more irreverent energy than Tim Burton's ""Batman"" films, which would be its only competition, this is pure fun and a great start to a superhero franchise. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a self-absorbed playboy industrialist and wunderkind of the arms industry. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile, he is kidnapped by a militant faction who insist that he build them one of his new-fangled weapons. Assisted by the Afghani doctor (Shaun Toub) who saved his life, Stark constructs a bullet-proof, firethrowing, flying suit of armor to use in his escape instead. Upon returning to the United States, Stark finds that his priorities have changed. He plans to take Stark Industries in the direction of energy technologies, not weapons, which doesn't sit well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />As the first film in the franchise, ""Iron Man"" spends a lot of time on Stark's transformation. I never felt like the story was filler in between a bunch of overblown action sequences. The action never lasts very long. This is a good thing. It pushes the pace of the film while avoiding prolonged duels that can become tedious. I think it would be generous to call director Jon Favreau's previous work ""mediocre"", but I have to admit that ""Iron Man"" is a triumph. Favreau even successfully dealt with the challenge of making it interesting to watch someone build a machine or look at a computer screen. The key is that Stark is able to converse with his computer and make pithy comments to his robot while working. Not every actor would have been so amusing talking to himself, but Robert Downey, Jr. makes Tony Stark a lovable reformed rake. The film's only weakness is that Stark's leggy personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his military liaison Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) seem to be there only for decoration.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): The only bonus features on the single disc edition are 11 deleted or extended scenes and a publicity spot (1 min) for the upcoming Iron Man animated series. Plus there is a short but sweet Easter Egg (2 min) in which ""Iron Man"" co-creator Stan Lee talks about Robert Downey Jr. and his cameo appearance in the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish,  French. Dubbing available in French and Spanish.",Iron Man

Though friends who do read the comic say it's close enough.<br /><br />With all that, in my opinion, this movie was a great super hero movie. I really loved the two new Batman movies but have heard some people argue that Begins was a little slow. And while I can see what they're talking about, it didn't seem boring to me.<br /><br />Meaning: I like that they're doing these origin movies. Iron man could have been a flop but it wasn't. I looked at my watch afterwards and thought, holy crap, that was 2 hours!? There was absolutely no chance to be bored in this film.<br /><br />The movie grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. I had my doubts about Downey Jr pulling off the role. And let's be honest, it was Robert Downey Jr. being Robert Downey Jr. It was a perfect role for him. He made the character believable.<br /><br />That I didn't realize time had passed is the best compliment I can give this movie. Unlike the Matthew Broderick Godzilla a few years back where I looked at my watch and realized it had only been twenty minutes into my suffering.<br /><br />My copy of the DVD is on it's way to me so I can't attest to the special features.

While I enjoyed Spiderman, I am just not sure who decides which villains to place in movies these days.  That is my only fear for Iron Man 2 (which I am sure is coming).  However, the first one, without a major super-villain was A BLAST.  WHY?  Becasue it actually told a story and didn't get caught up in trying to create an adversary for the hero...it actually focused on the hero.  What  novel concept!

I mean people were skeptical because Robert Downey Jr. hadnt been in a lead role for a decade so it was questioned if he would fare well or not. After seeing this movie , we all can agree that Robert Downey Jr not only was perfect for the role of Tony Starks, he also gave the man personality.<br /><br />Brief spoilers: Tony Starks gets into a near fatal accident in a Middle Eastern country and is forced to build a weapon for some millitia group there. He builds his first Iron Man suit(which looks like the Iron Giant) and escapes from the terrorist group's clutches. He is found lying in the desert and returns home to say that he is through making weapons comes as a shock to everybody. Meanwhile there is something fishy going on with his longtime partner Obadiah Stane(Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />Opinion: Robert Downey Jr is great as Tony Starks. Gwyneth Paltrow is perfect as his assistant Pepper Potts and even though I had Michael Jai White in mind as Rhodes, Terrence Howard does just fine as the Colonel. Jeff Bridges is in top form as Obadiah Stane. I like how they took time to show how Tony Starks tested his armor out before he decided to finally use it. I also like the fact that the movie sticks to the comic book without being cartoonish and silly.

But he prooved everyone why he was perfect for the role.<br /><br />This is on my list of the 5 best superhero movies of all time which includes Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Incredible Hulk and Blade.<br /><br />I bought the 2 disc edition at Target which came in a different package. You get the box but the dvds itself come in a cool case that is shaped and looks like Iron Man's mask. Its the same price as this edition with the same special features but the only difference is the case.<br /><br />The dvd is loaded with special features that include:<br /><br />Deleted and Extended scenes (comes with the 1 disc edition as well but thats what it only has)<br />Behind the scenes<br />Still Galaries<br />and so much more<br /><br />This dvd is perfect for any fan of comics, especially of Iron Man, or if you just love super hero movies or just a fan of movies with tons of action and special effects. This dvd is perfect for anyone.",Iron Man

4027684,B001I1NGHY, A148VBRPM5AMSB,5.0, It's Everything Iron Man Should Be,"Some Summer movie fans thought that this film wouldn't come close to being a blockbuster like The Dark Knight.Well let me say that The Dark Knight was a confusing mess and this time DC Comics really dropped the ball.Iron Man was very well done.It stayed true to the origin story of why Tony Stark became Iron Man somewhat.In the comics he escaped out of Vietnam as a POW,in this adaptation it was in the Middle East. But that's a good thing because this film is set in the present time and it all makes sense in our world today. It is also a commentary that a man can change his ways and make a difference in the world. Faverau really avoided the fact that Tony was an alcoholic and was a greedy prick in most cases.The director did show Tony partying alot and drinking here and there.Iron Man is a great companion film to Incredible Hulk.It is best to watch Iron Man first and then Hulk because at the end of The Hulk Tony shows up and makes a comment eluding to the Avengers.In one scene you can see Captain America's shield in Tony's workshop.Jeff Bridges is in great shape for his age and plays the ultimate villain,a backstabber! Marvel is giving DC it's money's worth and is bringing the heat.Just a side comment if I may,but late 2008 and 2009's flicks are going to be awesome. Here's the lineup so far.Punisher:War Zone,Watchmen,GIJOE,Transformers 2:Revenge Of The Fallen,Wolverine,Terminator:Salvation and Superman:Man Of Steel.Marvel and DC have been at it for years over the summer box office.And that's okay because the fans are the real winners.So when you get Iron Man make sure you pre-order Hulk.And if your'e a comics nut like I am,you should get Dark Knight just for the hell of it,just because you'll be owning Heath Ledger's last complete role on film.",Iron Man
4027685,B001I1NGHY, ALLVXWH9HCW2X,5.0, Iron Man is simply an outstanding movie on every level,"It's no wonder that everyone is praising Iron Man in some way. For me, Iron Man is the best origin movie ever made. It surpasses every original installment of any superhero film to date. It doesn't just manage to deliver a little bit of everything but it does it with style and integrity. Iron Man is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The mega talented cast fit each main character perfectly and the story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. The dialogue is witty and what humor there is works its way seamlessly in to the natural order of the story. (No forced bachelor party dancing to set up a joke etc.) A couple of comic book style slugfests are included but inserted only as a vehicle for the story. Things aren't blown up just for the sake of seeing them go boom. What makes Iron Man a true rarity is that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult. How many movies can you say that about? This is truly moviemaking of the most entertaining order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike.",Iron Man
4027686,B001I1NGHY, A7Y6AVS576M03,5.0, IRON MAN went way Beyond my Expectations,IRON MAN went way beyond my expectations. I was blown away. Robert Downey Jr. is incredible. He seems to get better with each film he makes. He makes Iron Man and true to life hero despite the implausibility of it all. He literally gives this character heart (no pun intended). IRON MAN is a thoroughly entertaining film thanks to a great script and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. I like the way the film makers updated the setting and integrated the origin of Iron Man into the current socio-political situation in the Middle East. I was totally surprised how good this film was. This is one you just have to see. It entertains but works on such an emotional level and  that's what really makes it work.,Iron Man
4027687,B001I1NGHY, A2KW2KWKABNYNO,5.0, The Best Superhero Movie So Far...,"I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.<br /><br />The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.<br /><br />The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.<br /><br />The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.<br /><br />Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.<br /><br />Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.<br /><br />Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.<br /><br />Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. This will certainly be a movie I pick up when it comes out on Blu-Ray later this year. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!",Iron Man

After Daredevil,(awful) The Hulk bomb, Fantastic Four...eh, at least we got to see Jessica Alba, and even the last Spiderman came up really short, this was a very welcome surprise.  Robert Downey Jr. is excellent, as is Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow.  The story is very well executed. (Having never read Iron Man in my days of youth, I didn't have to waste 2 hours making sure the screenplay was exactly like the old comic.)  I imagine the film could have been longer in order to add more dimension and back story, but this delivered the goods, and I look forward to the sequel.  5 stars!",Iron Man
4027689,B001I1NGHY, A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,5.0," The New ""Golden Avenger"" Standard for Superhero Films","I saw this at a local theater with my co-worker friend on a very rainy day while on a two and a half hour lunch from work (ok, we played hooky).  It was the first show of the first day that this film was released.  I think there were about 30 people in the theater.  I had to wait 2 weeks to let my ""giddies"" subside enough so that I could write a somewhat coherent review.  I've gotten in the habit of writing in little, categorized chapters.  Here goes;<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!!.....<br />  Sorry about that.  I promised myself I would never do that.  I can't seem to help myself.  This might be the most excited I have ever been about a movie since seeing ""Star Wars"" nearly 32 years ago.  Not even ""Lord of the Rings"" got me this stoked (and I love that series).  I read an interview with Director, Jon Favreau in the Detroit Free Press.  He described his initial meeting with ILM at their facilities.  In a conference room full of ILM staff and notables he uttered these words; ""I hate CGI"".  As you would guess they were quite stunned.  It's because of this attitude that Favreau is quickly becoming my favorite Hollywood Director ( ""Zathura"" was also surprisingly good).  His belief in using practical effects whenever possible is leading to more realistic and believable films than most of his peers.  Of course, his desire to see really cool and smart movies (like most people) does not hurt.  He really has faith in his audience and it pays off tremendously.<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!<br />  Pardon me!!  MAN, 0 for 2!  I'm being completely honest when I say this; by the time Stark invents his first ""Iron"" suit to break out of his prison, this had already become my favorite live action superhero movie.  That was roughly half way through.  The film could have ended there and I would have been completely satisfied.  But wait, there is so much more.  We spend the next 3rd of the film watching him transform technically and personally, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  We get to laugh at his failures and impulsive behavior, and it is a joy.  But wait, there is more.  He starts to save the world, one person at a time and it is spectacular and... ...it is a joy.  But wait!!  Well, you get the picture.  By the time the final climactic battle comes around, you might think it was unnecessary; however, it is a joy<br /><br />THIS FILM ROCKS!!!<br />OK!!  Now it's just getting annoying!!  Despite the great visual FX and the outstanding action and nearly perfect story, it is the characters that make this film.  I have never been a huge fan of any of the actors in this film.  I thought they were ok but never was too wowed.  Now, I am having a serious case of man-love for Robert Downey Jr.. I thought his casting as Tony Stark was a good idea before seeing the film.  Now I'm convinced it was pure genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow's secondary role as Pepper Potts (assistant savant) actually stood out.  She brought a huge amount of depth and realism to a fringe character; impressive.  The rest of the characters/actors were equally believable and performed above my expectations.  Again, I think this speaks of masterful direction.<br /><br />THIS FILM RO....<br />That's enough!!  This is the first solo film production from Marvel Entertainment.  HUGE KUDOS!!  They obviously know their core product much better than the Hollywood regulars.  They recently announced their plans through 2011.  In the next few years we will get to see a new and hopefully better Hulk, Captain America, Mighty Thor, more Iron Man and Nick Fury; Agent of SHEILD.  All of these films will be connected in some way and seem to be pointing at a culmination in an ""Avengers"" film.  If Marvel keep their focus and stick to what worked so brilliantly in ""Iron Man"" we are all in for a real treat!!<br /><br />A WORD TO PARENTS<br />There is one sex scene in this film.  It's a bit rough (physically speaking). Though no real nudity occurs it might be more than you'd like your kids to see.  Some of the violence could be too intense for younger or sensitive kids<br /><br />Did I mention that THIS FILM ROCKS!?!?!?  Just checking.",Iron Man
4027690,B001I1NGHY, A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,4.0, Completely Stunned That I Liked the Movie,"If not for my mother being hell bent on seeing this movie on Mother's Day, I probably would've never seen it. I'm not big on superheroes, fighting crime, and action movies (unless it involves speeding cars), but I sat through this movie patiently to please my mother. However, somewhere along the line, it stopped being about my mother, and the movie grabbed my interest. This movie took an interesting spin in an updated way by making the plot about a weapon's expert who originally made products to fight against terrorists, but when he was captured as a war prisoner and forced to make weapons for the terrorists, the expert had to figure out how to escape. His escaping escapade led him to perfect the Iron Man suit (full of humorous scenes) and find out that back in America, there were some sneaky issues going on with his business and personal life around him. I enjoyed the sarcastic comments and dry wit of the Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man character, and of course, Terrence Howard's character was as smooth and charismatic as Howard is in every movie. The very beginning was interesting, then the next 20 minutes were slow, and the movie picked up after that and took off.

A few scenes in the beginning had me worried, because they had some weird jumping camera effects, but most of the movie's style is slick and smooth.<br />*Very good, sleek production designs and costumes.<br />*Pretty good, straightforward story.  Contains a good mix of action, comedy, drama, and a smidgeon of romance.<br />*Good themes and imagery reflecting modern-day conflicts in the world, and the role major business play in it (a little similar to ""Lord of War"", but not as serious).<br />*Pretty good characters; pretty good acting.  In fact, the main character is better developed than I thought he would be.  Much of the story revolves around his evolution from a cold-hearted entrepeneur into an empathetic hero.<br />*Look out for Stan Lee's cameo, once again!<br />*Great sound effects.<br />*Awesome music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*One or two slow parts.  The really cool stuff doesn't happen until at least 30 minutes into it.  But it's still not too dull at all.<br /><br />Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie.  Much of the action and effects are quite memorable.  The characters are not too shabby.  The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening.  Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing), I would say that it is better.  It's still not extremely deep or profound, but is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than ""The Fantastic Four.""",Iron Man
4027692,B001I1NGHY, A18ERYDQU2AHQ0,5.0, The best comic book superhero movie adaptation to date.,"Okay, you've heard tons of reviews about how awesome the movie is.  Its like a Disneyland ride, you see it the first time and its exciting- but you want to go back to see it again, because you know you missed some stuff.  My husband and I have already been back to see the movie a second time- and yes, we will be going to see it again the theaters.  But if you are into the comics, then you wanna know how close this is to the comic book. And let me tell you, being that this is a Marvel produced movie (instead of studio produced) they took care of their baby.  Some time ago they updated the Iron Man comic from the 60's version, of Iron Man being in Vietnam, to the Middle East.  The movie further adapts it to fit the current goings on in the world.  This detail doesn't take away from the story at all.  In fact, the movie is so close to the comic book, that its obvious the care Marvel took in keeping true to Iron Man and Tony Stark.  The only problem we found was in the Jarvis representation, but it didn't take away from the story either.  There was still the playful interaction some readers come to love between Tony and Jarvis.  The 10 rings is addressed, but not fully fleshed out.  But that's what Iron Man 2 is for; seeing as this was Iron Man, and Tony Stark's introduction to the movie fan.  Favreau did an excellent job weaving this story, and making it understandable, even if you aren't into the comics- without making the comic book read feel as if the story is being dumbed down.  Its not, not at all!  He is a brilliant director, and did a fantastic job.  Robert Downey Jr is excellent as Iron Man/Tony Stark- he really IS Tony Stark and its so excellent, he's funny, and charming.. which makes it obvious exactly why Tony Stark is the ladies man he is; he was born to play this role, and Terrence Howard will be FANTASTIC as War Machine in the next film!  I hope to see Happy and Pepper together in the next film, and I hope that Tony's alcoholism plays a bigger part in the next film, as its been something he struggled with during the comics.  But this is all stuff you wouldn't expect to be overwhelmed with in the first movie, but want to see in the second film.  There is not a single boring moment.  The movie is fast paced, and takes you on an excellent ride.  The after credit scene had me howling, and will probably have every Marvel fan howling as well- so make sure you stick around for it.",Iron Man

Indeed, it is quite simply the best cinematic adaptation of a comic book character I have seen so far. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of his best screen performances as billionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark, whose near-fatal encounter with Afghani terrorists literally leads him towards a new path in life. The supporting cast is just as superb, most notably Gwyneth Paltrow as Stark's lovely - and brilliant - assistant Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges as Stark's complicated business partner Obediah Stane. Director Jon Favreau does a fine job handling both the intense, often bloody, action sequences and the more introspective scenes featuring Downey and Paltrow.

This is the role that Downey Jr. was born to play!  The movie is not only good it is one of the best action films to come out in years!  Everybody cast was perfect from Terrance Howard as Tony Stark's military friend, to Gwyneth Paltrow as a very sexy version of Pepper Potts (Stark's fawning and overprotective Administrative Assistant).<br /><br />Stark is a wild playboy genius who reminds me of the Mozart character in Amadeus.  After being almost killed by a mine explosion from one of his own company's weapons, Stark becomes a changed man who is more interested in saving the world than creating weapons.  Unfortunately his evil partner and mentor, Obadiah Stane has other ideas.<br /><br />The action is great and Iron Man's suit is very believable.

It was a bit violent for me, but the story is excellent with lots of plot twists. The pacing was very good. The special effects for the most part were fabulous and did not take over the plot.

4027697,B001I1NGHY, A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,5.0, A True Blockbuster,"With a meteoric rise from first-time film making Marvel Enterprises, we get to see an action-packed, funny, and eye-popping movie with a perfect cast and an even more perfect script.<br /><br />To start with, IRON MAN needed a great lead character. Tony Stark is known to be cocky, good-looking, and an all-around bad-boy. So who better to inhabit this persona than Robert Downey Jr. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1NXJ0"">Good Night, and Good Luck</a>). I think most people know Downey Jr.'s difficulties and run-ins with the law over the past several years, and I could think of no one better to pull off this character than someone who has some of those very same flaws.<br /><br />You also need a good villain, and Obadiah Stane was the perfect stab-in-the-back. Played very well by the surprising Jeff Bridges (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KB4898"">Tideland</a>), I found myself repulsed by his money-mongering ways that Tony (Downey Jr.) wants so badly to be rid of after considering (and witnessing) the human cost.<br /><br />We get a bit of romantic/sexual tension, too, in the form of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNM3"">Proof</a>), Tony Stark's life secretary. The drop-dead gorgeous dress that Potts wears to a dance and the subsequent almost-kiss make for some of the best tightly wound scenes between a man and woman within a comic-book-to-film venture.<br /><br />Another huge plus for the film is the amazing CGI. Never once will the audience believe they aren't watching real life. This is, in part, thanks to Downey Jr.'s incorporation into these scenes as he tries and often fails to get his Iron Man suit off the ground. It's also hilarious to watch Tony Stark admonish his robotic gadgets as they try to help him but, more often than not, hurt him in some way (by spraying him with a fire extinguisher, for example, even though there's no fire).<br /><br />I also really enjoyed the perfectly timed dialogue:<br /><br />Stark: ""Okay, seriously, I feel like you're driving me to court martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're gonna pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forest...""<br /><br />Jimmy: ""We can talk, sir.""<br /><br />Stark: ""Oh, I see. So it's personal. Alright.""<br /><br />Ramirez: ""You intimidate them, sir.""<br /><br />Stark: ""Good god, you're a woman! I honestly couldn't have called that. I mean, I would apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.""<br /><br />Ramirez: ""I'm an airman.""<br /><br />Stark: ""Well you actually have excellent bone structure there. I'm having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?""<br /><br />This kind of snappy dialogue is sprinkled throughout the film and keeps the viewer laughing and interested the entire length of the movie.<br /><br />Plenty of times movie-goers have seen films with a lot of action and no substance, but Iron Man happily -- and easily -- gives us both. It's well-deserving of the title ""blockbuster."" And if you really want to see what lay ahead for Iron Man, please stay til after the credits have finished rolling. You'll be exceptionally pleased if you do.",Iron Man
4027698,B001I1NGHY, A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,5.0, The comic superhero movie I've been waiting for!,"There will probably never be a ""superhero"" movie that will stand the test-of-time as a full-blown movie CLASSIC.  Could there every be a CITIZEN KANE of some guy in a brightly colored costume flying around saving people?  Probably  not.<br /><br />But as POPULAR entertainment, some superhero movies offer more pure entertainment snap and sizzle and fun than others.  SPIDERMAN 2 overcame the silliness of the comic-book genre with some genuinely exciting and eye-popping action sequences.  BATMAN BEGINS created a visual feast of a world, and populated it with actors full of gravitas.  Even HELLBOY won out by bringing a tongue-in-cheek attitude to the whole thing.  But for me (and I'm NOT a real ""fan-boy""), IRON MAN is the most well-rounded effort in this genre that I've yet seen.  The highest complement I can think to pay is that when I left the theater, I was ready to see more IRON MAN movies right away.  I  was so thoroughly enjoying myself that I wasn't ready to leave yet.<br /><br />This is due in HUGE part to the splendid performance from Robert Downey Jr.  Certainly the least likely superhero casting since Michael Keaton donned Batman's tight garb...but also perhaps the most inspired.  Downey is convincing as Tony Stark, the brilliant, hedonistic and fabulously wealthy arms manufacturer.  Stark pops with Downey's trademark under his breath, quickly mumbled jabs and bursts of wit.  He's on edge, always on the go.  We can see that his mind is moving a mile a minute...juggling a dozen things at once.  Downey's intelligence is palpable...and so is his devil-may-care-attitude.  It's nearly perfect for Stark.  And the good thing about IRON MAN is that he's really a ""weapon"" designed and built by a brilliant man...not a super-power brought on by circumstance from a spider bite.<br /><br /> Early in the film, Stark is visiting Afghanistan to show off a new weapon.  He's soon kidnapped and nearly killed by a Taliban-like band of terrorists, who hold him hostage and force him to build a copy of his latest weapon.  Instead, with the help of a fellow prisoner (a doctor who both saves his life and dooms him to a lifetime of heart problems)...Stark brazenly builds an escape mechanism.<br /><br />I really hate to give away more plot...because it's fun to watch the story unwind.  Downey is fully of great energy, and could carry the movie on his own.  Fortunately for us, we've also got Gweneth Paltrow (Stark's unfortunately named assistant Pepper Potts).  Paltrow has been away for a few years raising a family (GREAT for her!), but I'd nearly forgotten that in the right role, she can really be a lot of ""saucy"" fun.  It's a clich&eacute;d role, but she makes the most of it.  Jeff Bridges is Stark's business-partner (and later nemesis), Obadiah Stane.  (Great name.)  Bridges is shaved bald, but has a big beard...making him a striking figure.  He's smooth, silky and creepy.  Shaun Taub, who was SO good in THE KITE RUNNER, is Stark's fellow prisoner, and he does another masterful job portraying a wise older gentleman with a streak of frisky humor and a big soft spot.  He's a very good character actor, and I hope to see more of him.<br /><br />Two fairly minor quibbles with the film.  1)  Terrance Howard, as Tony's longtime friend and military liaison...is somewhat lost in his role.  To me, it's now been awhile since he gave a performance that did much for me.  He's not fulfilling his early promise.  2)  The film needs a little more action.  This is also a back-handed compliment.  For once, the flying character actually looks fairly convincing...and I wanted to enjoy more pure thrills.  I love the witty banter, the crackling dialogue and I liked the action scenes.  I wanted just a bit more of Iron Man blowing stuff up.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like this movie is stuffy and unexciting...it's just that the action was just so much fun, I actually wanted more  (unlike the action in an overstuffed film like PIRATES 3, for example...where I was craving a break!).<br /><br />So while this movie is ONLY popular entertainment...it's the best kind.  Fun, fast, witty, exciting and well-acted.  And with Robert Downey firmly in charge...it's a far cut above the average.  Absolutely for ""non-fans"" too!!",Iron Man

Well, from the endless photos of Gwyneth Paltrow looking gorgeous, wearing very short skirts, and very high heels, in the press, I guess that she has a small role in it? I didn't see any photos of Robert Downey Jnr promoting the movie, it all seemed to focus on Gwyneth's very long legs.<br /><br />From the impressive beginning, you know that Iron Man is going to work. Although the VFX do feel similar at times to Transformers (done by the same company, Industrial Light & Magic, don't you know), it succeeds where Spiderman 3 spectacularly failed. Not only is Robert perfect for the Tony Stark/Iron Man role, he's cute as well. Hello!<br /><br />The story is basically like this: Tony Stark is CEO of Stark Industries, which produces really hi-tech weapons for the military. After his father's death, Tony inherited the company, and is now a billionaire. He has a fancy house, and a love for women. Who he then gets his assistant to throw out once he's finished with them. When in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test, his convoy is attacked, and he is injured, and taken hostage, but his life is saved by a doctor. When the terrorists force Tony to reproduce the weapon, he builds an impressive suit of armour, and escapes. The suit gets destroyed but is rebuilt in the US, where it gives Tony what else, but superhuman strength. He wants revenge.<br /><br />The special effects & technology used in this movie will absolutely blow you away. I mean, wow! It's absolutely breath taking. I'm not going to ruin this movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, but go, go, go! The action scenes in themselves are unreal. Not only do they work, but they take your breath away.<br /><br />The supporting cast was amazing. Gwyneth played the part for Pepper really well, and even managed to run a little in skyscraper heels. How does she manage it? I can barely walk in heels never mind run. Terrence Howard I have a feeling might get a bigger role hopefully in the next movie, it's certainly hinting that way. Jeff Bridges as the bad guy was unbelievable. The bald head really gave me the creeps, and gave the character an extra something. He's a seriously unlikeable character, and makes you root for Tony even more. And for all those reviewers who have complained that Samuel L Jackson is listed in the cast, but doesn't appear - hello duh??? I'll give you a hint. His scene was not left on the cutting room floor. He does appear. You just have to find the fast forward button. Put it this way, there will definitely be a sequel.<br /><br />I cannot wait to get this movie on DVD. Hopefully, it will be two discs (no bare bones DVDs for me!), loaded with extras and I want LOADED!!! I want to know how they did this, how they did that, and I want to see Robert in training. Woohoo. They can go all out with the extras on this DVD so lets hope they do.<br /><br />All I can say is go see this movie. You will not regret it.",Iron Man
4027700,B001I1NGHY, A1X15AQVSCKKRG,5.0, Excellent adaption of the comic book hero!!!!!!!!!,"Wow. Wow. Talk about a great film forget about the people who say this movie fails. Iron Man the movie is not only a great adaptation of the comic hero but is a great movie in general. It has it all: Special effects, great acting, interesting, realistic characters and a very modern story. Of course this is also attributed to the fact that comic book itself has all these qualities as well. For anyone who wants more of Iron Man after watching the movie, I would highly suggest getting in the comic you won't be disappointed!!!<br /><br />(Spoilers)<br />The comic of course was created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Larry Lieber, and Don Heck.<br /><br />The film follows the comic book very well (with a couple of alterations such as it taking place in the West Coast instead of the East Coast for example).<br /><br />Backstory: Iron Man or should I say Tony Stark (who in my opinion is one of the most underrated comic book heroes who doesn't quite the same publicity as Bob Kane's Batman) is a wealthy socialite who makes his life building and selling weapons. In a way just like Bruce Wayne, Tony Stark is a business superhero. Also, unlike Spider-Man, The Hulk and other comic book heroes there isn't a mutant or radioactive, gamma force that gives the hero his power, the power lies in the man's own ability to use his intellect, wits, bravery and judgment to combat the villains and problems he encounters.<br /><br />Tony Stark, Iron Man fights against a corporation/terrorist group known as Ten Rings in Afghanistan. In the comic book, Iron Man has many adventures fighting groups that have profited and used his own weapon systems from Stark Industries.<br /><br />Stark is forced to create a replica of one of his Jericho missiles for the group or face death. Worse yet, Stark having felt a blast that has left shrapnel near his heart MUST wear a chest plate to protect his heart. Yinsen (another prisoner) is the man who has kept Stark alive and  helps create the prototype of Iron Man with him. Yinsen helps Tony get the necessary time to get Iron Man up and running. This leads to an impressive special effects action sequence that led to a lot of clapping and cheering with the audience I saw it with.<br /><br />After this recovery from death and from the words of Yinsen who tells him not to waste his life, Stark has a major epiphany. He no longer wants to make weapons of destruction, he wants to save lives. His business partner Obadiah Stone does not share Stark's new vision and this leads to several dramatic scenes and more superb special effects with Iron Man. I will not spoil what else happens except that it's excellent.<br /><br />Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with Jon Favreau who said he was going to make a movie that would make lovers of the comic book happy but also make a movie simple enough that you didn't have to be an expert in it. What a smart guy he is. Jon is a good director but this was by far his biggest project. I mean Marvel wants to make a franchise of Iron Man just like they did with Spider-Man so a lot was riding on the line and Favreau delivered a home run!!!<br /><br />Speaking of home runs, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man was unbelievable I cannot think now in retrospect a better pick for the role. Jeff Bridges was great and Gwyneth Paltrow were also very good.  I'am glad they went with this cast and didn't go for the younger cast which would not have achieved the same results of this very adult oriented comic book hero's life.<br /><br />Again going back to why this movie is so successful: It's not dumb down, we got a moral dilemma with a guy coming to grips over the destruction that comes from his business but is starting to correct it, we got several shots at the corporate culture putting profit ahead of lives, we get a nice romantic storyline here, we  have multidimensional characters, and lastly we got great special effects. On top of all this we have a good attempt to follow the comic book hero.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say if what I say hasn't convinced you that Iron Man is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie in general then there's nothing I can do. However, you will be missing out on one heck of a great movie. Thumbs way up!!!!!!!!!!!",Iron Man
4027701,B001I1NGHY, AUGABW5AS2OXM,5.0, Stupendous Movie!,This movie was everything that I had hoped for. Once again a Marvel<br />comic book hero has made a good movie. Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent<br />job of portraying Iron Man(Tony Stark). Tony Stark is the CEO of Stark<br />Industries who manufactures weapons. He is in Afghanistan when his<br />helicopter is blown from the air and he is captured. He is held hostage<br />by al-Quaida terrorists. He is ordered to construct a Jericho missile.<br />On the sly he builds an Iron Man suit. It has weapons and flies at supersonic speeds. He stages a daring escape. He also suffers heart damage during his capture. He comes up with an instrument to help with this condition. He returns to America and fine tunes his invention. He decides to use his invention to fight the forces of evil. Jeff Bridges<br />plays his business mentor and pardner who is trying to take his company away from him. They wind up in a pitched battle. The special effects used by Iron Man are breathtaking and fabulous. This is a must see movie. The<br />scene after the credits adds to the dimension of the movie. A fantastic movie.,Iron Man
4027702,B001I1NGHY, A2KW2KWKABNYNO,5.0, The Best Superhero Movie So Far...,"I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.<br /><br />The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.<br /><br />The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.<br /><br />The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.<br /><br />Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.<br /><br />Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.<br /><br />Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.<br /><br />Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. As for it's Blu-Ray value, it's a must-own. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!",Iron Man
4027703,B001I1NGHY, A2K2RI0ZNI78UD,4.0, A Not-So-Perfect But INVINCIBLE Hero,"This was definitely a good movie. I'm a thirteen-year-old girl, and I think that -- if and ONLY if you skip through a certain part about ten minutes into the movie -- it is suitable for all ages, though some little kids would likely get scared. Why did I want to watch Iron Man? Basically I absolutely love Marvel, and my friend absolutely loves Robert Downey Jr's character of Iron Man. So when I settled down to watch the first movie, I was expecting only the best.<br /><br />Near the beginning of the movie, as I said, there was a not-so-appropriate scene with Tony Stark aka Iron Man and a news reporter girl. I was watching it with my parents and my seven-year-old brother, and my parents turned it off. I wasn't allowed to see the rest for a while -- not until it was recommended by some very reliable people. When I was allowed to finish watching Iron Man, me and my dad saw the rest together. It was a great movie, with an epic playboy Tony, a nice likeable Pepper, a ruthless evil Obediah, and an awesome trusty Rhodey, not to mention the handy robot J.A.R.V.I.S.<br /><br />I won't spoil the plot, but that plot was awesome! As with all of Marvel's movies, it was the kind of thing that glues you in place till it's over. Tony was not the classic hero. In fact, he was a bit too egotistical. But although he was nothing like your Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman, he still had that great superhero appeal. And he wanted to help people, which is always a good sign.<br /><br />Yes, Tony Stark was played by Robert Downey Jr. If you know a bit about that particular actor... well, you know he is a bit like Iron Man, only not a hero. But let's not think too much about the actors' personal lives -- Robert did an awesome job at portraying Tony. It was really incredible, what made the movie so great. Yes, it was the director; yes, it was the scriptwriter; yes, it was the epic Marvelness; yes, it was the designers; yes, it was totally the other actors; but most of all, it was the performance of Downey. Congratulations, Robert!<br /><br />All in all, Iron Man was a fantastic movie. I would be more than willing to rewatch it several times over; but, then again, there are quite a few movies I like to rewatch. But Iron Man is definitely worth watching at least once.",Iron Man
4027704,B001I1NGHY, AKAHV3U3QKED8,4.0, Great movie - Disappointing sound,"We've all seen the movie by now and know how good it is, so I don't need to review the movie itself.  The video quality is great like it should be for a Blu-Ray, however, the sound was a little disappointing!  The sound is only Dolby D, not DTS like most Blu-rays, so you don't get the ""full"" sound like usual.  That's the only bad thing I can say about quality or video itself.",Iron Man
4027705,B001I1NGHY, A11PTCZ2FM2547,4.0, This lead in the pants is actually enjoyable,"I try not to get too wrapped up into movies based on comic books (er, graphic novels, excuse moi); I tend to find them too trite and superfluous.  But I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, and Downey's astounding performance in IRON MAN is the stellar exception to my disdain for this action hero genre.  Downey brings a rich authenticity and ebullient eccentricity to every role he plays, and this is certainly the case here; his portrayal of billionaire weapons designer Tony Stark is humorous, compelling, and--yes, even in an over the top super hero flick--believable.  Even rocketing through the skies in his IRON MAN suit Downey's Stark is funny, vulnerable, and pragmatic--in other words, all too human.  While demonstrating a new weapon in the Afghanistan wilderness before assembled Army VIPs he nonchalantly sips his drink while behind him chaos reigns supreme, and it's grand fun to watch.<br /><br />Is the story silly and farfetched?  Yes.  Is it occasionally sophomoric and extreme?  Yes.  Does it require a titanic suspension of disbelief?  Of course, but who cares?  Following a nasty stint as a hostage to some snarling jihadists (and escaping via an iron suit of his own making), Stark disavows the weapons of mass carnage his company has made, and focuses entirely on the technology to replicate the iron suit utilizing state-of-the-art technology.  This places him at odds with longtime business partner Obadiah Stane (played magnificently by Jeff Bridges), who, incidentally, is working on a suit of his own.  And of course this leads at breakneck speed to the ultimate battle of the Iron Men, who create carnage and mayhem in overload volume in downtown LA--all while Stark's personal assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning) looks on in terror and dismay.  The special effects are terrific, the action sequences heartpounding, and the pacing fast and furious; IRON MAN may be based on comic books, but this is one super hero film worth relishing again and again.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.",Iron Man
4027706,B001I1NGHY, A2NYP1VC6FOFER,5.0, Iron Man 2 Disc Blu ray Special Edition,"Anchored by a top rate performance by Robert Downey Jr., this  exciting, well directed take on Iron Man will go down as one of the best comic book movies out this generation.  The respect and love of the filmmakers for the material is evident throughout the film.  Marvel studios could not have chosen a better film to be their first independently financed and produced movie.  The movie set the bar high for all the Marvel films that came after (and it is debatable whether or not any film, including the sequel to Iron Man, ever reached that bar again).<br /><br />The 2 Disc Blu-Ray Ultimate Edition is fantastic. On the first disc you get a 47 minute documentary that explores the Iron Man comic book, from its origins to the current story lines he is involved in (at least at the time of the film's original release).  The writers and artists who have worked on Iron Man over the years take part in the documentary, discussing what changes they made to the character and why.  As someone who didn't really follow the Iron Man comic book, I found the documentary to be fascinating.  Also on the first disc is a collection of deleted/extended scenes, running for a total of 24 minutes.  Most of these are superfluous additions, bits of dialogue or action scenes that don't add anything to the story and were almost certainly taken out for pacing reasons.  There is a feature that focuses on the 4 different suits in the movie.  You can view each suit from any angle, checking out the function/feature of each piece.  I like the concept, but it takes to long to load each section.  What we're missing on this disc is something I really wanted...a director's commentary and/or a cast commentary.<br /><br />The 2nd disc is devoted to the making of the movie itself.  The highlight is a 7 part documentary that runs almost 2 hours.  It covers all aspects of the production, from initial designs, through shooting, and into the editing and special effects.  It was filmed concurrently with the production, so you get a mixture of ""on the set"" interviews and interviews done later looking back at the production.  As a whole, it is a well done documentary.  It isn't a classic like Heart of Darkness (which covers the filming of Apocalypse Now) or The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys (which covers 12 Monkeys), but it isn't a pure fluff piece.  I highly recommend watching this.  The 2nd disc also contains a 27 minute featurette on the special effects and Robert Downey Jr.'s screen test,<br /><br />In the end, the movie is the star here, but this is a very well done special edition.  If/when they re-release the blu-ray (probably around the release of Iron Man 3), I don't know what else they could add to make it a better edition, except for a commentary track or two.",Iron Man

4027708,B001I1NGHY, A2J3XH0D9J12EC,5.0, Really...Really Good Movie!,"Okay, so I'm following the whole super hero thing primarily because they are great action films that allow me to use the full functionality of my 3D TV along with my 7.1 surround sound system.  I almost never go to a movie any more.  After taking my grandson to the movies to see super 8, I may never go to a movie again unless it's an IMAX movie.  Super 8 was way better on blu ray in my living room.  I kid you not. By the way, that is also a very good movie that is full of nuance.I just wait for the Blu Ray release, make some popcorn and sit back and enjoy.  It's way cheaper.  That being said, this movie well made the grade for such an endeavor.<br /><br />The storyline is tight, well told, well paced and well acted.<br /><br />About the only complaint that I can make has to do with the sound.  I found myself using close-caption since some parts of the movie was inaudible.<br /><br />This tragedy...yes I said tragedy is found in alot of movies now-a-days.  What the heck are the producers thinking when they know that great technology is at their fingertips.  What's all of the mumbling about?  I'm sure that I'm not the only one screaming about this.  Why mumble when you can speak. Clearly. Decisively. With intent. So that you can be heard. Through one or eight speakers.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this cannot be blamed on the actors. Weight must fall on the directors and producers.  If the mike can pick up the slightest sound, then have the actor stand back a little to match the mike. How hard is this?<br /><br />Fortunately, movies made since the time of the release of this one seem to be made better and with more attention paid regarding spoken voice audibility.  If you are going to see the avengers this year then you must see this movie since it is an integral part of that storyline. Not withstanding the crappy audio, I still highly recomment this movie because it is a great storyline with stellar action.",Iron Man

This movie changed my perspective on all of that.  I had been skeptical of even watching this particular film.  Before this movie I honestly didn't find Robert Downey Jr. to be a compelling actor.  Boy was I wrong.  Downey is spectacular as Tony Stark and has proved to me to be a very capable iconic character actor. (His portrayal of Holmes was great too but that's another review).  He's funny, snarky, flawed, and not the traditional hero that we are all so used to, which made me root for him even more.  He makes us love Tony despite the fact that the character's demeanor is meant to not be liked.  The graphics are great, the story is strong, and kudos for Gwen Paltrow. Her role as Pepper Potts is also nontraditional.  She's not the damsel in distress we're all use to, and is the perfect opposite for Downey's role. This is a refreshing new take of a superhero story and has thrown me head first into the whole Marvel universe as a new fan. Strong Cast and just a fun movie to watch.  Highly suggested for everyone, even the non superhero types out there.",Iron Man

In fact, I think I'll put it in the DVD player right now and see how well they did!<br /><br />It was a surprise to find a really great, entertaining movie and not feel like I had to endure the heaps and gobs of special effects to get back to the actual story.

4027719,B001I1NGHY, A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,4.0, Pleasantly Surprised,"Iron Man is a character that I never in my history of comic book fandom cared about. When talk first started circulating about an Iron Man movie, my thought was ""I guess they're hitting them all eventually,"" considering that we've already been subjected to Ghost Rider and Daredevil/Elektra. Especially now that Marvel has founded their very own studio so that they can produce movies themselves instead of selling the rights and points on the back end to others, it seems fairly certain that their catalog of heroes isn't going to be closing itself off to the multiplex any time soon.<br /><br />  But after seeing Iron Man, I'm sort of ok with that. Provided of course, that the movies they make are more like Iron Man and less like the Fantastic Four franchise. It isn't that Iron Man is any amazing special film, but it isn't terrible. In the spectrum of superhero movies, it falls somewhere maybe slightly behind the first X-Men, but well in front of the awful third one. It isn't Spiderman II, Hellboy, or Batman Begins. But it certainly isn't Daredevil.<br /><br />  There is one thing and one thing alone that makes Iron Man such an enjoyable movie. Robert Downey Jr. The script is ok, and Jon Favreau does a pretty decent ass job in the director's chair for it too, but it is Downey that carries the weight of the movie on his metal clad shoulders. He plays Tony Stark with such a flair for delightful bastardness, yet does not fall short at the moments when he must also show real emotion, real conflict as his character realizes his place in the world.<br /><br />  Downey brings to the table the most enjoyable performance in a popcorn movie since Johnny Depp set sail as Captain Jack Sparrow in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Despite Stark's personal conflicts, he is the least angst-ridden super hero in recent memory, delighting in every moment he spends refining and eventually kicking evil ass in his suit. It is an interesting twist on the paradigm of the costumed hero that Stark is more weighed down by the impact on the world he has created as a normal person, albeit a larger than life normal person, than he does as a costumed crusader. His joy in being a superhero reminds us of something often forgotten in many of the overly dark failures in comic book adaptations the last few years, the reason so many little kids want to be superheroes in the first place: it looks kind of fun.",Iron Man

The film's pace is brisk and there is nearly no downtime. Downey Jr. perfectly portrays Tony Stark, an immature billionair turned empathetic hero. Jeff Bridges rarely plays a villain, but turns out a believable performance that is a good counterpart to Downey's character. Terrance Howard has a somewhat minor role, but Howard pulls it off greatly; it is too bad that he was replaced for the sequal. Paltrow's take as Stark's assistant is the heart of the film. I hope the sequal is just as good.",Iron Man

(so far),"I have watched this movie at leasst once a week since it was released on DVD,I saw it on screen.<br />SOmeone was paying attention when they made this one.<br />I was a kid in the  60s an read a lot of Marvel comics on a regular basis. (Missed the X-men,but they are boring and lame)<br />This film come as close to perfect as the medium can possibly get  for capturing the spirit of the REAL Marvel comic.As well as beating out EVERY other superhero move EVER made.<br />OK the first spiderman came close, but SFX werent quite there (The series deterioated rapidly)<br /> The nearest experience was when the first Superman came out (yes a totaly silly movie now, )<br />People criticize it for  the  ""building the armour scenes"" those scenes gave the film its total feeling of being very real and believable. Robt. Downey was great.(He will be as  remembered for the role as Clayton Moore is for the Lone Ranger!!)<br />The story took priority over  flash and SFX. I know that is dangerous in these days when brain dead ADHD teens are the main target for most film makers these days. If you have truly lived (born before 1960!) this is the best .

4027728,B001I1NGHY, AIFXFHO2N9WJB,5.0, Some Heroes Are Built...,"Several years ago when rumors really began heating up about the possibility of an actual Iron Man movie coming to the big screen, I thought that there would be no way it would really work. Sure, comic book movies were on the rise, and director Sam Raimi had shown to us that a man really can web-sling and wall-crawl, and Bryan Singer proved that super-powered mutants do exist; however, a man in a metal suit flying around still seemed like an awfully daunting task to make us believe. Now, these weren't the first rumors of an Iron Man movie coming to the big screen, they were just the most credible. No, rumors of this project have existed since around 1990, when it was being bounced from studio to studio. Even some Hollywood A-listers, such as Nicolas Cage and Tom Cruise, were being tossed around as possible stars for the vehicle, and director Quentin Tarentino was one of the primary contenders for the directing job (who knows what the movie would have ended up like if any of this had actually come true). However, none of that ever came close to fruition, and the project lay dormant for almost 20 years. That was until director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey, Jr. made the movie into an incredible reality that took the 2008 summer box office by storm.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a rich, powerful, and undeniably brilliant weapons manufacturer, womanizer, and self-centered man who lives the life so many dream of. But that all changes when he finds himself captured by a terrorist organization who want to use him to create weapons solely for their own evil purposes. With his options limited, Stark does the one thing no one ever expected him to do, he becomes a hero. Clad in a metallic suit of his own design, Tony finally knows what his purpose is in life, and as the hero known as ""Iron Man"" he now has the means by which to protect the people he once put in harm's way.<br /><br />Truth be told, the long wait between those first rumors in the 90's to now, was probably just what the movie needed to become a true success, for several reasons. For starters, the technology necessary to create the obligatory visual effects sequences (of which there are many) involving the metal-clad hero have finally become available, as proven by the smash hit ""Transformers"". Prior to that film I don't believe some of the visuals achieved in this movie would have been nearly as convincing to audiences. Second, the perfect casting choice was made in the form of Robert Downey, Jr., a talented actor who has had his fair share of troubles (many of which are surprisingly similar to Tony Stark's in the comic books), and one whose star power wasn't great enough that his private life would outshine anything done on the screen. Lastly, Marvel was finally able to create their own movie studio, allowing them full creative control and ensuring that the character and story were as true to the source material as possible. It's for all these reasons listed here, and even some that aren't, that ""Iron Man"" became such a successful adaptation, and had the film come to fruition sooner, who knows what the outcome would have been.<br /><br />The story for ""Iron Man"" is two-fold: on one hand the story is a tale of redemption for a man who has lived a life of self-indulgence and freedom from any sort of consequences to his actions; while on the other, it is a fairly faithful to the source material origin story of a new kind of superhero that was born out of one man's sheer will-power to live. As a moviegoer and comic book aficionado I love when an adaptation of one of my heroes comes to life on the big screen as both a faithful representation (or as close as one can get to decades of comic history in only a couple of hours), as well as a really strong film that isn't just a bunch of summer popcorn movie fluff.<br /><br />The screenplay written by the writing teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby (""Children of Men"") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway (""Punisher: War Zone"") was surprisingly cohesive given the number of hands stirring the pot, so to speak. Generally, when the number of writers goes beyond two, the chances for the film actually working out all that well dwindle significantly; however, ""Iron Man"" proved to be one of those rare exceptions to the rule. Filled with plenty of humor, action, drama, and a dash of romance, the story for ""Iron Man"" is easily one of the best origin adaptations for a superhero that I have ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />As great as the story was, I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few of the minor problems that crept into the film. These problems aren't in any way overtly distracting from the end result, but they should be addressed all the same. First, from a purely comic geek standpoint the film's location was completely wrong, Stark is based out of New York City (as are most of Marvel's heroes), yet the film takes place predominantly in California. Personally, this alteration to the origin didn't actually bother me, but I know it did some purists, and I can understand why. Second, the attempted twist involving the film's villain was poorly executed, and was easily seen from the very beginning; however, I don't believe the intent was to actually make the primary villain's reveal all that much of a shocker. But there was obviously some attempt made to surprise the audience, and if it actually succeeded it would only be for those not paying close attention. This problem wasn't like the first, where I didn't really care either way, because it did kind of frustrate me that more effort wasn't put into this twist to make it somewhat surprising. Like I said, in the end these problems weren't anything major, but they still existed nonetheless.<br /><br />For this film, fledgling Marvel Studios wisely chose to sort of buck the Hollywood system by going with some truly surprising, yet inspired choices for both cast and crew. Choosing Jon Favreau (""Elf"") as the director was a shock to many, and even caused some to wonder just how good this film could actually be. Sure, Favreau proved he could handle family comedy with ""Elf"", and some of his early work is fairly dramatic, and as far as visual effects goes, he did a decent enough job on ""Zathura""; yet, would he have what it takes to tackle something as big as a comic book icon's first major film adaptation? Apparently, the answer was yes, and any questioning of the decision was quickly silenced when Favreau debuted some footage during Comic-Con, much to the vast delight of many a comic geek. The other shocking choice, and arguably the most disputed was that of casting troubled actor Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Even though he hardly seemed the proper fit for the character, Robert perfectly captured the very nature of Tony Stark right down to his physical appearance, quick-wit, and attitude, for all intents and purposes Downey, Jr. was Tony Stark through and through.<br /><br />Comprising the supporting cast of characters, were a group of talented actors and actresses whose hiring weren't nearly as scrutinized. Gwyneth Paltrow (""Shakespeare in Love""), although not my first choice for the role, turned out to be the perfect Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's personal assistant. It was a decidedly different role for Gwyneth who typically does more dramatic work, and even more surprising, while at the same time a very smart move on her part, was that this was the role she chose as her first project post-pregnancy hiatus. Joining her was Jeff Bridges (""Arlington Road"") as Obadiah Stane, Tony's mentor and right-hand man in operating the day-to-day activities of Stark Industries. For fans of Jeff's work, many will be surprised by how different he looks as this character, with his shaved head and full beard, Jeff is almost unrecognizable from his appearances in virtually every other movie he's ever made. Rounding out the main supporting cast members is Terrence Howard (""Four Brothers"") as James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes, an Air Force pilot, and close friend to Tony Stark. Terrence was again another terrific choice, and he really played well off of anything Robert Downey, Jr. would throw at him. Their typically light-hearted conversations full of playfully intended put-downs and sarcasm really helped to solidify their close, almost brotherly bond the two men share with one another. All in all, the casting for this film, whether heavily questioned or just unquestionably accepted, couldn't have been any better as each of the cast members delivered top-notch performances.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" was one of 2008's biggest blockbusters, second only to ""The Dark Knight"", and the film rightfully earns its place amongst the best comic book adaptations ever made. Boasting a strong story, visually stunning special effects, brilliant casting decisions, and just some good old fashioned fun, ""Iron Man"" is not just a comic book blockbuster, but a great movie that audiences will enjoy over and over again. By the way, be sure to watch after the credits for a bonus scene that offers a hint of things to come.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and brief sensuality.",Iron Man
4027729,B001I1NGHY, A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,5.0, Armored Avenger Hits the Big Screen!,"My favorite comic book character has always been Iron Man.  I was excited when I heard that there was going to be an ""Iron Man"" movie, and even more thrilled when I saw the first trailer.  The movie more than lived up to the hype.  I mean, come on...who wouldn't dream of owning a powerful suit of red/gold armor like this?<br /><br />There are two big reasons why the movie is so well done.  First, there's Jon Favreau.  Favreau is a comic book fan.  I've said for a long time now, that you have to know the comic book character in order to do a good movie.  Richard Donner read Superman comics.  Nolan is a Batman fan.  Sam Raimi has been a Spider-Man fan since he was a kid.  Favreau knows the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man.  And Favreau pulls out all the stops to turn in one of the best superhero movies of all time.  I put this one up there with the two Batman movies, Superman: The Movie, and Spider-Man 2.<br /><br />The second big reason is Robert Downey Jr.  He makes Stark jump off the screen.  Downey Jr. gives Tony Stark all of the suaveness of the multi-billion dollar tycoon as well as his humanity.  Downey Jr. can deliver a line as good as any of the best actors out there.  He's always been that good.  It's a shame that his various ""distractions"" have prevented him from showing everyone how good he is...until now!  This is Downey Jr.'s ""coming back"" role.<br /><br />It seems Stark only cares about making money, no matter who it hurts.  And in this case, he's given a rude awakening when he finds out that his company, which manufactures weapons, is killing many people around the world.  It is at this point that he decides to put an end to the company, and Iron Man is created, initially to save his life, but also to help bring his own company down and destroy the weapons that he has created.<br /><br />Enter Obadiah Stane, wonderfully portrayed by Jeff Bridges.  He's Stark's second-in-command, and there's more going on within Stane's own agenda than meets the eye.  The last thing he wants is to see the company go under.  After all, helped get the company off the ground with Tony Stark's father.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is perfectly cast as Stark's loyal secretary, Pepper Potts.  She seems to be the only one who sees that the change in Tony Stark goes beyond the damage to his heart.  For Pepper Potts, Tony Stark has finally found his heart.  Paltrow plays Pepper Potts without going over-the-top.  She seems to have an attraction for him, but something holds her back, and the scenes with Paltrow and Downey Jr. are very good.<br /><br />Finally, we have Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend, James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes.  While in the comic, Rhodes is a former pilot.  Here, he's an air force colonel with a lot of power within the military.  Howard does a decent job with Rhodes, and who can forget his great line as he's walking by the suit of Iron Man armor, ""Next time!""  (If you aren't familiar with the comic, Rhodes takes over the mantle of Iron Man for a time and even eventually becomes ""War Machine."")<br /><br />The special effects are absolutely brilliant.  Seeing Iron Man soaring through the skies with his boot jets is a treat.  He looks real slick in that suit of armor, and it's especially enjoyable seeing him go into action for the first time in his red and gold suit.<br /><br />The best superhero movies are those in which the focus is on the character, rather than the superhero.  Tony Stark is a character we like, and Robert Downey Jr. is the reason for bringing him to life on screen. And through Tony Stark, Iron Man works all the more when he's finally on screen.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I wished for the movie, it's that there was a longer climactic battle scene between Iron Man and Iron Monger.  I was also hoping that some of the battle would take place in the sky instead of entirely on the ground.  I wanted Favreau to really show what Iron Man can do.  But something like this is easily overlooked because the movie is so well done.<br /><br />Also, ""Iron Man"" is just plain fun!  It never takes itself too seriously, nor does it really tread into darker realms like some superhero movies.  But then, Iron Man isn't supposed to be a dark character.  Wearing bright red and gold armor, he represents a hero from way back when; when heroes were knights who wore armor and helped to defend those who couldn't defend themselves.  Stan Lee himself said that this was a big reason why he created a superhero who wears armor.<br /><br />I can't wait to see more of Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. in ""Iron Man 2.""  I have a strange feeling that it will be even better than this one...and that's saying a lot.",Iron Man
4027730,B001I1NGHY, A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,5.0, Iron Man (Blu-ray),"Movie - 4.5<br /><br />I first saw the movie in theaters with zero expectations. I never followed the comics, let alone pay any attention to the fact that Robert Downey Jr. was starring in the lead role. Thank goodness that happened, because I was blown away by the end. The whole guilt and redemption angle on the character of Tony Stark struck a very deep resonance with me, as I'm a big fan of ""comeback"" stories where the protagonist falls so far off his high horse, only to realize his mistakes, then use those events as a learning tool and lead himself to do greater good. Nowadays, it's hard to see the good in most people because of how lost we are in the desires and routine ineptitudes of society. More often than not, our lives revolve around either money, sex, or some other kind of self-indulgence. Granted, it's not a bad thing to wanna' be happy, but I thought this particular story put a certain kind of perspective on the corporate and war profiteering elements that exist in today's world. And what better an example of how to explore the truth and consequences of this by having a billionaire weapons manufacturer have a a change in character and try to make a difference from the heart instead of the wallet? I really enjoyed the movie's plot and characters from beginning to end. Downey Jr. plays Stark down to a T, and the supporting cast is fun to watch from Pepper to Rhodie (too bad Howard won't be back, though), even to Jarvis. If anything, my only problem is the lack in depth of a true supervillain. While Jeff Bridges does a great job as Obidiah Stane, the movie iss missing that extra sense of ambition that really separates the ideals of most bad guys. As a setup movie, however (for the supposed trilogy), I rank this in the upper echelon along Batman Begins as one of my favorites. And if history has dictated anything, it's that the 2nd act of a trilogy has always greatly outdone its predecessor. Can't wait till the next one comes out.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />Colors are very vibrant from skin tones to backgrounds to all the shiny versions of the Iron Man suits. Paramount has done a spectacular job on the transfer, making this instant demo material for friends, family, or business alike. In particular, the cave break and liberation of Gulmira (including the jet chase) scenes are worth watching over and over again just for the flashy lights and sleek cinematography. Black levels handle extremely well during cave, night, and other dimly-lit scenes keeping most, if not all, kinds of object detail looking crisp and sharp. Contrast is equally suiting and really helps the overall photography adding a complimentary sense of depth and dimensionality between people, objects, and backgrounds. The only slight problem one might have is with the darker cave scene. They used a different camera for those shots resulting in a slightly noisier presentation, which is what happens on a normal basis with darker shots anyway, but that's about the only possible imperfection and may not even effect your own personal score if you're not being picky. But other than that, show off your Blu-ray setup with this movie.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Accompanying the flawless video transfer is an equally flawless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track. Ramin Djwadi's score, while a tad underwhelming composition-wise, is displaced well-enough to help create just the right amount of immersion for each scene, and dialogue is clear through the center channel. Directionality and separation are especially notable during scenes of gunfire or jet-propelled flight. Again, refer to the cave break and liberation of Gulmira with the jet chase to hear what I'm talking about. Maybe even thrown in the Mk. II's test flight for good measure. LFEs are astounding in terms of bass depth and other low frequency presence. I personally like to use Stark's takeoff to Gulmira and jump into supersonic speed during his run from the F-22s as go-to showcase material. So make sure your theater system has all the right settings, then crank that baby up to wow your guests.<br /><br />Extras - 5.0<br /><br />Thanks in big part to the hours of extras on both the feature and additional 25GB disc, I actually learned quite a bit of informative things about the Iron Man franchise as a whole and the respectable hard work that went into producing this summer blockbuster. Ironically enough, I now see Iron Man as a sort of Marvel parallel to DC's Batman, only with less of the dark psychology and grimness involved with Bruce Wayne's tragic childhood. On top of being presented completely in HD, the special features are loads of fun to watch in themselves, and I don't think I've ever been as thoroughly entertained by just the making of portion. If you like the movie, you'll really like these extras.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />For a setup of an eventual trilogy, I rank this as the top tier with Batman Begins as the other best of its kind. The characters and script are highly entertaining, and the story has just the right amount of depth to bring about my empathy. Throw in the demo quality video and audio and a largely informative array of special features, and you've got yourself one of the years best Blu-ray packages.

There's more of the opening ambush with Tony Stark being more proactive. We also see more footage of Rhodes and it quickly becomes apparent that he was the character with the most scenes cut from the film. We also see Tony and Pepper Potts attend another party.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the impressive ""I Am Iron Man,"" a 108 minute making of documentary that can be viewed in seven segments or altogether, taking us through various aspects of the production. For example, we are taken step-by-step through the construction of the Iron Man armor with Robert Downey Jr. cracking jokes while being fitted for it. It's amazing how much of the suit is practical and looks really good in person. This is due in large part to the genius of the late-great Stan Winston and his company. Also included is plenty of soundstage footage of scenes being filmed.<br /><br />""The Invincible Iron Man"" is a six-part documentary on the comic book, tracing the history of the character. Stan Lee says that he modeled Stark after Howard Hughes, for the most part. He also mentions that he was never fully satisfied with the look of the armor - hence its many changes over the years. This doc also covers various key characters and storylines in excellent detail with several people who worked on the title over the years talking about their contribution to the mythos. This is a very well done overview of the comic book.<br /><br />""Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man"" examines the CGI work that went into realizing Iron Man's powers, like flying, his repulsors, and so on.

4027737,B001I1NGHY, A26X2TG93OTXVU,4.0, Iron man fires on all thrusters; and does NOT disappoint,"There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flick...let's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.<br /><br />Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out back story. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.<br /><br />The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, ""no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can."" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic Lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liaison, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show ""Dinner for Five"" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.<br /><br />One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.<br /><br />Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the back story and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years.",Iron Man
4027738,B001I1NGHY, A2NJO6YE954DBH,5.0," The best comic book superhero movie since ""Spider-Man 2""","Once again I begin with a warning that you need to sit through the really, really long credits for what might be the best cameo appearance since Sean Connery showed up as King Richard the Lionheart at the end of ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000092T6M"">Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves</a>.""  That was the last time I remember people really applauding a cameo in a film, although I should point out that everybody left at the end of the first showing of ""Iron Man"" were True Believers who instantly recognized the actor and the character as soon as the first words were out of their mouth.  Ironically, the cameo by Stan Lee in the film seemed to go right by the audience, because there was no reaction to what was a pretty good gag (it happens when Stark shows up at the big party).<br /><br />Now that I have that bit of business out of the way, let me say that ""Iron Man"" is the best comic book superhero movie I have seen since ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW"">Spider-Man 2</a>.""  I would say that the latter is better, mainly on the strength of Alfred Molina's wonderful performance as the villain and the great fight sequences between Spidey and Doc Ock that take place on the vertical as well as the horizontal axis, but ""Iron Man"" might be the more solid film (i.e., lower top but higher bottom).  There was a point when the number of comic books that Marvel was putting out exploded (e.g., the New Universe titles) and I dispaired over all of the idiotic cloning with Spider-Man and was down to reading only two Marvel titles: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785107576"">Daredevil</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078512764X"">Iron Man</a>.  This was back when Frank Miller was doing DD and Tony Stark was a full-blown alcoholic.  Daredevil might have been cooler, but as Iron Man, Stark always had the advantage that he was a regular guy, by which I mean that he did not have any superpowers.  He was just a really smart guy who could invent the gadgets that would make Iron Man work (eat your heart out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000294TC4"">Ned Kelly</a>).  That is certainly what we get with director Jon Favreau's pre-summer blockbuster, with the added angst of Stark growing a conscience and using his armored alter-ego to help restore balance to his own little corner of the universe at war.<br /><br />Ultimately the best parts of the movie are the opening act, in which Stark is captured (Afghanistan today instead of Vietnam of the Sixties)and has to built the metallic grey Tin Woodsman on roids prototype armor, and the second act, where he works out the new suit.  This movie has two or three of the best violent slapstick gags you have ever seen in one of these movies, which engenders some of the biggest laughs.  The origin of the character is fairly faithful, for being updated, to what happened in ""Tales of Suspense"" #39, which was plotted by Stan Lee, scripted by his brother Larry Leiber, drawn by Don Heck, with a cover art by Jack Kirby (who created the character's original look, although it was Steve Ditko who first drew the red and gold armored version).  There certainly is more than a touch of ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570"">Transformers</a>"" to the way Stark dons the Iron Man armor, but as much as I would give credit to the specific effects in this movie, attention must be paid to the screenwriting teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby (""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N6TX1I"">Children of Men</a>"") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway.  For all of the humor in the script, there is a strong thread of serious stuff extending throughout this film.<br /><br />As Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., a superb actor whose skills in the verbal repartee department were honed on ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V8952K"">Ally McBeal</a>,"" may well be the most glib superhero we have seen on the silver screen.  Certainly he is more glib than we would every have suspected Stark to be, but of course Downey's personal life clearly echoes the character ark of his character (it is that resonance as well as his undeniable talents that make him perfect for the role).  As Pepper Potts, Gwenyth Paltrow is more of a romantic  figure for Stark than she was in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785118608"">comic book</a>, especially since Happy Hogan (director Favreau) has been relegated to a minor role as Stark's bodyguard to make room for the character of Jim Rhodes.  However, the point is not so much potential romance as it is the fact that with Paltrow we have an actress who can go toe to toe with Downey in quick paced nuanced conversation (although many will think that Downey's best scenes are with his robotic assistant with the fire extinguisher).  Besides, by have Rhodes instead of Hogan we not only get another acting talent on the level of the Downey and Paltrow with Terrence Howard, but as fans of the comic book know (and the movie acknowledges), one day down the road Jim is going to get to be in the red and gold suit.<br /><br />Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is set up as a godfather to Tony Stark and a regent to Stark Industries instead of being a rival munitions magnate, which provides a bit of Oedipal conflict to the proceedings and compels the big fight at the end to be with Iron Monger (I was actually hoping for Titanium Man even though I was half expecting the Mandarian).  But most people who come to see this movie are not going to know any of this stuff, and even most of the comic book fans who will end up making repeat trips to the theater to see this one are not going to be old enough to remember the original Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts who ended up with Happy Hogan versus the ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785121382"">The Ultimates</a>"" version of the character.  All that really matters is that the cast and characters are a perfect mesh and the people who put this movie together should be thinking not just about a sequel but about a series.  With this launching platform, Iron Man could well replace Superman in the Big Three of comic book superheroes in the movies along with Spider-Man and Batman.",Iron Man

Some pinhead executive at the movie studio/blu-ray production house thought it would be cute to require you to download some stupid software you're probably not going to use for ""extra features""  BEFORE you can even get to the main menu. I had to wait so long to watch it I thought the disc was defective. I had enough time to call Amazon and arrange a replacement. (Then I installed installed Windows XP to my MacBook and I was still waiting. If you've ever installed XP you know how long that takes too.) This means that each time I pop this Blu-ray into a new player, like if I take it to a friend's house,  I'm going to have to tell my friend(s): okay let's just wait an hour then we can watch the movie.

But this is only half of the movie: The other half: Iron Man action scenes are just flat out cool. The poses/angles they choose and CGI work are all great.

My second impression is that it would look nice in HD. Thankfully Marvel Studios and Paramount have delivered a great Blu Ray release w/ HD video.<br /><br />So the way the movie itself goes is typical super hero movie type stuff. If you aren't a fan of comic book style suspension of disbelief, please move on. You won't like this movie anymore than you did the other super hero movies out there.<br /><br />Tony Stark, the sort of spoiled, super intelligent and conceited owner of Stark Enterprises finds himself in an impossible situation. While traveling through Iraq to show off his great new weapons the Humvee he is in is attacked and he is captured. He awakens to find that one of his captors has installed an electro magnet in his chest to prevent mobile shrapnel from the explosion Tony was caught in from reaching his heart.<br /><br />In captivity he's asked to build one of his top of the line missiles for his captors, a Jericho missile. Instead he builds a prototype Iron Man suit and escapes. The experience changes his life and has him attempt to change his company and the world from the destruction he and has company have profited from.<br /><br />Action, betrayal, small amount of clumsy love and that is Iron Man in a nut shell.<br /><br />The video is presented via the AVC codec and looks amazing. The only areas of ""problem"" would be in the cave scenes. You can tell when the film stock changes or perhaps, if it was filmed in digital, grain was added to the video. The areas most affected are darker scenes and scenes where there is interaction between the prototype Iron Man suit (done in CG) and his environment and the terrorists. It's either an artistic decision or a choice to make the CG interaction less perceptible. It doesn't take away from the scenes and it doesn't detract from the movie.<br /><br />The audio is done in Dolby True-HD and sounds fantastic. Lows are low and highs are high. No clipping, no distortion and great separation of channels over all.<br /><br />Having bought quite a few Blu Ray discs, I'm painfully aware of the lack of HD extras. Not so with Iron Man. This release has 2 discs in it, one for the main feature and a few extras (deleted scenes) and one for quite a few interesting and in depth documentaries. And yes, the documentaries are ALL in HD. This may be the first Blu Ray disc I've purchased with all HD extras.<br /><br />Also included is a BD Live connection. I have not yet created an account and logged in to see what's available, but even if all you have access to is what's on the disc, the extras are amazing. Not sure about the BD Live extras.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a super hero movie with some amazing video, amazing audio and amazing extras, look no further than Iron Man on Blu Ray.<br /><br />FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING LONG LOAD TIMES:<br /><br />If you have a BD Live capable player, in the menus of your player, turn off ""auto download"" and set it to confirm (or something along those lines). The reason the movie takes ""forever"" to start when you first insert it is because the quiz portion from BD-Live needs to be downloaded and installed on your player. Just turn off auto install/connect and you should be good to go.<br /><br />And once it is installed the first time, assuming you wait, you won't see it again unless you get a new player and want to watch the movie.",Iron Man
4027743,B001I1NGHY, A3C6CZC2JP67VK,4.0, 4.5--The truth is.......................Downey flies high!,"Seriously, thanks god for Robert Downey Jr., the actor was brilliant in the movie, after watching the movie i couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the role of Tony stark, the guys was simply brilliant. Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors who can offer a lot more then he's given chances to prove himself. It's mostly because of his drug and alcohol problems but no one cannot deny that he's an outstanding actor who never acted in big budget movies. Not until now as Iron Man..<br /><br />Jon Favreau was obviously given a lot of money and he invested it wisely and brought Comic successfully back to life. ""Iron Man"" has its holes, like not so convincing start but everything since the time Stark returned from his captivity is good and entertaining story. As I said before Downey Jr. is a thing this movie needs, just like always excellent Jeff Bridges in role of Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />In this cast I didn't like Gwyneth Paltrow. She has some rough moments, and this definitely wasn't her best performance, but she didn't bring down the film by any means. Great supporting turns by Terence Howard as Tony's associate and erstwhile friend and Clark Gregg as a tight-lipped fed make director Jon Favreau's job helming this adaptation a HUGELY better result than the flavorless ""DareDevil"" from 2003.<br /><br />So ""Iron Man"" is good for fun and as blockbuster that would fill cinemas, but for a place in 250 best movies, I think not. This is a satisfying film from at least three levels: for those who love superhero movies, it's great; for those who enjoy a good message movie, it's only BARELY preachy and always able to keep it frenetic and true; and as a summer film, it's large and captivating, never letting the viewer go till the credits (and perhaps even STILL during that)! While I cannot quite go all the way with 5 stars for this film, it's a very strong 4. A strong movie-going experience for most anyone who likes ""Summer"" films.",Iron Man

If you have one, write a review the voting system is for those who HAVEN'T purchased the item and whether or not the review was helpful in that decision.<br /><br />""Titanium Alloy Man"" just doesn't have the same ring to it as ""Iron Man"". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is ""The Merchant of Death"" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark almost literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.<br /><br />He uses the crude tools to build a suit of iron that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by becoming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. Heck, even the DVD is one of the top notch ones I've seen in recent years. As for the issue with TrueHD sound--Paramount has fixed that issue remanufacturing the BD and still meeting their release date.<br /><br />The extras are stunning as well. We get a full documentary ""I AM Iron Man"" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre-CGI work, design elements to on-the-set wire work involving Robert Downey, Jr. Director Jon Favreau (who also plays Happy in the film)manages to seamlessly combine CGI with pratical physical effects such as puppets and the men in suits. His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa. We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out. There are also stills galleries, screen test, a featurette ""Invincible Iron Man"" that gives us an idea about the development of the characterwith interviews featuring many of the Marvel bullpen who contributed to metal head's development, ""Wired"" which provides us background on the physical effects/visual effects of the film. ""hall of Armor"" takes us into the development of the ""suits"".<br /><br />Director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters. It may lack the darkness of ""The Dark Knight"" (ironic considering that ""Iron Man"" is really Marvel's version of ""Batman"" except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the ""Spider-Man"" films directed by Sam Raimi.<br /><br />The nice thing about ""Iron Man"" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book).<br /><br />Marvel's first in-house production ""Iron Man"" demonstrates that the comic book company turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins. Just a reminder--after the credits roll DON'T turn off your TV or BD player. There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third ""Iron Man"" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of ""The Incredible Hulk"".<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 9/30/08 FYI, if  you are having problems playing your disc select ""No"" if a menu comes up asking if you want to turn on BD Live or change the options in your settings for your PS3.

This could easily be one of my favourite Marvel Comics movies, better even than Spiderman or X-Men (forget Daredevil or Electra or Punisher or Ghost Rider).  Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect casting choice, a la Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  Marvel movies are usually well casted anyway, with the exception of Toby Maguire as Spiderman (he's popular, but I'm of the opinion that James Franco would have been better as the image of Peter Parker from the comics) and Ben Affleck as Daredevil.  Jon Favreau, the brilliant writer of Swingers, clearly has as much fun with the character as Sam Raimi has with Spiderman, and Tony Stark is very well fleshed-out and real.  Comparisons would abound with Batman - both were born rich, have reputations as playboys, lost their parents, head giant corporations, have no super powers of their own but are good at stocking up on useful gadgets -  but this film is better than any of the Batman flicks for my money (keeping in mind I haven't seen the latest one).  Great background story of how Stark became Iron Man, and also a fantastic technology sequence where Stark is perfecting his machine.  The battle at the end is not bad, although not as cool as the fight scenes in Matrix 2, and the movie has the best ending/closing line of any movie in recent memory.

Robert Downey Jr. plays the Ironman, a gifted scientist who inherits his father's weapons making corporation only to learn that it is time to grow up and take a responsibility for the damage that weapons can do not just to the rest of the world but also to the americans themselves.  He is indulgent, overconfident, rich but stilll likable.  A kind of a bad boy only Downey Jr. can profile.  Several comic parts are so memorable because Downey Jr. is such a gifted actor that no matter how much bad press he can get about his personal conduct in his personal life we still love him, adore his talent and those dark piercing eyes of his.

Simplistic, similar messages for all, but separated works by the means and methods of the execution.  Downey is a bit clownish and never really a convincing character in his minimal dialogue, slapstickish role - starts and ends as a 2-D fellow.  Not sure what Palthrow's issue and direction were but who cares,  Jeff Bridges came off solid and believable as the egomaniac come of age.  Storyline and plot are chop shopish at best and connected only by the action.<br />Overall, entertaining 2hours worthy of three stars and a rental.

4027768,B001I1NGHY, A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,4.0, Eccentric Machine Humor,"""Iron Man"" entertains exceedingly well thanks to the jovial performance of Robert Downey Jr.  While his song ""Your Move"" from the 4-year old CD <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00064AFK0"">The Futurist</a> is just now in my personal top ten sounding like a new record from Yes, I picked up a copy of ""Iron Man"" for my rainy day video shelf.  Downey was nominated for an Oscar in 1992 for ""Chaplin"" and for a Golden Globe in 2000 for TV's ""Ally McBeal.""  As weapons dealer Tony Stark, he moves from the hard-nosed wheeler dealer to a man with a conscience.  I understood why Jeff Bridges' character Obadiah Stane would want to remove him after he has a conscience, but wasn't altogether clear why he wanted to get rid of Tony when he was a money maker.  Perhaps it was jealousy.  The great humor that Downey brings to the role, particularly with his eccentric machine that keeps wanting to spray him to put out fires, makes the action all the better.  There is also a hint of romance with Pepper Potts played by Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow for 1998's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JGOH"">Shakespeare in Love</a>.  Terrence Howard has been a favorite actor of mine since <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A3XY5A"">Crash (Widescreen Edition)</a> and his Oscar-nominated role in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BITUWU"">Hustle & Flow (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Perhaps one of the best parts is played by Shaun Toub who shined in the Oscar winning ""Crash"" as the Iranian store clerk.  In captivity, Stark meets Toub's Yinsen who becomes his assistant and sacrifices himself for Tony.  Faran Tahir as the rebel leader Raza is excellent.  John Favreau who is currently acting in ""Four Christmases"" directs the film and keeps the pace breakneck.  This is a great action/special effects picture.  Enjoy!",Iron Man

The film's soundtrack is also notable, full of electric guitar sound mixed with orchestrated stuff and it sounds great and fits the movie really well. The few action scenes in the movie are really cool, and although the final battle is a little underwhelming, the rest is really fun to watch. There are a lot of great, memorable lines and scenes throughout the movie too, my favorite part is probably when he blows up the tank, man that makes me laugh so hard.

(Some Spoilers)","After sitting through some rather lackluster Marvel adaptations, such as the overrated ""Spider-man"" and ""X-Men"" films, I sat to watch ""Iron Man"" with cautious optimism. And it proved to be worthwhile. This is, without a doubt, the best adaptation of a Marvel comic book character to date. Dispensing with over-serious storylines, such as in ""Spider-man 2"" and ""The Hulk,"" the story never takes itself too seriously, bringing the fun and excitement back to the superhero movie. The storytelling, visual effects and action sequence all deliver.<br />And the performances? What can I say? Robert Downey, Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark, the playboy/weapons seller turned superhero. His performance is truly believable and clever, and gives this superhero movie its heart. The supporting cast, including Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, plus a cameo appearance by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, add to the film's richness.

4027779,B001I1NGHY, A31U9LIPCE14TE,4.0," Great movie, somewhat less so on the political message","Robert Downey Jr. makes the movie for sure - he plays his character to a ""T"".  There is a reasonable amount of Iron Man action, but much of the movie seems to be setting up the sequel.  I agree with one reviewer's comments regarding the not-so-subtle political message in the film that powerful people in the business of making weapons delight in conflict and will create conflict if none exist to maximize their profits and power (""evil war mongering capitalists"" versus patriots with a desire for freedom to triumph over tyranny).  Contrasted with Batman, The Dark Knight, in my opinion a better (albeit disturbing) movie - the notion of inherent evil is recognized as a force to be battled with unyielding courage, strength, and ingenuity.<br /><br />Tony Stark is confronted with the fact that that up close - war is a dirty business and when advanced weapons fall into the hands of ruthless people with a lust to control others - harm will come to innocents.  In his subsequent conversion to a less capitalistic humanitarian - eschewing the advancement of weapons to wage war and the profits that follow - he manages in a twist of irony to invent a weapon more deadly then anything he's ever created.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good film - good cinematography, special effect, action, acting, and story.  On the down-side: as a family movie, I would have preferred that the gratuitous sex scene was implied vs. demonstrated (I realize it was relevant to develop Tony's character);  a fairly large portion of the action was Tony perfecting his suit vs. battling villains; and, I would have preferred a less trite portrayal of the defense industry and scientists.<br /><br />Hopefully, the sequel will get down to the business of heroic action battling evil.",Iron Man

They didn't mess too much with the costume, it didn't take itself waaaay too serious and it stayed fairly faithful to the source material. Plus we got that real cool set up for the Avengers. When I saw the movie in the theatre all the fanboys went nuts for that little bit at the end of the credits, and I was impressed too. I wish I had thought of it. Downey Jr. is great as Stark (unlike Christian Bale with that silly diguised voice.) It shows that you can stay pretty faithful to the source material and still make a good film. It pleased the fans AND the general audience, AND it really was Iron man. Not a guy in an armored batsuit who usually has the intellect of Sherlock Holmes but (in this movie version) gets others to do his thinking for him. Oh right.... that was another summer film.

4027804,B001I1NGHY, A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,4.0, A cool DVD...but if you want 5-stars...go for the two-disc or Blu-ray version!,"I've been a big fan of the Iron Man comic book series for such a long time and from the ""Tales of Suspense"" comic books, as a young child, I would always be into the ""Avengers"" and even be this happy child with his ""Secret Wars"" Iron Man toy.<br /><br />Years before ""IRON MAN"" became a movie, I've always pictured Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.  He had the look and even back then with Downey Jr.'s personal life, there is some instances that mirror Tony Stark's challenges in the comic books.  So, suffice to say that I was quite happy with him being cast for the film.<br /><br />As for the the film, I had no doubt in my mind that ""IRON MAN"" would be a blockbuster hit in the Summer but I purposely waited for it to come out on DVD, so I can watch it on my own personal home theater and watch it with no distractions.<br /><br />This film focuses on Tony Stark, the millionaire who runs Stark Industries which creates weapons for the military but while on a meeting to the Middle East, Stark's military escort are gun down and eventually the suave millionaire gets caught in a blast (from weapons created by his company), next thing you know, Stark is being operated on and being held by prisoner by terrorists.<br /><br />While under captivity, Stark creates his first Iron Man uniform and uses it to escape his captors.  Upon returning back to America, Stark's perspective of the world and his company has changed.  Also, his goal to develop a more technologically advanced mobile suit armor becomes his obsession and leads him to take on the terrorist who have been using his companies weapons for evil but most of all prepare for the lies and deceptions that await him.<br /><br />AUDIO & VIDEO:<br /><br />The version that I am reviewing is the regular widescreen DVD, not the awesome Blu-ray version packed with a lot of extras.  But the audio for this version is Dolby Digital 5.1 and video is widescreen enhanced for 16:9 TV's.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This ""IRON MAN"" DVD version features deleted and extended scenes.  Deleted scenes that I'm glad the director chose to eliminate from the final cut of the film.<br /><br />There are three versions of this release on DVD/Blu-Ray.  This version is the single disc version, the double disc version features many featurettes including a 108-minute documentary, a six part documentary and more.  The Blu-ray version has received almost perfect stars for its amount of content and BD-Live.  So, if you have a Blu-ray player, the Blu-ray version of ""IRON MAN"" is what is recommended.<br /><br />After watching it, I definitely enjoyed the film but like any superhero film, as the first film always focuses on the origin, this series will be judged on its continuing storylines.  Similar to like the ""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"" and the ""Fantastic Four"" films, there is always the ""origin"" that not many people are too enthusiastic about and want to see more battles.<br /><br />Fortunately, ""Iron Man""did offer quite a bit of kick as battles but I loved the scene where Iron Man just rescues a village being terrorized by the enemies.<br /><br />Again, Robert Downey Jr. did a great job as Tony Star, Jeff Bridges as Obidiah Stane was pretty good.  As for Terrence Howard's James Rhodes... it was OK but I was expecting more of a no-nonsense Rhodes.  But with Don Cheadle replacing Howard for the next film, I hope that Cheadle can bring the attitude especially if he's going to be War Machine.<br /><br />But definitely enjoyed this film.  With ""IRON MAN"", unlike any other top tier Marvel superheroes, Robert Downey Jr. has a lot of inner demons to contend with and is such a complex character.  For the comic series, the alcoholism consumed him and I'm curious to see if it happens in the films.  It will definitely be interesting to see how his character is explored and what new Iron Man outfit we will see him sporting next Silver Centurion Iron Man?  Maybe even see some Hulkbuster or Thorbuster?  Who knows.  And of course, there is James Rhodes as War Machine and I look forward in seeing that character come to play in the films.<br /><br />But all in all, ""IRON MAN"" was an enjoyable film for the first version.  A lot of action, special effects but definitely would like to see where they go with the characters in the next upcoming film.<br /><br />All in all, a very cool movie and enjoyed it so much, now I'm going to have to pick up the Blu-ray ultimate edition next!",Iron Man

4027813,B001I1NGHY, A1DSNDU1A7CIXG,5.0, Iron Man saves superhero movies,"Even as recent as 2006, the super hero sub genre of film had been losing steam. X-men 3 ended up being a joke. Superman Returns was 40 minutes too long and ended up making him a confused and ineffectual moron with a school boy crush that has an illegitimate son. The Fantastic Four movies were too juvenile to be taken seriously and the lord of the new superhero generation, Spiderman, became a jazzy, emotional clown in Spiderman 3.<br /> Longtime and loyal fans were very upset and the uninitiated millions who did not keep up with comics were simply unimpressed. The start of 2008 brought uncertainty for future of these films. The first bastion of hope came in the form of a film adaptation of a rather unknown superhero. Ironman was the story of weapons developer Tony Stark who after receiving a near fatal wound in his chest, creates a super powered suit of armor that allows him to fly and shoot lasers. The teaser trailer to Ironman created a tremendous amount of buzz. Longtime fans were more than excited. They seemed to be almost transformed by the divine touch. Casual movie goers seemed also excited and wanted to finally learn of this strange unpopular character. But as is the usual order of the industry, a good trailer does not ensure a good movie. Some people were skeptical, others hopeful of the movies success and impact. By May of that year everyone got their answer. Ironman opened to world wide acclaim and critical praise.<br /> The movie was a qualified success and gave fans a new hero to rally behind. Unlike earlier efforts by film makers, Ironman delivered its origin story with a healthy sense of character logic and maturity. Gone was the eye winking kitsch and glitz of the past superhero fair. Teenage angst was replaced with middle aged angst and Robert Downey delivered a very confident and nuanced character even before he strapped on the armor. This incredibly kinetic and impossibly agile character was getting down and dirty in warzones that seemed straight out of CNN. This was a different superhero that was facing challenges of our modern world. Considering the current geo-political climate of our time, Ironman was a living breathing sensationalized pop hero critique for our times. The character was a faceless power fantasy vehicle that allowed the viewer to become Ironman and sort of work out their own resolute in a world that doesn't seem to pay attention to the common man. ""What would I do with a super powered suit of armor?"" Blow up terrorists apparently seemed to be the answer given and audiences loved it.<br /> Unfortunately, the movie degrades from its originally laid out premise of a socially conscious superhero and reverts back to a formulaic climatic battle between Ironman and a ""bigger Ironman"" as Stark's armor becomes reverse engineered by his closest business ally. This is sort of where Ironman becomes less perfect as it goes for the cheap thrill ending of a battle between two titans which is how most of these movies seem to end anyway. The movie shies away from Ironman really solving this problem as he was so set on bringing an end to terrorism in the first place. Of course it is only the first movie and it ain't comics without a big ol' robot rumble.<br /> Luckily this movie was a great primer for casual fans and had some of the biggest fan service of any of the superhero movies. This movie had tremendous respect for the source material and any changes made in the movie really helped the story along without putting off the fans. If anything, it improved the Ironman premise for this era.<br /> The DVD package is impressive too with a really good amount of behind the scenes extras to keep geeks enamored for hours. A truly special film and DVD that deserves a place in any library.",Iron Man
4027814,B001I1NGHY, A3GGMEIPLF2QSF,5.0, Iron Man - The Awesomeness Never Stops!,"I can really think of only one word to use to review this movie. Awesome! I'm not a big comic book follower, nor am I a super hero geek so I was little worried going into Iron Man that I was going to be left feeling a little out of the loop. There has also been a boatload of press so I was also a little worried that the movie wouldn't live up to all the hype. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Iron Man ends up being a 126 minute action packed masterpiece that once it winds up is like the Energizer bunny, it just keeps going and going. The film starts with the introduction to fast talking, suave billionaire Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) who is in Afghanistan to show off his company's latest piece of military hardware to the United States Army. En route back from the presentation his convey is ambushed by insurgent rebels and he is taken prisoner. His captors make a deal with him, build them his new missile system and they will give him his freedom. So Tony Stark does what any smart alec, fashionably hip genius would do... build a freaking awesome, super human, punch your guts out robot suit to aide in his escape. Once back on home soil he finds he has a new purpose in life and uses his weapons and inventive genius to target and torment those who are using his weapons for their evil gain.<br /><br />The plot is fairly cookie cutter and you won't be surprised be any of the twists and turns but that doesn't really detract from the movie. The non stop action doesn't give it a chance to. Once Stark's chest mounted arc reactor is powered up the movie blasts off and you're on the edge of your seat for the ride. Love, allegiance, and morals aren't even enough to stop Iron Man from rocketing from zero to awesome. Sure, they are all mixed into the story but sprinkled in just the right amounts so they don't weigh the story down and turn it into a preachy political mess.<br /><br />I wouldn't normally refer to a movie as a must see, but if you enjoy action then this one is for you. The acting is fantastic (especially Robert Downey Jr), the action thrill ride punches you square in the chest (hopefully not in your arc reactor), and the entire film just drips with style. I say it's an 8 of 10 and a must see, especially on Blu-ray!",Iron Man

4027816,B001I1NGHY, A2EH5FDLCMVQL,5.0, Extras Are As Awesome As The Movie,"When I first saw Iron Man in the theaters, it was easily one of my favorite movies. It was definitely my favorite Super Hero movie. I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out so I could see if that feeling remained. Not only did it confirm my initial opinion, but the extras on this DVD gave me a better appreciation of what Jon Favreau did to keep the story of Iron Man as close to the comic book as possible. Robert Downey Jr. was awesome and to see what went behind his performance made me appreciate it more. Now, granted I am a visual effects guy so I am into seeing all of those types of extras. But I think the average Joe will enjoy them as well. I just can't believe how much extra content they were able to squeeze into this package.<br />I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to either see Iron Man for the first time or if you are trying to decide between the single disc edition or this one. Spend the few extra bucks for this one. You will be glad you did.",Iron Man

This means over the years I've tossed Beta VCR's, Windows ME and now my HD-DVD player. HD-DVD was great, it had it all, stunning picture and phenomenal sound. But I have to hand it to Sony (who after dropping the Beta format, I haven't bought anything with the Sony brand since, and my Blu-Ray player is a Panasonic brand) got it right with the Blu-Ray format. Not only is the sound and picture crystal clear but somehow it is actually sharper that HD-DVD. My Blu-Ray player is connected to a Samsung 720 DLP, but I've seen both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD connected to the same a Samsung 46"" 1080p LCD and Blu-Ray literally blows HD-DVD away.<br />Again, the movie is fantastic, but if you want the true theater experience, you have to watch it in Blu-Ray with at least 5.1 digital surround sound.",Iron Man

4027828,B001I1NGHY, A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z,5.0, Superb Ironman Discs,"I was totally over the moon with the set. The first I hear of this movie was an internet promo with the very cleaned up audio from BLACK SABBATH's song the same title, and  some basic visuals. And so, I waited until the film came along, but due to circumstances beyond my control I could not get to the theatre to see it, and wow did I want to see it in the Cinema.<br />Anyways, the film is just totally fiery from start to surprise finish. After reading Ironman in the 70s, he has appeared as everything I wanted. The re-writes in recent years will no doubt try to cheat me of that from what I can gather, but this is something that a long term fan can really get into.<br />The DVD even has some really cool, IPOD style interfaces. The Computers that Stark uses are just ultra cool, and the virtual generation gear is amazing.<br />For the first time ever, I totally agree with all the deletes they made on the movie. This one has no commentary, unfortunately, and I think that they could have done one quite easily for total entertainment value.The Ironman Suits from the basic, made from Necessity, to the ones done through Technology, all have the iconic Ironman Appeal.This is one DVD where only the double set will suffice. The extras tell the story that the commentary does not.John Favreau has crafted another piece together with a team of people who each do their own superb thing. It was also great to see a bit of video of Stan Winston, even though it was his studio and not him, himself who did the work. The Cover is very cool too, since the outer cardboard image comes off to reveal the man underneath, truly a well thought out package.",Iron Man

Robert Downey, Jr. has great comedic timing and sense of sarcasm, yet you also see him develop a sensitivity towards what is really being done with the weapons his character develops.  Jon Favreau has outdone himself, and Jeff Bridges is perfect for Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger.  You've never really seen him as a villain, so this is an interesting turn for him.

4027845,B001I1NGHY, APOUYO1BEPK22,5.0," No he hasnt lost his mind, and yes, he can see... he is not blind","A little worried about Iron Man being just another so-so Marvel movie, such as Fantastic Four? Well don't be. Actually you can stop reading my review now if you want and get up and go watch this movie.<br /><br />If you're still here (oh ye of little faith), then I'll try and help you with that tendril of doubt still holding you to your computer chair preventing you to get up and spend the 300 dollars it costs to go see a movie now. 600 if you are taking a date.<br /><br />Let me first start off with Rob Downey. I for one was hesitant with him being the man who is playing Tony Stark (Iron Man). I rolled my eyes the first time I saw his name a year or so ago when I found out about this movie being made. Even when I saw the first pics for it. But let me tell you right now... the man IS Tony Stark. He's got this role down. I haven't seen this good of a Downey movie since `Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' and `Wonder Boys'. At first I thought he was a total jerk at the beginning, but then realized it's just his way of being funny, and it's absolutely fantastic. Through the whole movie Rob will have you laughing quite a bit. He's not only funny, but he's also quite laid back with his genius. He doesn't bash your face in with how smart he is. To show you how smart he is the film shows a bunch of scientists trying to create something that just isn't possible with today's technology. Though Tony Stark was able to do it an Afghan Cave with spare parts from junk.<br /><br />The film is about Tony Stark. The son of Howard Stark, also a genius. Tony inherits the company from his father when his father dies. He's basically partners with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges who also played the part brilliantly). Stark Industries is known for producing military weapons that, according to Tony, needs to be used only once to end a war. Tony soon finds himself captive of an Afghan rebel group that want his weapons made for them, because whoever owns his weapons, basically wins the war. Tony creates the classic Iron Man suit to get out of the captives hands and once he does, Tony decides he doesn't want to create weapons anymore. He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it. The rest of the owners of Stark Industries isn't to happy with this and they decide to, basically, just not listen to Tony anymore (can't think of the word for this... sorry). While Tony's company is basically doing whatever they want, Tony is in his mansion revamping his original build of his suit. Not to ruin anything about the story (I promise I haven't ruined anything yet, I told you mostly what you can see in the trailers), lets just say Tony is about to put his new suit into some good usage.<br /><br />The special effects were used just right. I honestly didn't think they would be able to make Iron Man look that cool or move that cool. Well let me just say, have no fear, because he rocks. From the classic Iron Man suit to the new. The old Iron Man walks just like you think he should, a bulky machine. The new, well, lets just say you would almost not think he's wearing a suit it's so human like, but just enough machine movement to know it's not completely fake looking. I don't know how to explain it, but it looked great.<br /><br />Also the action scenes were great. I think one of the biggest reasons why they were so good is that they were used sparingly. The movie isn't action packed but has just enough to not tick you off that there wasn't enough and also not to many to over do it. It was just right. Which in turn helps the story out, because it helped give us that character development that a lot of people complain about in these Marvel movies.<br /><br />One last thing I want to say about the actual movie is that Gwyneth Paltrow wasn't bad. I'm someone who really isn't fond of her acting. But she plays Pepper Potts, Tony's `assistant/butler... whatever', and she did a really good job. Paltrow in a supporting role, instead of a lead, is a much better combination, in my opinion.<br /><br />In the end, I think everyone will enjoy this movie. Go take a second loan out so you can pay for gas, movie tickets, and popcorn and coke (maybe some twizzlers if you go donate some blood first) and enjoy a day at the movies! Make sure you stay past the 10 minute credits to see the special ending.<br /><br />P.S. When you see Iron Man fighting, imagine him being 2 or 3 stories tall. Just imagine it. Now picture him with an Autobot or Decepticon emblem on his chest. Now watch him fight. See how cool it is to actually see what the heck is going on during his fight scenes? Maybe in Transformers 2, Bay will be able to put a coherent fight scene together that the viewers can actually tell what is going on instead of watching a bunch of polygons mish mashing together.",Iron Man
4027846,B001I1NGHY, A34D4KCP94ACJZ,4.0, Entertaining and Surprisingly Compelling Action Film,"Jon Favreau (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006ADFY"">Swingers </a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE"">Elf</a>) effectively directs the screen adaptation for the comic book superhero Iron Man.  Favreau has some fine-tuning ahead of him in terms of directing action films but Iron Man is still among the very best comic book character based films so far.  It is about as entertaining as you can get and the few flaws that are present are almost entirely forgivable due to Favreau's knack for developing characters and also understating drama effectively.  It might be important to note that it is hard to contain myself and write an honest review, because in all of my years of reading comics, Iron Man, along with perhaps the Silver Surfer, is my favorite comic book character of them all.  Fortunately for me, unlike last year's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMPW"">Fantastic Four sequel</a>, this particular film truly delivers in terms of satisfying the little long lost comic book geek-boy dwelling in my brain.  There were actually moments during the film that I looked over to my brother in full wide-eyed geek-mode and said things like ""that stands for S.H.I.E.L.D.!""  The kid in me absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />Iron Man, for the uninitiated, is really Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), Chief Executive Officer of weapons manufacturing giant Stark Industries (think Lockheed Martin run by Donald Trump).  He is an arrogant womanizing alcoholic who just happens to be an MIT graduate and a technical genius unlike no other man of his time.  It is as if Leonardo Da Vinci was sent into a time machine, given a mansion, several bottles Johnny Walker Blue, and no reason not to celebrate his lust for women.  In other words, this is not Superman.  Stark is flawed and Favreau so graciously provides us an opportunity to watch him grow as a man and as a machine in his ever-evolving nearly indestructible self-made super armor.  In the beginning, Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and unbeknownst to his enemies, he is shown the error of his ways as a weapons manufacturer and begins building his suit as a way to escape his kidnappers.  A new man with new motives, Stark develops his suit further and becomes an unlikely but befitting hero.  Look out terrorists and look weapons manufacturers, including you Iron Monger!  I only wish he could've cleaned up that ugliness in Iraq on his way home.<br /><br />One can tell by the promotions that the special effects are great and they are amazing from beginning to end.  However, the screenplay is very solid, especially the humorous, fast, and witty dialogue for Robert Downey, Jr.  The chemistry between Stark and his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) works remarkably well and far better than I would've expected.  Jeff Bridges is also great as the villain Obidiah Stane and the rest of the cast is solid all around, with the exception of perhaps Terrence Howard he unfortunately seems to be going through the motions here.  But overall, the magic of this film is the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead role.  He is perfect for the role in almost every way.  Somehow he gives us a hero we feel compelled to find a reason to root for despite his flaws.  I'm not sure another actor could've pulled it off.<br /><br />This definitely receives a high recommendation from me for pretty much anyone looking for a fun and compelling action movie.  For fellow lovers of the Iron Man comics and other crossover stories (i.e. Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D.); do yourself a favor and stay until the credits are done rolling, you won't regret it.",Iron Man

4027848,B001I1NGHY, AU61CID785ACB,5.0, Fantastic! (SPOILERS INCLUDED),"Wow, what a ride! Iron Man is a blast from beginning to end. I'll give a brief plot description for anyone who is not familiar with the comic book:<br /><br />WARNING: SPOILERS<br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.)  is an American arms dealer who is fabulously wealthy and lives the high life. Girls, booze, parties, he does it all. Standing by his side and cleaning up his various messes is his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Whispering dark thoughts in his ear is his partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who you know from the beginning is just not okay.<br /><br />Tony goes to Afghanistan to demonstrate Stark Industries' new weapon, the Jericho missile. His convoy is attacked, his American soldier escorts are killed, and he is seriously wounded by shrapnel from one of his very own bombs. He passes out and wakes up as a captive in a Taliban-like camp. His captors want him to make them a Jericho missile, and he is horrified to see that they have a huge stockpile of Stark weapons. How did they acquire them?<br /><br />With the help of surgeon & fellow captive Dr. Yinsen, Stark makes his first Iron Man suit instead of making the Jericho missile. Using the suit he escapes and creates a big scene that attracts the attention of the U.S. military. He is rescued by the Air Force and returns home. During Stark's escape, the first Iron Man suit is all but destroyed.<br /><br />Back in the States, Stark builds a sharp new Iron Man suit, and goes back to Afghanistan to rescue Dr. Yinsen's village from the terrorist group that had captured him. The military can't figure out what Stark is, so two F-22 Raptors are called to intercept him. He inadvertently damages one of the planes but saves the pilot. Stark then confesses to his Air Force buddy LC James Rhodes (Terence Howard) that he was the cause of the accident. In addition to playing with his new toy and messing with the military, Stark is also determined to find out why the ""bad guys"" have so many of his company's weapons.<br /><br />He unravels the mystery with the help of Pepper Potts and decides he needs to change the mission of Stark Industries. His partner, Obadiah Stane is not pleased and comes up with a suit of his own; he becomes ""Iron Monger."" You can guess what happens, but suffice it to say the final battle scene between them is everything it should be.<br /><br />My husband dragged me to see this movie, and I ended up absolutely loving it. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as always; he is one of those actors that your eye is naturally drawn to while he's on screen. The rest of the cast is very good in support of him. The score is fantastic too (I have already downloaded both ""Merchant of Death"" and ""Driving With the Top Down"" into my iPod).<br /><br />Remember: Tony Stark is a grown-up superhero and this is a grown-up action movie. A good bit of it  takes place in a war zone, and there is plenty of violence and some torture. Of course it is necessary to the plot, but you should be aware that this may not be the best movie for small children.<br /><br />Bottom line: Iron Man is a blast of a movie that manages to touch on some real issues we are facing today, but never becomes preachy about it. LOTS of fun, a rollercoaster ride, a rocking action movie with a sense of humor. Loved it, and can't wait til the DVD is released!!",Iron Man

4027850,B001I1NGHY, A10HMPPHWI3V0A,5.0, Marvel-ous!,"Perfectly cast and executed tremendously with laid back ease, ""Iron Man"" is proof that Marvel still has what it takes to dish out the good stuff. I have to admit that I was starting to worry about the future of Marvel's films after seeing the pathetic ""Spider-Man 3"", ""Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer"", ""Ghost Rider"" & ""Elektra"", but ""Iron Man"" has put life into a franchise that has seemingly been going downhill, ... quality wise that is.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. has done something with his Superhero that other actors have yet to try with theirs, ... loosen up, have fun and add some humor. The screenplay does a wonderful job of adding issues that American's fear at this particular point in time, using the war on terror to make the film more realistic and envolving. Also, Jeff Bridges really does break out in the second half of the film to create quite a villianous character.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",Iron Man
4027851,B001I1NGHY, A38UHOCEKSUOSP,4.0," [4.5] Not just a good superhero movie, but a good movie, period.","Man, this thing has been advertised like crazy - I've seen way too many commercials, trailers, action figures, and news all over the net.  Robert Downey Jr. and director Jon Favreu have been more than confident they have a winner in Iron Man.  With the amount of hype I think I got burnout and I wasn't that interested in seeing Iron Man afterall.  Everyone I talked to loved it so I figured why not.  Turns out everyone was correct and you can believe the hype folks - this is one great film, and sure enough one of the best of 2008 already.<br /><br />This isn't your typical superhero movie, its better than that.  For the most part I didn't feel like I was sitting through a typical superhero film.  There is almost a realistic feel throughout this film unlike some superhero films (but don't expect things to be believable sometimes).  Details are laid out on how everything is built and works.  There is a definite maturity within the storyline and actors.  In fact, the top four actors in the film have all had some big awards in their past.<br /><br />There are two parts of Iron Man.  First you've got the Afghanistan storyline and the Obadiah Stane story (Jeff Bridges) who turns out to be the movie bad guy (and gives Iron Man one heck of a fight in the end).  The creators have done away with the outdated evets on how Iron Man came to be in the comic books, and placed the film in a touchy present day situation, placing Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) as a captive within Afghanistan.  This has a huge impact on Stark's life and the man he will become throughout the film (not just the superhero he becomes, but the person he becomes too).  Obadiah doesn't like it and next thing you know we got quite a villain to deal with.<br /><br />The visual effetcs were provided by Industrial Light & Magic and the sound by Skywalker Sound, in other words you can expect incredible effects that don't dissapoint.  Accompany that with great comic relief, great actors and characters, and an impressive story and you got one film you can't miss out on.<br /><br />And as a bonus, this is just the beginning.  Iron Man 2 is already in works.  Though I missed it in the theatre, a glimpse of Captain America' shield can be seen in Tony's lab.  And don't forget to watch the new Hulk film this June (ditch the old one with Eric Bana).  There is to be a Robert Downey Jr. cameo in that film...something is happening with Marvel.  Oh yeah, and don't miss the end of Iron Man, like after credits end.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5",Iron Man
4027852,B001I1NGHY, A3M2WW0PO34B94,5.0, The Best Film of the Summer?,"Marvel Comics, unhappy with the lack of creative control and its share of profits in the films made by other studios based on their characters, recently started their own film division. The first film from this endeavor, ""Iron Man"" starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard, is a lot of fun, and sure to generate a number of sequels based on the huge amount of money made on opening weekend. This is good for Marvel Films because they will need to use some of the profits from this film to offset the inevitable loss for their next film, ""The Incredible Hulk"" starring Edward Norton, Tim Roth and Nick Nolte, due later this summer. Watch the trailer and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />But I digress. ""Iron Man"".<br /><br />Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) is a brilliant man who grew up in his father's shadow, an inventor, Starks Sr. & Jr. both learn they can make any of their ideas a reality Sr. was one of the people who helped build the Atomic bomb, so it probably comes as no surprise that Stark Industries sells weapons; weapons of every size, shape and megaton. When Tony comes of age, he takes over the company from his father's right hand man, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) and the two work together, as a team - Stark handles the inventions, Obadiah handles the business side of things. Stark takes a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, a huge missile and bomb combo designed to level mountain ranges. Driving back, his convoy is attacked and he is taken prisoner. During the attack, Tony is injured and a fellow prisoner fits him with a magnet saving his life. When Tony wakes up, he learns his captors want him to recreate the weapon he just demonstrated, for their use. But he comes up with a better idea and creates a new power supply for the magnet, allowing him to move without a car battery at his side. He then uses a list of equipment procured from his captors to create an iron suit, complete with weapons, to wear and escape captivity. When he returns home, he realizes he can improve the suit, its powers and its abilities. Now that Tony has seen his products create death, mayhem and damage, he wants to do some good in the world. Naturally, Obadiah is a little disappointed to learn of the companies new, less profitable business plan. But Colonel Rhodes (Terence Howard) is happy to see the change is his longtime business associate and friend. And Stark's personal assistant, Pepper Pots (Paltrow) is also a little more attracted to her boss. After a test run of his new, sleeker, more powerful suit, Stark realizes he left some unfinished business behind in Afghanistan. Then, some trouble begins to brew back home.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau (""Elf"", ""Zathura"" and an actor with many credits) combines unconventional casting choices, very good acting, an intelligent screenplay and some kick a** special effects to create an enjoyable movie going experience and a great kick off to the summer season. This is one of those occasions when you can almost anticipate the sequel, when you can't wait for it. Now that they have all of the exposition concerning the creation of the superhero out of the way, the sequel can get down to business and throw us directly into the story, keeping us on the edge of our seats. I am an eternal optimist.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is a lot of fun and more intelligent than you might expect. Robert Downey, Jr. seems like an unconventional choice to play a superhero, and he is, but he is actually the perfect choice for the role of Tony Stark. A rich, highly intelligent industrialist, Tony works hard, spending a lot of time and money coming up with new ideas and inventions, making them work, making his company all the more rich and powerful. But he also plays hard. Living in a fancy, modern house on a hill overlooking the ocean in Malibu, Tony has state of the art everything in his house, allowing him to spend as much time as possible working and playing. He is also a lothario, sleeping with and hitting on as many women as he possibly can. He picks up a reporter in Vegas and the next morning, in his house in Malibu, she is awakened by the house `opening' the curtains to his bedroom, his assistant, Pepper, holding her dry-cleaning. Tony also has an advanced computer system, helping him and allowing him to run with ideas and to continue to develop them. This system allows him to view 3-D holographic depictions of his ideas, removing and adding pieces at will.<br /><br />As we get to know Tony, we realize he lives a secluded life. Allowed to work and play, as he wants, he knows little of the effects of his work on the real world, and leaves the running of his business to Obadiah. When he travels to Afghanistan, his eyes begin to open as he witnesses firsthand what his work actually does, the consequences of his life, and sees a little window through which he can move to start making a positive impact on the world. But this change in his life doesn't please everyone and provides Iron Man with a formidable foe, the Iron Monger.<br /><br />When Stark is taken prisoner in Afghanistan, he uses all of his previous research and designs to build a new and improved power supply to help keep him alive. And he also creates a prototype of Iron Man, allowing his escape from the men who so desperately want him to create a new weapon for them. This is a great illustration of the character's intelligence and cunning, making all of the previous information about him we have been bombarded with seem very real.<br /><br />Downey, Jr. uses his well-known sarcastic attitude and delivery to bring life to Stark's sheltered persona. Because he lives in a cocoon, and has a lot of money, he doesn't realize how the real world works where he lives and plays as he pleases. This same persona also helps the character bring humor to the proceedings and make the story all the more memorable. He proves to be an excellent choice for the role and his career will definitely benefit from the success of this film and it's inevitable sequels.<br /><br />Favreau and his team have created a rich, decadent playground for Stark to live in. His computer system uses advanced holographs and voice commands, he drives the best, fastest cars and his house is run by a computer system that recognizes Tony and Pepper, and addresses them by name. But more importantly, Favreau has assembled a cast that can act, a group of actors more commonly associated with Academy Award nominated and critically praised films. These actors make their characters richer, more interesting, more watchable and more memorable.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Pots and she is, by far, the weakest of the supporting characters. There is a brief hint of an unrequited love between employee and employer, made more overt during a very good scene set at Walt Disney Concert Hall. But Paltrow is wasted in the role. While she does bring a memorable respectability to the role, making it better, her skills weren't needed for Pepper Pots. When she becomes endangered (which is inevitable, face it), she doesn't stand around shrieking, but she doesn't prove to be extremely strong either. And the flirtatious relationship between Tony and Pepper is generally ignored with the exception of the one scene mentioned earlier and a few passing references. Hopefully, this area will be expanded and improved upon in the next installment.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges plays Obadiah Stane, Stark's father's business partner who helps run the company until Tony becomes old enough to take the reins. Tony continues to work with Obadiah, leaving the day to day operations in his hands, freeing him up to work on his creations. Obadiah is a very smart man and makes the company very profitable. Naturally, he feels threatened by Tony's change in attitude and works behind the scenes to ensure the company will remain as profitable as ever. He also steals Tony's plans and begins work on his own version of Iron Man, seeing the potential in such a lethal weapon. Obadiah has spent his adult life selling weapons, becoming rich as a result. So in his mind, lethal is good.<br /><br />Obadiah is a lot more twisted and crooked than I am letting on, but discovering the extent of this is half the fun.<br /><br />Terrence Howard plays Colonel Jim Rhodes, a longtime associate of Tony, who acts as a liaison between Stark and his government contacts. When Stark is taken hostage, Rhodes leads the rescue mission. When Stark becomes Iron Man, Rhodes helps him out in various ways.<br /><br />As you watch the story unfold, you get the sense Howard, like everyone else in the film, is having a fun time. He plays the role with a certain sense of tongue-in-cheek but this quality is played subtlety, which makes the role all the more appealing and real.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is a very good, very enjoyable, fun summer film. The actors have a lot of fun and it translates to the screen. The performances, in combination with a well-written screenplay, great special effects and a believable universe help to make ""Iron Man"" one of the more memorable summer films in many years. I can easily see this character becoming a franchise to challenge ""Spiderman"" in popularity.",Iron Man

It's got the excitement, danger, and the touch of romance that represents the ""good movie"", all with a lead actor that knows what he's doing.<br /><br />But the best part about Iron Man, I observed while watching for the second time, is not even the action or the overall plot of the movie, as phenomenal as they are. For me, there's nothing better in the world than a main character that undergoes genuine change, a character you actually care about through and through! Tony Stark is as well-rounded a character as can be, one moment making you laugh and another bringing tears to your eyes through his self realizations, risks, and of course his banter with his personal assistant, the ""famous"" Pepper Pots.<br /><br />So, in summary, if you want to watch a movie where you actually care about the characters and the plot resolution, Iron Man is your best bet.",Iron Man

4027856,B001I1NGHY, A38S8RD8XOXLVS,5.0, Well-crafted filmmaking. Iron Man is INVINCIBLE.,"Jon Faverau's Iron Man is a fast paced action packed adaptation of the Marvel comics comic book. A solid film that effectively balances fantasy in a realistic world, Faverau takes the superhero movie to the next level with his fresh, original vision. He crafts a movie that stays true to the comic book roots but looks and feels so realistic I felt like I was watching real feature film about an original character not an adaptation of a 1960's superhero.<br /><br />Iron Man follows the story of Tony Stark the son of a munitions manufacturer who s lived in an ivory tower. Enjoying a life of fast cars, fast money and fast women and hard drinks, Stark could care less about the cost his weapons cause to human life as long as he reaps the profits. His perspective on life changes after a trip to Afghanistan where he becomes a victim of his own weapons. With Shrapnel lodged in his heart, a terrorist group known as the ten rings kidnaps him. They demand he makes a weapon for them. Paired with Yinsen, another kidnap victim, Stark begins work on first the Arc reactor and then an Iron Man to help his escape.<br /><br />Back in the states Stark perfects his armor, not without a few hilarious disasters in the lab. He creates the Mark II silver-plated riveted suit that is far more powerful than the Mark I, but can't go into high altitudes. (Time for a refractory coating.) While designing the Mark III stark creates a gold Titanium Pollyalloy suit (a reference to the golden armor) and paints it red. With the suit perfected, he heads to Afghanistan for a little revenge. (Want to know how Tony flew halfway around the world? He flew all the way up into the Earth's upper atmosphere then flew back down. He did this in the comics to go from L.A. to New York and From L.A to Russia Back in the 1980's. Unfortunately this leads to a run in with some US Jets in thrilling action sequence ripped straight from a Bob Layton panel.<br /><br />The leaders of the Ten Rings find the remains of the Mark I and inform Stane. Stane finds the remains of the Mark I and is eager to get it functioning. He builds his own Iron Monger He confronts stark in his home and takes the arc reactor from his chest. Stark uses his old arc reactor to have an epic battle with Stane taken from an Iron Man Comic- I'm not giving anymore away- THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL.<br /><br />As a longtime fan of Iron Man I'm delighted with this movie. Faverau's movie is a translation of the all my favorite Iron Man comic books to film. Starks house on the coast is just like the one he had in the second David Michilene/Bob Layton run of the book. Mark I looks just like it stepped off the pages of Tales of Suspense #39. The mark II reminds me of the old golden armor and all its flaws The Mark III armor is taken straight from the pages of Adi Granov's Extremis run of Iron Man. Jarvis is just like Homer from the Kaminiski/Hopgood run and the Animated series. There's just so much fanboy goodness in this movie.<br /><br />There is only one word to describe the acting in this film: SUPERB. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. I love the way he plays tony as a cocky, ladies man without a care in the world. Downey's best scenes are with some CGI robots; I love these because he acts just like these robots are people. Jeff Bridges takes his acting to the next level as Obidiah Stane. He steals scenes as the bad guy; it's hard to believe this was the same guy who was in Dumb and Dumber years ago. Terrence Howard is great as Rhodey, his laid-back low key character is a great contrast to tony. Gwyneth Paltrow shines as Pepper Potts. Samuel L. Jackson is a solid Nick Fury.<br /><br />Iron Man is a Shawn James Five Star Essential Movie. Take your Superhero movies to the next level. Get t this along With Batman Begins, The Dark Knight and The Incredible Hulk Director's cut and Superman: The Movie.",Iron Man

4027872,B001I1NGHY, ANCOMAI0I7LVG,5.0," The real man of steel; err, um, iron...","From the moment that `Iron Man' began I knew that this was going to be a fun ride.  My wife and I were talking recently about how the whole concept behind superhero movies has really shifted focus in recent years.  The major studios have realized that more than just teenage boys go to see these movies; and while there are still critical clunkers and high octane action popcorn munching fluff films thrown into the mix; there are also a slew of very intelligent and dramatic superhero films to come out recently.  While `Iron Man' may lack the moral dilemmas that made `The Dark Knight' one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, it definitely earns a spot next to `Spider-Man 2' as one of the most exciting and most watchable superhero movies in recent memory.<br /><br />We can all get on our knees and thank Robert Downey Jr. for that.<br /><br />From the opening scene, where Tony Stark is conversing rather charismatically with soldiers while crossing the desert, Downey Jr. embodied his character with so much natural charm that we were sucked in.  He was funny, he was touching, he was bold, he was confident, he was vulnerable, he was angry; he was all of these things throughout the course of this film, and each emotion was portrayed effortlessly.  He understood each avenue of his characters development and he worked very hard to create a man out of Iron Man.<br /><br />The film starts with a savage attack that leaves Stark in the hands of terrorists that want him to build for them his newly designed superweapon.  Instead, he builds himself a supersuit that enables him to escape with his life.  After witnessing the atrocities that his company has helped create (he builds weapons for war) he decides that he doesn't want his legacy to be mere death but he wants to do something meaningful with his life.  That's when Iron Man is born.<br /><br />The film, much like `Batman Begins' and the first `Spider-Man' film, focuses mostly on Stark's transformation from man to hero.  We see him struggle with his secrets and his plans, not knowing who to trust since everyone who appears to be on his side also appears to be using him for their own gain.  His decision to stop making weapons comes as a blow to the company and to his partner, Obadiah Stane, and it places him on a rocky path with his friend Rhodey, so Stark finds himself secluded and alone as he attempts to create something huge from his very noble idea.  We get to see Stark grow as a person, and thus become a hero on the inside before truly becoming one in the flesh.<br /><br />The performances here are all wonderful, each and every one.  Downey Jr. owns this movie (this was such a great year for him) but he is helped along by a wonderfully talented cast.  First, we have Jeff Bridges.  This man is gold to me, and here he is just brilliant.  Not only is he dashing in every scene (I really want his wardrobe) but he is also engaging and intriguing (and he has the best character arc).  Gwyneth Paltrow is luminous here as well.  She has received lots of good press for this performance, and rightfully so.  She is the typical conflicted best girl to the hero, but she plays it with such fresh spunk.  Terrence Howard is also very good here.  I'm not a usual fan, but he sold me and I'm actually a little upset they are replacing him with Don Cheadle (I am a huge fan of Cheadle by the way) for the sequel.<br /><br />The film is not as `important' as say `The Dark Knight' was.  `The Dark Knight' was a rare gem in the genre, exposing raw humanity within its scope; but Batman is a much different breed of superhero than Iron Man is.  Marvel comics were never as dark as DC, thus the colorful and action filled approach taken to films like `Spider-Man' and `Iron Man'.  Director Jon Favreau (who also co-stars) does a splendid job of making every scene bounce, giving it this vibrant energy that keeps the audience hooked from the very beginning.  This is a truly enjoyable and memorable superhero movie, filled with effortless charisma, engaging action and truly inspired performances.<br /><br />This has been a great year for superheros.",Iron Man

Iron Man saves the day etc. rinse repeat.<br /><br />What makes this 'comic book' movie great and one of the best adaptations of all time is 1 thing.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />I had been a comic book fan since I was a kid, and while I mainly collected Spider-Man, I knew Iron Man and his back story.  I knew him but never really was into him except when the story revolved around Tony Stark and his personal life.  While usually the book is better than the movie, this is one of those rare exceptions where the real life version far exceeds the book.<br /><br />Quite simply, like Heath Ledger as The Joker, you don't see Downey Jr. on the screen but Tony Stark.<br /><br />Yes, he's that good.<br /><br />Whoever casted Downey for this movie deserves a raise or % of the profits because without him the movie doesn't excel.  Yes the CGI is fantastic but the other people cast in the movie don't inspire the audience.  Paltrow is fine, Howard I thought was good (bad move replacing a decent character who wanted to return for the sequel with Don Cheadle as good as he is), Bridges is very good but this movie belongs to Downey Jr.<br /><br />Sometimes a basic script can be made exceptional when you find a definitive actor to play a role.  Not only will this film make comic book fans happy, it is perfect for both genders, all ages, or anyone that likes movies in general.<br /><br />One of the greatest comic book movies of all time and a joy to watch that instantly ranks in the top 5 of said adaptations ever made.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION",Iron Man

4027875,B001I1NGHY, A2R1ZCS1UEVJYD,5.0," Simple, But Amazing","Of all the comic book movies out there, ""Iron Man"" ranks as one of THE best. I was surprised to hear that Jon Favreau was directing it and he couldn't have done a better job. Robert Downey, Jr. IS Tony Stark and Favreau is the only one who could've done the job. ""Iron Man"" not only excels as a great super hero movie, but as a great movie. Even though the plot is predictable and very simple, at the same time it's funny, dramatic, and it's full of heart, and it's all because we have a great story and a perfect cast to play it out. ""Iron Man"" takes a modern approach to the origin of the hero. Instead of 'Nam, Stark has his accident in the middle east, in Afghanistan. We get to see the Ten Rings (who kidnap Stark) and some references are made to Iron Man's arch-nemesis, the Mandarin. I won't go into the story (you'll have to see it!) but I will say the story plays out great, and we have some great acting from Downey, Jr. and Jeff Bridges. Downey definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actor in this one. The special effects are fantastic; the final showdown is a good example. It's amazing how they actually built a functional Iron Man suit to use instead on relying solely on CGI. The action sequences are beautifully orchestrated and there's not too much or too little. There's plenty of laughs and many dramatic moments and again, I can't give the cast enough cred. Plus, for fans of the comics, there an awesome scene at the end of the credits. Now, for the review on the 2-Disc DVD set. This ""Ultimate 2 Disc Set"" delivers the goods. The first disc features the main film in all its glory and the deleted/extended scenes that definitely needed to be cut. The 2nd disc includes a great 7-part ""Making Of"" documentary that goes into great depth at the filmmaking process of Iron Man. There's also a 45 minute documentary about the character's origins in the comics. And then, there's a funny clip from ""The Onion"" and some videos featuring some screen tests, a look at the visual effects, and photo galleries. This DVD set is the one to get and it's worth the money. Overall, ""Iron Man"" is a fantastic film and is a must see and it's worth watching over, and over, and over again!",Iron Man

4027877,B001I1NGHY, A2RHBT46LS6DA3,5.0, THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN!,"2008 has been a banner year for movies from my point of view, and one of the highest points was IRON MAN. There have been a lot of comic-book adaptations in the past few years, and there are a lot more coming. Unlike those seen in past decades, the more recent set of adaptations have been in general good-to-great, with even the worse ones generally reaching at least the level of mediocre-watchable (as opposed to the depths reachable only by abominations such as, say, the Captain America movie made about 15 years ago).<br /><br />Iron Man is at the top of this pretty impressive heap. One of the things it manages to do is keep most of the ORIGINAL Iron Man origin, something I was sure that they would dump or, worse, screw up. While the details were, and had to be, changed (for instance, the original Iron Man started out as a POW in Viet Nam, if I recall correctly), the essence of the origin is the same. Into this they also seamlessly integrate a MOTIVE for carefree playboy Tony Stark's conversion into a hero willing to risk himself personally in battle for other people.<br /><br />Downey's portrayal of Stark is letter-perfect, in some ways possibly even better than Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man/Peter Parker -- which is saying quite a bit, as the first two Spider-Man movies basically set the bar for modern superhero movies, and set it very high. Stark is a patriot, but also a super-wealthy and successful genius who likes playing with his money, entertaining himself with beautiful women (and never committing to them) and basically doesn't bother to think much about the potential dark side of the weapons manufacturing that Stark Industries does best. Despite his apparently worldly ways, Tony Stark is -- actually -- very much an innocent, an adult with the impulses and idealism of a child.<br /><br />And when he discovers how very badly his own creations are being abused, he has the same outraged fury that any young person has when some of their most cherished and fundamental beliefs are shattered.<br /><br />But unlike 99.999% of children, Tony Stark can DO something about it. And after going through a personal hell that shatters and rebuilds him, he decides that he WILL do something about it.<br /><br />And then things start to get ugly.<br /><br />The first movie in a known-character series like this -- Spider-Man, X-Men, etc. -- usually suffers from Origin Syndrome. You have to spend time introducing us to the main character, setting up what they're like, give them their origin, lead them into a problem, and then if you're lucky spend the last forty-five minutes actually doing the superheroing that is (presumably) the draw.<br /><br />Iron Man DOESN'T suffer from this. Partly this is because unlike most of the other superheroes, Iron Man isn't a victim of chance, a fortunate or cursed person who got the right genes, got bitten by the right spider, was gifted by gods at a whim with strange powers beyond those of mortal men. Iron Man is literally a self-made man. He becomes a hero by the power of his own mind and resources; he decides to become a hero because he's seen that a hero is needed, and that decision and the process involved is part of what makes this movie WORK, and work well.<br /><br />Another reason this movie doesn't suffer in the origin sequence is that Tony and his situation are more familiar to us in the real world. He isn't fighting mutants with wierd powers (that have to be explained, just like the hero's), or psychos with a personal issue (that needs to be brought up in detail). He's a familiar figure, a powerful and wealthy man who suddenly finds that his own mighty empire is corrupt, and he needs to fight against THAT. His issues are front page news here, with only slight changes to names. So there is no need to waste much time explaining; we can understand what he is, what his enemies are, and so on. The only thing we DON'T see in this world is..<br /><br />... the Armor. And of course, THAT is the other great star of Iron Man. We have finally reached the point where that amazing super-suit of armor can be believably created on-screen, and it's clear that someone spent a very, very long time trying to MAKE it believable (just one example; when Tony flies with the suit, you can see the suit's general configuration SHIFT with flight direction, speed, etc. -- just as a real flying vehicle has to shift its configuration with flaps, etc. in order to maintain good flight characteristics).<br /><br />Even more interestingly, the movie avoids some of the nastiness and grotesquerie which could easily have been present in some of the sequences, leaving this a movie I don't feel uncomfortable letting my (older) kids watch.<br /><br />I sure hope that the sequel, and currently planned connecting movies, do not disappoint.",Iron Man
4027878,B001I1NGHY, A292163FE9C117,4.0, The Best Superhero Movie So Far!,"I've heard--and read--so many disparaging remarks regarding superhero movies, as if they're somehow inferior to ""real"" movies--what is a REAL movie, anyway? A low-budget indie full of miserable people? I think the characterization in Iron Man, like the Spider-Man franchise, is very good. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark/Iron Man. No one else could have brought this character to life as he has. The supporting cast is excellent. The story is true to the comic book--or is it ""graphic novel"" now? I'm never quite sure! The story never bogs down. The special effects are spectacular. Marvel was wise to take the reins on this one.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars instead of five because I was disappointed to find, in all the extras included in the 2-disc set, there was no BLOOPER REEL!!!!",Iron Man
4027879,B001I1NGHY, A16QODENBJVUI1,5.0, One of the best super hero movies ever made,"Most people on Amazon -- and I count myself among them -- reviewing movies or TV shows primarily review the film or series and not the product.  As a rule, I think this is more helpful than focusing on features, extras, packaging, and such.  Because these change and usually (though not always) Amazon links the old versions to the new, comments about these can become irrelevant.  I am making an exception to this product, the Blu-ray 2-disc edition of IRON MAN, simply because it is the first movie that I bought on Blu-ray.  I previously had bought two TV series on Blu-ray, but this is the first film.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Sony Playstation 3, primarily for watching movies, though secondarily for playing games.  I limiting my Blu-ray purchases until the prices for the discs come down to around the same level as DVDs.  On the other hand, I'm virtually cutting out my purchases of DVDs entirely, since the new format is already on hand.  I wouldn't be surprised if overall DVD sales started to drop if more people follow the kinds of buying patterns I'm currently practicing.  We are in an in between period.  The format war is over and Blu-ray has won, but not enough people own Blu-ray players because they are priced too high.  But just as I stopped purchasing LPs and cassette tapes once CDs were released, so I'm ceasing buying DVDs.  But my purchasing of Blu-ray is minimal.  Mostly I rent from Netflix.<br /><br />Which leads to the question, why buy Blu-ray at all?  Well, only if there is enough in the product to justify it.  In the case of IRON MAN, I believe what you get justifies the cost.  I was a little nervous the first time I put a Blu-ray on, wondering if the difference was going to justify the money I had expended.  I'm delighted to say that it did.  The main feature, of course, looks extraordinary.  But IRON MAN is unique in contrast with the other Blu-ray films and series that I have watched in the format in the amount of extras also in 1080 high-def.  I think this will change quickly as Blu-ray matures as a form, but currently many releases have the main feature in 1080 high def, but many of the features in a lower resolution.<br /><br />IRON MAN also has an amazing number of special features that I actually enjoyed watching.  Too often special features just seem to be filler, put there to make the purchaser that there is more to the item purchased than there is.  And frankly, more often than not I don't bother with special features at all.  But I find projects like IRON MAN to be quite fascinating, since it involves combining several technologies to create the final main character, including the main actor, stunt doubles, high tech suits, robots, and extensive CGI.  Frankly, going behind the scenes of most movies -- even most very good movies -- is not terribly interesting.  But in the case of a high-tech super hero movies, it is very nearly as much fun as the main feature itself.  I especially enjoyed the series of short features documenting the making of the film.  I find that I enjoyed the movies itself more fully on rewatching than I did the first time through.<br /><br />IRON MAN is important not merely for being a very good movie, but for being the first movie by a new studio that is certain to be among the greatest producer of box office smashes in the next decade.  After watching several Marvel characters drive some of the greatest box office hits of the past decade, Marvel has established its own production company.  The goal is ultimately an Avengers movie and to that end they are bringing out a string of movies over the next 3 or 4 years, introducing potential new members of the Marvel answer to the JLA.  We have already been introduced to Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (and I hope everyone who has watched IRON MAN stuck around after the closing credits to be introduced to Nick Fury, who gets his own movie something early in the next decade -- this will almost certain star Samuel L. Jackson, who gave his permission to serve as the model for Fury in The Ultimate Nick Fury comic release).  Marvel has announced movies based on Thor, Captain America, and Ant-Man, all of whom were members of the Avengers in one or another version, along with Iron Man and the Hulk.  Marvel's formula, based on IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK, as well as the movies they are striving to cast (the word is that Daniel Craig recently turned down the offer to star in THOR), is to make a character based film focused primarily on a high-profile actor (Robert Downey Jr., Edward Norton, and if he had taken the offer Daniel Craig), and then build the action around him, instead of having the character as an afterthought to the action.  It has worked wonderfully in the Spider-Man movies (which was primarily a Sony production).  When and if they do an Avengers movie, the cost of the cast alone should be jaw dropping.  However, Marvel isn't focusing on the Avengers alone.  They have also announced their intention to do a film based on my own favorite Marvel series, Brian K. Vaughan's The Runaways, about a group of empowered teens in California who discover that their parents are super villains, causing them to become runaways (hence their name).  Though the Runaways have been tangentially included in Marvel Big Events like the Civil War and the Secret Invasion, they aren't centrally involved in the rest of the Marvel Universe.  There will also be a Silver Surfer film, hopefully with Galactus as his foe.<br /><br />My fear is that Marvel is going to be exclusively focused on producing titanic box office smashes.  Though I will add that both IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK focus on character enough to make both far more than cinematic comic books.<br /><br />My last comment is that as a Robert Downey Jr. admirer, I couldn't be happier that he seems to have conquered his personal demons to enjoy the greatest commercial success of his career.  He is a first rate actor who has been in many, many fine movies over the years, often in independent productions, but for a while it looked like his career might be over.  Although he proudly points out that even during the years when he struggled with drug addiction and never missed a single day of shooting on any film, after his final rehab and jail stint insurers would not insure his films.  I know that Woody Allen had to drop him from one project because they couldn't get insurance for him.  Gradually, however, he managed to work his way back.  He is especially good to see in this role because his own personal problems parallel those of Tony Stark in the comics.  Like Downey earlier in his life, Tony Stark struggles with alcoholism.  The film only shows him drinking.  I wonder if IRON MAN 2, which was just announced, will show Stark dealing with his drinking.  I hope so.  It has been the focus on things like this that have made several of the Marvel movies so enjoyable.  Although there is great action, ultimately they are about believable, very human individuals who become heroes.  The more human you make the characters, the more delightful they become as heroes.",Iron Man
4027880,B001I1NGHY, A2UW83R0JOZZ6,4.0, Iron-Clad Action Movie,"Batman and Spider-Man beware: there's a new hero in town and though he may not have all those ""wonderful toys"" or be able to throw sticky webs, he's packing a serious arsenal.  Born from the imaginations of Stan Lee and Larry Lieber and penciled by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby in 1963, ""Iron Man"" is the second Marvel Comic hero come to life on the big screen this year.  Boasting big names (Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard) and even bigger visual effects to boot (courtesy of the illustrious Industrial Light and Magic), ""Iron Man"" was the box office grand slam of late spring 2008 and upon viewing it's easy to see why.<br /><br />The film doesn't waste much time before it jumps right into the action and gives us a keen character establishment of its main man.  Tony Stark (Downey Jr) is a man made rich off his father's munitions business of Stark Industries and lives rather recklessly as a result, cavorting about the world in private jets and expensive cars, bedding beautiful women and drinking at all hours of the day.  Beneath a seemingly spoiled rich boy exterior lies an astounding brain for engineering, Stark's company reaching new and glorious heights with his brilliant fabrications of innovative and powerful weapons for the US military.  When he travels to Afghanistan for a dramatic unveiling of his new ""Jericho"" missile, his small convoy is ambushed and he is taken prisoner by Afghan radicals.  Rigging his heart to a device that would mean certain death if he dismantled it, they order him to replicate the Jericho missile for their own purposes in exchange for his release.  Knowing he's a dead man no matter whether he accepts or refuses the terms, Tony sets to work on his greatest design yet, something that brings meaning to the saying ""necessity is the mother of invention"".  Breaking free from a desert cave in a colossal suit made of metal, Stark blasts the baddies and returns home to America with a renewed perspective, determined to veer off his long course of war profiteering.<br /><br />Something's afoot however and Stark encounters a curious amount of resistance to his plan from business partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges).  While the fragments of truth slowly piece together, Stark perfects his original design and with the help of his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) keeps the project hush-hush while testing its limitations and using its power to right the many wrongs that Stark Industries has caused.<br /><br />Being a comic book adaptation, you can expect some impressive visual effects from ""Iron Man"" and you get them in spades.  Not only do we see the streamlined red and gold suit in CGI but some of the fun parts are watching Stark piece it together in his vast workshop as well as test its radical capabilities (he gets comically blown into the wall more than once testing its rocket thrusters).  No greater magic can be felt than when a superhero takes flight and there are plenty of heartracing aerial stunts that have Iron Man soaring far and wide through the clouds and the stars, as well as taking treacherous falls from thousands of feet back to Earth.  The mere concept and engineering of the suit will get some mental gears turning, for in this age of rampant and advancing technology one can only wonder whether such a wondrous contraption is conceivable.<br /><br />Downey Jr. is the man of the hour as Tony Stark/Iron Man, the 43-year old actor relishing the extravagant playboy persona of his character and excelling in the dramatic scenes where Stark sees the cause and effect of his profession.  He also made a figurative iron man of himself, sculpting his body with vigorous weight training (five days a week) and martial arts.  He is a literal phoenix of the entertainment industry, risen from the ashes of drug abuse and bad press to come back full swing and win over audiences and jaded film critics once again.<br /><br />Also noteworthy is Bridges as the villanous Obadiah Stane, rendered almost unrecognizable with his bald head and full salt-and-pepper beard.  He takes to his bad guy role quite well and doesn't disappoint in his climactic battle with Stark.<br /><br />Paltrow, a critical darling and a great actress, is an odd choice for the role of Pepper Potts, her stiff performance going right along with her stiff traipsing in all those tight, restrictive skirts and stilettos she wears.  Her scenes with Downey Jr. where they are playfully bantering are engaging but when portraying terror, she falls flat.  Why she was chosen for this role is anyone's guess.  Another waste of talent is Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Stark's close friend and confidante.  Howard can act the hell out of a dramatic role (just watch ""Crash"" and ""Hustle & Flow"" and you'll see what I'm talking about) but nary a hint of his capabilities is revealed here, another headscratcher of a casting choice.<br /><br />Director Jon Favreau (an actor turned director) does an admirable job in the driver's seat with this big-budget feature ($140 million), recouping the cost and them some when the film made over $300 million domestically.  He has already signed on for a sequel, as have Downey Jr. and Paltrow.  It will be interesting to see whether he can be on par with or surpass Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" juggernaut.<br /><br />Bottom line: Be you an action movie fan or a lover of superhero fables, ""Iron Man"" will entertain you in more ways than one with its non-stop action, engaging story and charismatic performance from Robert Downey Jr.",Iron Man

Iron Man is an enjoyable addition to this growing catalog of films, but it could have been truly outstanding with a few additions.<br /><br />The basic story is about a great industrialist who gets out of weapons manufacturing and into costumed heroism, having a change of heart after he spends some time imprisoned by warlords who have been acquiring his company's weapons.  This character turn had the potential to become preachy and obnoxious, but the movie wisely limits the peacenik blabbering to one minor character encountered early in the film.<br /><br />The movie underutilizes its two best assets: Tony Stark, and the suit.  Iron Man's combat suit is quite impressive, is equipped with a wide assortment of weapons, and seems to have enormous potential for elaborate action scenes.  Unfortunately, there is really only one scene in which we see him use the suit to its full capacity.  The film would have benefitted from one more big action sequence at that point in the story, or at least extending the scene we do have.  As for the man inside the suit, the character of Tony Stark is quite entertaining to watch when he's free to exchange verbal barbs with another character, or when he is let loose to adopt the larger-than-life billionaire playboy persona.  However, when he is constrained to trudge through plot-advancing dialogue, or when he has to share a more personal moment with another character, he seems to lose all his charm in an instant.<br /><br />But hey, if my biggest complaint is that I wanted more of a good thing, the movie must be doing alot of things right.  I solidly recommend it.<br /><br />PQ:<br />Blu-Ray picture quality was very good.  The only distracting digital noise I observed was when we see from a point-of-view inside the suit, which was clearly deliberate.  The daytime exterior shots are very nice, showing plenty of detail.  The dark, interior shots are not as impressive, but I've yet to see any movie on Blu-Ray that handled them perfectly.  Overall I would say the picture quality on the Blu-Ray is quite good, similar to (and maybe just a touch better than) Spiderman 3.",Iron Man

It seems he is needed to build a missile for them; the twist being that it is a weapon he himself designed.<br /><br />The only way his heart can be kept beating is by keeping it connected to a crude battery unit. In a terrifically suspenseful sequence, Stark stalls for time so he can build an iron suit capable of protecting him from bullets and explosions while he wipes out his captors.<br /><br />Upon returning to L.A. (in an unlikely rescue), Stark decides to stop developing weapons and live a nobler lifestyle (which is no fun). However, Jeff Bridges (the requisite confidant-turned-archenemy) has other ideas and battles against Stark's newfound idealism while secretly creating his own goliath suit; presumably because all bad guys in these movies crave Ultimate Power.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is the producers' ace-in-the-hole. Without him this would be just another mediocre entry in the long line of cookie-cutter Marvel films. His performance hits you like a shot of pure oxygen. He is the slick, supercool badass with snappy one-liners we all wish we could be. Even when the plot falls apart, Downey's mere presence makes the onscreen nonsense bearable (and, at times, hardly noticeable).<br /><br />The rest of the bland cast isn't worth mentioning. After Stark constructs his true Iron Man suit and the obvious reveal of Jeff Bridges as the villain, there's nowhere left to go except the inevitable showdown. Or so the screenwriters have surmised. The remainder of Iron Man's running time is a tedious, disappointing affair.<br /><br />My personal preference would have been for Stark to simply fight terrorism across the globe without the stale conflict of Jeff Bridges' character (especially because Bridges' dialogue eventually becomes cartoonishly rotten, even for this type of movie). There's a scene where this happens and it's the last time Iron Man provides a refreshing antidote to the typical mundane style of storytelling prevalent in Marvel's blockbuster features.<br /><br />At least the audience can rightfully expect a better sequel from the brave, abrupt surprise ending.",Iron Man
4027892,B001I1NGHY, A3GKMQFL05Z79K,5.0, Iron Man......,"Superhero movies seem to be the rage these days. With movies like Iron Man, I can see why. Not that I'm complaining. If you've read enough of my reviews lately, you'll see I'm quite a big comic book fan myself so it is great news for me. True, I'm an admitted DC fanboy but I, occasionally, get into Marvel Comics as well. Honestly, though, I've never been into Iron Man as much as I have others like Blade, The Punisher, Ghost Rider, Wolverine, Iron Fist and Doctor Strange. You can tell by my favorites there that I'm into the darker, more twisted likes of Marvel's gallery. Yet, after seeing Iron Man, I've decidedly thought about purchasing his comic on a regular basis now. The movie is about Tony Stark. A wealthy industrialist who is kidnapped to build a destructive weapon for the enemy. If things weren't bad enough, shrapnel works its way near his heart and the only thing keeping him alive is a small electromagnetic generator installed in his chest.  Instead of building the weapon for the enemy, he builds a fantastic suit of armor to escape by. After escaping, he decides to turn his life and company around much to the disappointment of Obadiah Stane(his second in command at Stark Industries). Obadiah wants complete control over Stark Industries, even if it means wiping out Tony Stark and that's when things start to get interesting. Without giving too much away, let's just say things get wayyy more interesting from that point.<br /><br />In my honest opinion, Iron Man is Marvel's first movie into more 'serious' material. Not one time in the movie did I find things too unbelievable or fantastical as some of their previous movies led me to feel. Even though I actually loved The Dark Knight and know that some things in that movie could actually happen, this movie made it more believable for me.<br /><br />Directed by Jon Favreau; the film stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges. Extras include:Trailers(Star Trek, Indiana Jones & The Incredible Hulk), Deleted/Extended Scenes, Iron Man: Armored Adventures(which is a preview of the animated Iron Man series that will air next year on Nicktoons), I am Iron Man(which is a documantary of the making of the movie), The Invincible Iron Man(which is a featurette detailing the creation of Iron Man to his present day interpretation), Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man(which is self-explanatory), Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test, The Actor's Process(a four minute rehearsal with Robert Downey Jr, Jeff Bridges and Jon Favreau),  The Onion ""Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into a Full-Length Film(a two and a half minute parody of a news report) and Galleries(Three picture galleries which allow you to see the movie through photos).<br /><br />All in all, Iron Man is a wildly believable and fun ride.",Iron Man

IF YOU WANT INFO ON PICTURE/SOUND AND EXTRAS SKIP TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH PARAGRAPHS.<br /><br />THIS REVIEW IS ON THE TWO DISC SET. THE ONE DISC SET PRIMARILY HAS THE FEATURE FILM<br />THANKS!<br /><br />""Titanium Composite Man"" just doesn't have the same ring to it as ""Iron Man"". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is ""The Merchant of Death"" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.<br /><br />He uses the crude tools to build a suit of metal that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by coming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).<br /><br />The DVD looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. It's one of the top notch transfers  I've seen in recent years. Audio is extremely active and is well used to put you into metal head's world.<br /><br />The extras are stunning as well. We get a full documentary ""I AM Iron Man"" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre-CGI work, design elements to on-the-set wire work involving Robert Downey, Jr. Director Jon Favreau (who also plays Happy in the film)manages to seamlessly combine CGI with pratical physical effects such as puppets and the men in suits. His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa. We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out. There are also stills galleries, screen test, a featurette ""Invincible Iron Man"" that gives us an idea about the development of the character with interviews featuring many of the Marvel bullpen who contributed to metal head's development, ""Wired"" which provides us background on the physical effects/visual effects of the film.<br /><br />Director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters. It may lack the darkness of ""The Dark Knight"" (that ""Iron Man"" is really Marvel's idea of ""Batman"" but a bit of irony thrown in for good measure except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the ""Spider-Man"" films directed by Sam Raimi.<br /><br />The nice thing about ""Iron Man"" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book).<br /><br />Marvel's first in-house production ""Iron Man"" demonstrates that the comic book turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins. Just a reminder--after the credits roll DON'T turn off your TV or DVD player. There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third ""Iron Man"" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of ""The Incredible Hulk"".<br /><br />Highly recommended!",Iron Man

I would definitely go for In-and-Out waaaay before BK, whether or not I'd been in an Afghani cave for 3 months.<br /><br />I've never read the comic book, and never been that much into them anyway. This is definitely not the semi-plausible superhero (Batman) nor is it the completely implausible (X-Men). That leaves the techno-superheroes: Iron Man. I'm not sure which I find more implausible. But I must admit a buff Robert Downey Jr. is better eye candy than Toby McGuire. That, of course, could easily lead to a super-hero comparison via the eye-candy factor.<br /><br />What seemed a bit lurching was the pace of the beginning and end. The beginning is slow, but not unpleasantly ('get to know the cast of characters and understand the hero's tragic flaws'). But it seemed to be rushing towards the end - fast paced action, sure - but this seemed like someone abruptly realized it was already min.120 and counting, and had to hurry to end it.  Sad, because I was still enjoying it.<br /><br />Downey was spectacular as the nascent superhero, developing the new suit. A childish joy immediately squashed by Newtonian physics. Childish, yet thoroughly amusing consequences (several squashed cars).<br /><br />Script?  ok<br />Direction?  ok<br />FX?  good<br />Robert Downey?  totally makes the movie.  He inhabits the part.

There was someone here who mentioned Full Screen. I just wanted to say Yo Dude spend for a better TV, Full screen cuts the original format and you are only seeing part of the film. And this Movie is one where you don't want to miss anything. The increase size is probably for the flying scenes where they need more room to show off the Suits abilities. This movie is Iron Man after all. (no disrespect intended) A great example of what I am talking about would be the difference between the full screen and wide screen versions of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The scene where Indy and his father are driving the motorcycle. You miss so much of the interaction between the two in the Full Screen Version.  But review is about Iron Man so back to the review. The acting was great and Robert Downey Jr looks just like Stark in the comics.  The suit is awesome and the special effects added nicely to the movie to help complement the scenes.

4027905,B001I1NGHY, ASJ8LQ4NBW66Z,5.0, Very impressive,"Rest assured, Iron Man is an absolutely amazing movie. I won't dare spoil any of this remarkable movie for you but I do recommend it as highly as I possibly can. Marvel needed to get in to the solo movie making business long ago. Instead of leasing out their characters to other studios, they're making movies themselves. Most everyone knows Iron Man is their first effort and what a great lead off film! This movie helps take the comic book genre to the highest level. Just like they did in the books, they reinvent standard epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters and making them more believable. The Spider-Man and the X-Men movies did this to a degree but only as far as their respective studios wished to stay true to the source material. Anything added or amended was for the benefit of the live action adaptation. Director Sam Raimi pulled this off by talking to the summer crowd, not down to them with the Spider-Man series. Jon Favreau has done the same thing here but I think he's done it even better. Raimi intentionally threw in a little cheese. Favreau adds nice bits of humor but not too much. He also grounds the action and the suit of armor in firm reality. I've said it before but it's brave to reach for the highest common denominator with a big budget film and Favreau delivers a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. Needless to say, Robert Downey Jr. and company deliver the goods. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.<br /><br />The amazing yet realistic action is paced by the plot and characters that keep you interested from start to finish. What absolutely blew me away were the phenomenal special effects. I know they built a practical, working armor. What I loved is the use of CGI was used to augment the real life armor and not create something from scratch. Most all CGI constructs feel fake somehow but the stuff in Iron Man didn't seem fake even for an instant. As great as everything looked, what really drives the movie is the emotional resonance and down to earth nature of the plot. Sure the concept is wild but it's all presented so that you really believe it could happen. I doubt anyone will find fault with this movie unless they went in trying to dislike it.",Iron Man
4027906,B001I1NGHY, A6UXTSYYWPXR6,5.0, Better Every Time I Watch It,"To quote/paraphrase a line from the movie (no, this gives nothing away); ""my father created weapons in the hope that they would not have to be fired.  I respectfully disagree.  The best weapon is the kind you only have to fire ONCE.""<br /><br />All I had to do was see Iron Man once, and I was utterly hooked on it.  To further my impression of the movie before I plunge into the actual review, I will say this; I have seen the movie IN THEATRES five times.  I paid every single time, and not only that, I plan on buying the special edition disk set.  One hopes that will give you some indication of how good the movie really is for the diehard Marvel fan.<br /><br />I admit, I had my doubts.  It'd been a long time since I'd seen Mr. Downey Jr in a film, and Ms. Paltrow as well, come to think of it.  I've been suffering through renditions of how directors and producers saw Spider-Man, assiduously avoiding The Fantastic Four franchise because I didn't want to see the F4 being mutilated along with the Silver Surfer...but Iron Man completely restored my faith in a director's ability to cut through the ""SPECIAL EFFECTS FIGHT SCENES MAKE THE MOVIE!"" crap that so many directors of today suffer from, most fatally.<br /><br />Mr. Downey Jr BECOMES Tony Stark, brilliant alcoholic multi-millionaire.  He is so believable that when I bring him up in conversation, I don't say ""Mr. Downey Jr was great in that scene,"" I saw ""wow, Tony did really well right there!""  He submerged himself and became, instead of simply acted, his role.  It was beautiful to watch.  It is rare than an actor of Mr. Downey Jr's considerable talent finds a role that suits him so perfectly, that allows him to be so expressive, that makes him truly become one of the best actors of this decade, if not this generation.<br /><br />I could easily wax more eloquent on the abilities of Mr. Downey Jr, but that would defeat the purpose of this review, so I will continue.  Simply put, the plot of this movie and the origins of Iron Man synchronize without rough edges, and the characters are utterly believable humans with human motives and flaws.  The actors and actresses in this movie are flawless and the dialogue is engaging and humorous.  This movie is well worth the money to own, or in my case, to see five times and then proceed to ownership.  Give it a try!  You will not regret it.",Iron Man

Spiderman and Rocky and Superman, they stay too serious from front to back!  While good movies, they not human related, they may be different, but they still are human.<br /><br />Downey shows this in the movie, while trying on the flying equipment, who would expect from previous movies for a flawless flight,  the reaction during that just that ONE scene, left me rolling on the floor.",Iron Man
4027908,B001I1NGHY, A2LKP7H7RZ2Z63,5.0, Awesome movie,"This movie is excellent. The actors were real, and were human about their roles. The change from being snooty Tony Stark to one of a superhero was flawless (unlike other superhero movies where you get a sudden change and their old personality was lost). The humor was great, the CGI felt so realistic (visually, you couldn't tell that it had CGI). The sound and music went great together. The actors didn't speak so quietly that you had to turn the volume way up. This movie is a must have.",Iron Man
4027909,B001I1NGHY, A3KJ6JAZPH382D,5.0, He is Iron Man,"With each decade, the dark heart of Comic Book Adaptations beats a little faster. Ever since Tim Burton made his version of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8"">Batman</a>, super-heroes have made our nights in the theater all the more exciting and thought provoking. Now, with Marvel Comics' taking the studio reigns on ""Iron Man,"" they've done something totally new. ""Iron Man"" is the rare comic book movie that stands apart from its origins, a movie that could have been made without a back-mythology, and a film you can go see without previously knowing anything about the source material.<br /><br />A great deal of this has to do with the casting. Robert Downey Jr, as billionaire Tony Stark, brings enough snarky humor to his conflicted billionaire playboy genius that you totally fall for the act. As his rival Obadiah Stane, Jeff Bridges obviously relishes getting to play baddie. He's all oily charm and malevolence, and watching is descent into the Iron Monger is a marvel (pun intended). Speaking of Iron Monger, the suits, oh the suits. When Tony Stark perfects the second Iron Man outfit (with the help of his AI companions), it really will make you believe he can fly. Even with the CGI, the suits look realistic and hot.<br /><br />The suits do battle and it's better than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570"">Transformers</a> fights (which were both done by the same company). The other ""training exercise"" shots, like the one with the fighter planes, are pulse-racing fun. The gadgets are worthy of a Bond Film, and the humor that slides in helps give the movie balance. (Like Stark's commentary to his robots during suit tests, for example.)<br /><br />Balance is also achieved by the rest of the cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as the loyal Pepper Potts and Leslie Bibb as reporter Christine Everhart. Terrence Howard (who is underused) plays Stark's best friend Jim Rhoades. Stan Lee makes the obligatory cameo, and the assorted bad guys are, well, the current middle eastern terrorists du-jour. (It is worth noting that the ultimate evil-doer here is not a foreigner...)<br /><br />All in all, a great Good Vs Evil night at the movies, down to the Black Sabbath finally popping up in the credits. And was it me, or did the end credits pay homage to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OCMR"">Tron</a>, a movie Jeff Brides just happen to be in?

(quite literally)  This movie is not just another superhero-comic book rip off.  It's writing at its best.<br /><br />Ok...so it had cool gadgets; great cars; funny jokes and a  formulaic plot line---but don't let that deter you.  This flick was worth more than the price of three admissions.<br /><br />In  a nutshell, this film had everything for all people.  If you read just a bit between the sheets; the antiwar anti bureaucracy undertones satisfy even the most left wing of liberals.  The rah rah Americanism will please the hard line neo-cons and the gadgets and firestorm Fx will appeal to geeks and kids alike.<br /><br />Best of all, this movie had heart.  If you weren't already a Downey fan, you probably were by the time you left the theatre.  Robert Downey Jr. seems the embodiment of Tony Stark as  every man's superhero.

4027912,B001I1NGHY, A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N,5.0," ""The truth is, I am Iron Man.""","Get ready to be entertained folks! I was preparing myself to be somewhat disappointed. After all, many of the comic books transformed to films have a history of sucking hard, but Iron Man comes through with a finely adapted screenplay, top notch action, not to mention a great cast. ILM again comes through with the best CGI money can buy, this time with a winner of film for a change. It also looks as if Robert Downey Jr. (an actor I had always liked) is back in his game. His unfortunate downward spiral in the mid 90's up through the last several years nearly destroyed his acting career. I hope this time around, he's here to stay.<br /><br />So, getting to the ""main course"" Tony Stark is a billionaire engineer genius/philanthropist and has  been compared to the likes of Leonardo Davinci. His inherited genius comes from his father who started it all designing weapons for the military where he picked up and designed some of the worlds most destructive weapons of war.During one of his excursions and promotional gigs to ""sell"" his new ""bang, bang"" toy, he is kidnapped during an ambush where he is forced to make the same weapon for ""the enemy"" that will be used on theirs. Stark decides to do something else, and in of all places, makes his greatest creation to free himself from captivity....""the suite"" which is a crude form of what will be his masterpiece.<br /><br />Upon his escape and back home, he has an epiphany. Instead of making weapons of death and destruction for the military, he wants to design things to help mankind and put an end to war. This does not settle well with his business partner Obadiah, played by the excellent Jeff Bridges who has ""alternate"" plans. There he designs the suit of all suits through trial an error to put a stop to his weapons being sold and placed in the wrong hands and defend those who need it the most. This immediately put him in the wrong cross hairs of everyone. Soon Obadiah discovers what Stark has created and copies his suit design, only far more destructive and menacing.<br /><br />Well worth watching, Iron Man finishes SOLID. Downey 's character has some great lines and lots of dry, sarcastic and quirky humor. It keeps a good flow through the entire film from start to finish. Of course in this day an age in film making, Iron Man finishes with the hint (and most likely the promise) of continuing stories to come in the future.

The cast led by  Robert Downey Jr. (in a terrific career-defining performance as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Terrence Howard (as Jim Rhodes), Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger), and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Virginia 'Pepper' Potts) is excellent! The directing by Jon Favreau (who also directed ""Elf"" (2003), ""Zathura"" (2005), & ""Made"" (2001) is excellent! The screenplay (which is based on characters by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby) by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby (both who also wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay for ""Children Of Men"" (2006), Art Marcum, & Matt Holloway (both who also wrote the story and screenplay to the upcoming ""Punisher: War Zone"" (2008) is excellent! The music by Ramin Djawadi (who also did the music to ""Mr. Brooks"" (2007) & the tv show ""Prison Break"") is excellent! The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who also did the cinematography to ""The Number 23"" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Dan Lebental (who also did the film editing to ""Elf"" & ""Zathura"") is excellent! The casting by Sarah Finn & Randi Hiller (who also did the casting to ""Vantage Point"" (2008), ""Never Back Down"" (2008), & the upcoming ""You Don't Mess With The Zohan"" (2008) is excellent! The production design by J. Michael Riva (who also did the production design to ""Zathura"" & ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007) is excellent! The art direction by Suzan Wexler (who also did the art direction to ""Spider-Man 3"" & the upcoming ""The Soloist"" (2008), which also stars Downey, Jr.) is excellent! The set decoration by Lauri Gaffin (who also did the set decoration to ""Zathura"" & the upcoming ""Land Of The Lost"" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Laura Jean Shannon (who also did the costume design to ""Elf"", ""Zathura"", & ""Made"") is excellent! This is an action-adventure comic-book movie that works on all cylinders. Robert Downey, Jr. was born to play Tony Stark / Iron Man. This is one of the best films of the year, if not, the best, by so far, this year. This is also a excellent movie to start the summer movie season off.",Iron Man
4027916,B001I1NGHY, AFLTHO3MB4825,4.0, Downey is TERRIFIC! But there is something missing...,"Robert Downey, Jr. is terrific as Iron Man. His character, billionaire Tony Stark, builds weapons for the U.S. military. Stark doesn't even realize that it is his own WMD's that are being used for 'evil' until he (spoiler alert) is kidnapped early on by Afghan rebels. Downey is absolutely terrific as Stark. It is the actor's ability to balance humor with drama that actually carries the film all the way through to its' conclusion. The special effects are also dynamite, and the Iron Man suit creation is awesome. The plot has good twists, and there is enough great excitement (in the first hour especially) and light humorous touches that also keep me glued to the screen. Like all movies about good vs. evil, though, there are usually some problems as to how the director defines the 'bad guys'. The action begins in Afghanistan when Stark is kidnapped (no more spoilers, I promise). The men who kidnap Stark are supposedly rebels, and at first they are pretty frightening. But low and behold, when all is said and done, we discover that these 'Arab' rebels are nothing more than more stereotypical villains that we have seen in countless movies before, and they are not very smart, either. You even have the bald, steely-eyed Arab who has murder in his eyes (and lucky for us he speaks pretty good English). As for villains other than the predictable 'Arabic' bad guy, the writers have thrown somebody else into the pot, so that is a relief. Still, I wasn't content with the supporting cast. Terrance Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, does a good job with what he has, which isn't a lot. And the always gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts (Stark's assistant), is engaging to look at. Her light humor and sex-appeal adds a lot to what could've been a heavy-handed story involving all men and action. Unfortunately she seems to have little to do. Every great superhero film that I know of always takes advantage of the 'love interest' (Lois Lane, Mary Jane Watson, etc.). I hope she will have more to do in the sequel. The same goes for Howard. And Jeff Bridges, wearing a bald head and a beard, is excellent as always, and a perfect foil for Downey's Stark. But it is Downey who really holds the film together. And despite the stereotypes and an action-packed ending that gives me pause, or a sense of deja vu, as if I had seen that same ending in some other summer movie last year, and the lack of things to do for Howard and Paltrow (is there some kind of romantic entanglement between Pepper and Tony Stark?), 'Iron Man' really is a great popcorn film. Downey gives us pretty much a 'one-man show', and he is nearly perfect.",Iron Man
4027917,B001I1NGHY, A2HVL790PBWYTU,5.0," ""Is this the last act of defiance from Tony Stark?""","Finally, Marvel Comics' ol' Shellhead arrives on the big screen, and he arrives with stunning force. I don't quite know if this is the best superhero film ever made, but IRON MAN's just about got me convinced that it at least ranks right up there with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMQW"">Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV"">Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition)</a>, and the first two SUPERMAN movies, with Christopher Reeve (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059Z8J"">Superman - The Movie</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IJ79V6"">Superman II (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>). Everything seems to have fallen into place for IRON MAN, from the knocked-out-of-the-park special effects to the well-written script, brought to life by a high caliber cast. It's just a good story told very well. And, as a bonus, it's surprisingly funny.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has got it all, riches and notoriety and an off-the-charts genius I.Q. A debonair gazillionaire who inherited Starks Industries, Stark has been content breezing thru his days as a freewheeling playboy/inventor. Swanky pad in Malibu. Fancy private jet with gorgeous stewardesses doubling as pole dancers. When asked to justify his company's role as the military's primary weapons provider, his flippant response is ""Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.""<br /><br />But his worldview is forever altered when he goes to the Middle East for a weapons presentation. Terrorists blow up his vehicle, the resulting explosion causing shrapnel to be imbedded in his chest, very close to his heart. A makeshift electromagnetic device (hooked to a car battery) is implanted in his chest cavity, to prevent the shrapnel from piercing his heart. The terrorists, who hail Tony as the most famous mass murderer in America, insist that he build missiles for them. Accordingly, Tony is kept in a cave and given access to scrap metal and missile parts. But, Tony Stark, with nothing left to lose, decides to build something else...<br /><br />This film is awesome, definitely a fan boy's giddy dream. IRON MAN brings the thunder, delivers the goods. There are so many highlight, pump-you-up moments here, to relish and hoot and holler for. The first appearance of the clunky Iron Man armor. The first time he takes flight. Tony's step-by-step (and often hilarious) development of the new, sleeker model. The first time the new model goes into action. And much, much more. Let me just say, eyeing schematics have never been so much fun. It's pretty contagious, the sheer fun and enjoyment experienced by Tony as he goes about putting together his armor. His underground lab is an eye-popping marvel of hi-tech gadgetry, which includes an artificial intelligence named Jarvis (in the comics, Jarvis is an all-too human butler of Tony's and the Avengers'). And when Iron Man finally truimphantly blazes thru the skies in ridiculous velocities - well, whew! No complaints at all, at all with how the Iron Man armors are imagined on screen. Prepare to get blown away.<br /><br />IRON MAN is peopled by stock characters, no lie. The faithful, beautiful long-suffering, long-in-love assistant. The backstabbing business partner. The terrorists. Even the hero of the film isn't cut from a new cloth (uncaring industrialist undergoing a moral 180). But here's the thing: when these cliches are played by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Robert Downey, Jr., well, then, the cardboard suddenly gains layers of depth.<br /><br />Iron Man had always been so far down my list of favorite superheroes, it's kind of pathetic. Before this film, I've never found him that interesting in the comic books. Too cold, too smug, too superior, too powerful...Plus, if you've been following the recent Civil War crossover event in the Marvel comics, Iron Man, in my eyes, played a very distasteful role. But Iron Man on screen is something else. On celluloid, he's dynamic and dazzling and oh so friggin' cool! But the thing that really puts it all together, that which makes this flick such a hands down winner and a box office monster, is Robert Downey, Jr. Downey brings his fabulous acting, his jaded charisma and his comic wit and timing to the role. And to see him breathe life into Tony Stark is to think ""Yes, of course!"" - the man fits the part so seamlessly. Still handsome, but there's a well worn look to him now. Downey's done stuff and lived life outrageously, good and bad. And, really, that's Tony Stark to a T. Even more than Tobey Maguire is Spider-Man, Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man. For an actor who's had his ups and downs and for a brilliant formerly heartless ex-weaponeer who's literally had a change of heart, redemption comes in rip-roaring heavy metal...",Iron Man

Michael Downey Jr. delivers a masterful performance in the role of Tony Stark, former weapons prodigy and multi-millionaire playboy who sees the error of his way and decides to do all he can to undo the damage wrought upon the world by his destructive creations. His call to action takes the former of Iron Man, a metal clad crusader who's all but impervious to conventional weaponry, has the ability to fly at supersonic speeds and comes equipped with the best technology of the day to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible.

4027923,B001I1NGHY, A25HYPL2XKQPZB,5.0, Iron Man rocks! A great summer movie even for Iron Man novices,"I'm not a comic book fan at all. So I know about Spiderman, Superman and Batman, but I know nothing of some of the ""minor"" superheroes that end up starring in big budget motion pictures. I know nothing about Iron Man's origin, the villians, and all of the backstory that go into the universe he lives in. Is the movie, IRON MAN, a movie I could enjoy when I don't know about or really care about Iron Man? The answer is YES. Bases on box office returns and great reviews, the public loved this movie. The critics got this one right. This really is a good movie.<br /><br />The strength of the movie starts with the cast. You have Oscar winners Robert Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow. Downey is excellent as Tony Stark, the rich industrialist weapons manufacturer. Stark is a womanizing playboy who has every gadget imaginable, but few if any true friends. Pepper Potts (Paltrow) is his harried assistant who perhaps harbors long buried feelings for Stark. Jeff Bridges is okay as Obidiah Stane, Stark's partner who has big things in mind for Stark Industries. Perhaps the best thing about Bridges' performance is his bald head and huge beard. It is pretty funny. The rest of the cast is stellar.<br /><br />The plot seems to be standard superhero stuff. I was worried that the movie might try and make a politcal statement about war. After all, the plot involves a gigantic weapons manufacturer and Islamic terrorists. The movie wades through these waters with ease, giving it realism while never offending any one's political beliefs.<br /><br />The movie has some violence that could be too harsh for younger children. There is some adult situations but no bad language. The sountrack is great and the set designs (like Stark's house) are incredible. This is a fun movie and I know I'll never read an Iron Man comic book, but I can't wait for the next movie.",Iron Man
4027924,B001I1NGHY, A2UUP58XPQW3GF,4.0, 4  Star,"The next anticipated movie from the Marvel line of comic books is ""IRON MAN"". There has been an overload of comic book films and thankfully, this one doesn`t have ""Fantastic Four`s"" quality. ""Shellhead"" goes to the big screen courtesy of director Jon Favreau with a solid screenplay by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. Yes, the movie is great and as with ""Spider-Man"" is the cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be. Yes, everything but it didn't quite unseat ""Spider-man 2"" as Marvel's best comic adaptation. (in my opinion)<br /><br />Anthony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a billionaire industrialist/inventor and dubbed as a ""Merchant of War""; Stark makes most of his fortune making weapons for the military. One day, fate intervenes and Stark finds himself captured and injured by terrorists. With the aid of a man named Yinsen (Shaun Toub), Stark creates a suit of armor from scratch and escapes the clutches of the terrorists.<br />This experience had apparently affected Stark in a life-changing way. Now he intends to use his resources to the betterment of mankind, much to the dismay of Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). To atone for his sins, Stark builds a steel-mesh suit and becomes the ultimate human fighting machine...<br /><br />When I said that the film is a cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be, it is because the screenplay carries references to the Shellhead's comic series from his very origin. Never try to ""fix"" something that's not broken. The backdrop has been changed from Vietnam to Iraq; and this is a very clever move since it does relate to current events. Characters from the comic make a appearance; Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Yinsen, Obadiah Stane (strong references to ""Ultimate Iron Man""), Jarvis the robotic assistant (Jarvis the butler was probably avoided due to similarities to Batman's Alfred) and Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). S.H.I.E.L.D., ""War Machine"" and the Avengers Initiative anyone? The film carried a surmountable amount of teases that can have the avid comic fan very excited. Writers Fergus and Ostby definitely did their homework on this one.<br /><br />All these factors and the solid direction by Favreau makes for a very entertaining fun movie. The direction has near-excellent structure. I didn't notice any plot holes at all and the execution is solid, the direction knew exactly what it wanted to do and sticks to it. This can be a double-edged sword and I'll explain in a minute. I truly commend the first act of the film as Stark is portrayed as a man very much in for himself who realizes the consequences of his inventions. Why is it so much easier to invent weapons of destruction than to make things to advance mankind? The film does have a strong moral message and a nice touch of humanity. We're fallible, but what matters is how we make our following choices.<br /><br />The film is also blessed with a great cast. Downey does make a good Tony Stark, and the supporting cast does mesh well. Gwyneth Paltrow's ""Pepper Potts"" may seem a little ""doopie"" but I rather thought that it was her character in the comic. Tony is a playboy and boy, I was very amused by his escapades. Hopefully, the cast is signed for its sequel. The action scenes are decently shot and the best one I think is Shellhead's invasion into enemy territory. The battle with ""Iron Monger"" is a little short and not exactly as bone-crushing as I would've preferred it to be but I suppose it fits the film's pace. Boy, the CGI can trample the EFX in ""Tranformers"". Shellhead is a ""global"" super-hero with concerns that surpass bank robberies and criminals.<br /><br />Now, before anything else, let me make it very clear that I really thought that ""Iron Man"" is a great movie. Great structure, AMAZING special effects that puts most CGI to shame and clever dialogue. But the film seemed too `safe"" and while the script was very good, it just didn't feel that it was willing to take risks and somehow, I think it didn't realize its full potential. The villain is a little underwhelming and as to be expected, the hero will encounter his exact opposite, that ends up being predictable. Just who is Obadiah Stane in the comic book? He is the man who trampled Stark to the ground and drove him to alcoholism. The man should be cunning and evil, not reduced to a power hungry, greedy businessman.  As great as the movie is, it just didn't offer any surprises and I felt like I was just watching just another ""super-hero"" movie and I`m ready for the next one. Maybe if this came before the first ""Spider-man"" (that launched the super-hero new wave) then this film would be just awe-inspiring. The film just put me in very familiar territory that I really felt as if it was the same old thing. Some scenes proved too silly for my tastes but it was still entertaining. Are these signs of super-hero overdose?<br /><br />Despite the feeling of ""super-hero"" burnout, the villain becoming too routine and with the film being too ""safe"" for its own good, I really believe ""Iron Man"" is still a great effort in the super hero genre. At least, it knew what it wanted to do; entertain the young and old alike. The film is not pretentious and despite the limits it imposed on itself, the film is a very entertaining and a great summer film. Undoubtedly, this film will stand as one of the best super-hero flicks to grace movie theaters.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  stars]<br />This review was drafted in June 2008.",Iron Man
4027925,B001I1NGHY, A73QPH7NGI0DJ,5.0, The golden avenger scores in his first film.,"Marvel kicked off the current age of superhero films with 1998's ""Blade"" and 2000's ""X-Men"", and the vast majority of the films made have been based on their properties, but it has not been especially lucrative for Marvel Comics itself until ""Iron Man"", when they went into business for themselves and began making their own films.  ""Iron Man"" is the debut, and it's a huge success both financially and critically; combined with the not-as-good but watchable ""The Incredible Hulk"" and the future looks bright for Marvel Studios.<br /><br />Tony Stark, aka Iron Man is a member of a select club of superheroes that includes Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Spider-Man: heroes who have been consistently published in their own book since their creation. In Tony's case, this is his 46th year of continuous publication through four different volumes. Not bad, really; the character has usually occupied a middle-to-low position on the sales charts, but consistency outstrips flashes in the pan.  His past history in other media includes a number of animated series (most famously the 60s cartoon of which the most memorable thing was the enjoyably cheesy theme tune), but this is the character's first film adventure.<br /><br />Looking only at the plot, this is a pretty standard origin film:  billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr., phenomenal) is a famous playboy (think Bruce Wayne if Wayne was actually enjoying himself) who is caught by the enemy in wartime Afghanistan (the modern version of his origin detailed by Warren Ellis, updated from the original Vietnam), and builds a suit of powered armour to escape captivity.  He arrives home a changed man, vowing to take on the military-industrial complex at home while protecting the innocent abroad.  This doesn't go over especially well with his board of directors, including his father's old partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, bald).  Meanwhile, Tony's girl friday, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow, returning to the screen after an absence of a few years), and his best friend General James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) worry about what he's up to.<br /><br />The film is a hodgepodge of different areas of the comics, distilled: the basic origin and Pepper Potts' presence are from the original Stan Lee/Don Heck era, though otherwise this is strongly influenced by the Layton/Michelinie period, particularly the presence of James Rhodes as the lead male supporting character, and Tony's immediate motivation for becoming a superhero, which is modelled heavily on ""Armour Wars"".  Obadiah Stane, repurposed from the O'Neill era, is the main villain.<br /><br />As earlier stated, it's a basic origin film, but it's the execution and the details that elevate it to the level of excellence.  Downey Jr. is indispensable as Tony Stark, created one of the most likeable characters yet seen in a superhero film; relentlessly charismatic and amusing in a way that strongly recalls Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow.  Bridges, as Stane, does a strong job as Tony's corporate foe, although he isn't an especially big part of the story; indeed, probably the best stuff in the movie are the scenes when it is just Downey Jr. and some robotic props developing the armour.  There's a spectacular setpiece battle when Iron Man first takes the fight to terrorists in Afghanistan, and later returns to rescue a village, concluding with a dogfight with the US Air Force.<br />Mild criticism might be that the final defeat of the Iron Monger is vague and not especially climactic, but it suits the purpose well enough.<br /><br />The film is peppered with setup for future Marvel projects: SHIELD (and, if you stay after the credits, ol' Nick himself, talking about his ""Avenger Initiative""), an expansive terrorist network referred to as the ""Ten Rings"" (of the Mandarin), and, my favourite, Rhodey vowing ""next time, baby"" on seeing a silver-grey suit of Iron Man armour.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",Iron Man
4027926,B001I1NGHY, AZCDCO6KK2T81,5.0, Iron Man Strike Box Office GOLD!!!!!,"This is one of the best comic to film adaptations produced based upon a literate script, terrific performances, solid direction, and special effects that aren't over-the-top!<br /><br />I don't want to take this kind of entertainment too seriously, so I will not go with the long summary of the plot and simply give a quick recap of it and what I liked best and least about this totally fun-filled film.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. is NOT the kind of person anyone would expect to play a superhero and that is precisely why this film works so well in casting him as one as his character is the total opposite of a superhero at first.  Downey, as Tony Stark, is a self-absorbed jerk who lives for fast women, fast cars and fast money while profiteering off of war.  He is the living example of why we don't want unmanned aircraft bombers.  We want the human element.  We don't want war to be reduced to a video game and have lives reduced to a blimp on a screen, but this is how Stark lives when we first meet him.  He creates weapons of mass destruction without ever understanding or caring about his weapons' impact on the world, let alone who ends up with them.  It's the all mighty dollar hidden under the cloak of patriotism.<br /><br />This all changes when Stark is kidnapped in Afghanistan and sees how his weapons are falling into enemy hands and how the lives of innocent people are affected by his ""toys.""  Once he escapes, he slowly becomes a new man, in more ways than one and it's nice that he's a hero by choice and not some experiment gone.  Stark is assisted by a number of people from his glorified secretary well-played by Gwenyth Paltrow to his military connection nicely acted by Terrence Howard.  Of course, it is no secret at this point, and very highly predictable anyhow, that his family's best friend and second in command at his company is out to circumvent Stark's efforts to stop bloodshed.  Jeff Bridges hams it up some in this role, but he's convincing and fun as the eventual villain.<br /><br />The Misses:<br /><br />1) This material, as entertaining as it is, is beneath Paltrow who is a very serious actress and should be doing things far worthier of her talents.<br /><br />2) The plot element of the family friend running the business for personal gain is far too reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNJV"">Batman Begins</a>.<br /><br />The Hits:<br />1) There are only two significant ""misses"" with this film and, to be honest, they aren't all that significant (just enough for me to note them)<br /><br />2) The casting is perfect and inspired.  While I believe that Paltrow is better than this kind of film, she gives a very spirited performance.  Downey is just down right perfect for the this flawed hero and Bridges is just plain fun in his juicy role.<br /><br />3) The special effects DO NOT take over this film, as they did in the equally fun, but over-the-top <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570"">Transformers</a>.<br /><br />4) The direction is confident and unobtrusive which I can't say for a film such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T8C"">Spider-Man 3</a> which was directed well enough, but Sam Rami just tried a little too hard to put his stamp so-to-speak on it.<br /><br />5) This film is entertaining, but not in the kind of mindless way that other superhero films have been.  This film has some heart and soul.<br /><br />6) I can't say enough about the literate script for this film.  It can be funny one moment and cerebral the next.  That is tough to do in this comic book adaptation genre.  It usually goes too much one way in seriousness as with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ICM5W6"">Hulk</a> or too slapstick silly as with too many moments in Spider-Man 3.  This film finds a comfortable balance between serious and humorous.<br /><br />This is an outstanding film and I look forward to the two sequels that are currently planned for this new comic book hero to make it to the silver screen.",Iron Man
4027927,B001I1NGHY, A3AAK33K3BUUTM,5.0," The word ""awesome"" get thrown around a lot...","...particularly by me.  But this is one film that actually manages to live up to everything one might expect from all that that word entails.  This is quite possibly the greatest superhero film ever. At times it leaves you nearly breathless, leaving you just enough to whisper ""bada$z"" in awe of what you just witnessed (a friend of mine actually did this).  The CG effects are wholly indistinguishable from the practical ones, the action comes in somewhat small but memorable doses, and most importantly the story takes it's time developing it's characters and their unique relationships.  And that is where ""Iron Man"" hits it's home run: characters you thoroughly enjoy watching that make the action sequences and special effects just icing on the cake.<br /><br />The movie does not waste time getting you into the good stuff.  The opening sequence does a great job of summing up the audaciousness, charm, and humor of weapons dealer/genius inventor/billionaire Tony Stark just before his caravan is attacked.  The last thing he sees as he dives for cover from the terrorists before blacking out?  An explosive with his company's name on it that sends shrapnel into his chest, setting the story in motion.  Beautiful.  Flashback to some days back and we get a better picture of our hero to be.  And let me tell you, it is good to be Tony Stark.  Robert Downey Jr. is everything you'd hope, bringing the kind of bombastic personality that just can't be portrayed in a comic book to the big screen. The supporting cast is also strong. Gwyneth Paltrow is radiant as Pepper Potts; snippy sometimes, cool and collected most times, and coy and awkward in potentially romantic situations.  Also worthy of note is Jeff Bridges' convincing performance as Stark's business partner Obediah.  The biggest change from the source material (and there are many) was replacing Jarvis the butler with a HERBIE-style (from the FF, not the Love Bug) talking computer.  But with the faithful butler having been done to death in the many Batman films, this change makes a lot of sense.  Also, Stan Lee's cameo is likely to cause outright guffaws, so be careful you don't spray your drink on the people in front of you.<br /><br />As usual, this Marvel superhero flick is peppered with references for comic geeks, lots of character-based humor, and moral arguments and choices.  Setting much of this story in the Middle East highlights the relevance of the story's message of accountability for our actions and our creations (I'm looking at YOU, America!) without being overtly political.  Tony Stark's realization that his works have brought death and destruction to so many and the subsequent hostile takeover attempt on Stark Industries when he attempts to do the right thing make for a great motivation to put on the armor and attempt to undo some of the damage that has been done in his name.  Good stuff.  And while it's no suprise that ""Iron Man"" has plenty of heavy metal in it's soundtrack, I wasn't expecting to hear Mister Stark admonish Miss Potts for turning down his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000007489"">Suicidal Tendencies</a> jam.  Now THERE'S a superhero I can relate to. So cool.<br /><br />I find sitting through 10 minutes of credits intolerable, so I left the theater before they had finished rolling and apparently missed a scene that I had been hoping for.  Now I regret it.  Don't make the same mistake. That's what I get for not reading any reviews ahead of time (spoilers and all that).  Either way, this is not a film to be missed if you're a fan of superhero flicks, comic books, science fiction, or just entertaining cinema.  This is a film firing on all cylinders and is sure to please all but the most jaded of fans.  It's about time that the Golden Avenger got his big-screen due, but it was worth the wait to see it dome so superbly.  There is a moment where Tony's military buddy James Rhodes watches him fly out of his lab to save the day then looks to the side to see a chrome suit (the War Machine, I presume) and says to himself/us ""next time, baby"".  I wouldn't miss it for the world.",Iron Man
4027928,B001I1NGHY, A2UL0A8GJB4318,5.0," ""Iron Man"" is an Instant Classic","Now this is how to make a summer movie.  ""Iron Man"" explodes off the screen with a combustible mix of superstar charisma, heavy metal thunder and the one thing other film's of it ilk willfully forget: soul.  Robert Downey, Jr., a gifted actor long haunted by demons manifested as substance abuse, powers this new-fangled classic as billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, infusing the splashy playboy with bone-dry wit, magnetic charm and, ultimately, huge amounts of heart.  At first, Stark is a willing and content cog in the military industrial complex, reaping huge profits from the sale of self-designed weapons while staying half a world away from the harsh consequences of their use.  And why should he care in the first place?  He's far too busy showing off his high-powered toys of mass destruction; that and bedding every beautiful woman he sees, much to the consternation of his best friend and military liaison Colonel Rhodes (Terrance Howard, every bit as stellar here as Downey, Jr.) and his loyal secretary Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).  Paltrow is doing some the best work of her career as Stark's romantic equal.  The chemistry between her and Downey, Jr. is palpable, sexy and resonant; kudos to director Jon Favreau and his large team of screenwriters, which includes the scribes for Children of Men, for knowing it's the little things like depth of character that really count.<br /><br />But Stark gets jolted to reality when his military convoy is attacked on a rural Afghani road by warlords who seek to use Stark's technical acumen for their own arsenals.  To add insult to injury, the convoy is attacked with Stark's own weapons, which the extremists have procured through black market sales and illegal arms deals.  Struck in a dank, suffocating cave, Stark first realizes the true gravity of making cavalier billions off of weapons of war.  Conscience awakened, he works to design a new prototype under the nose of those who hold him captive.  With it, he will flee and use it to destroy all the loose arms that are linked to him.  Favreau stages the escape with high impact pow, showing that this film might be battle cry of one of the next great directors.<br /><br />Back in America, Stark keeps himself in seclusion, perfecting a new battlesuit that will allow him to undo the wrong he has inadvertently committed, but not before trying to get his company, inherited from his gung-ho father, to discontinue weapons development.  However, his second in command, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges, a blazing villain), will have none of it.  To him, there's too much green in selling high caliber goods; peace politics are for those too weak to take power and wealth.  So its Stark and his reformed sense of responsibility versus high-rolling capitalism run amok, and their final battle, with two iron-suits rampaging across Southern California, is a doozy.  But the true joy of Iron Man is not its action or seamless special effects.  It's how it seamlessly integrates those elements into a resonant popcorn yarn that stands with the best of the best.  Folks, this is how it's supposed to be done.",Iron Man
4027929,B001I1NGHY, A2TXR85WQLE32N,4.0, The Man in the Iron Mask...,"2008's ""Iron Man"" is a very clever screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics superhero.  Robert Downey Jr. is a surprisingly good Tony Starks, billionaire weapons inventor, who rediscovers his humanity while a prisoner of terrorists.  Gwenyth Paltrow is his beautiful and very capable personal assistant Pepper Potts, while a buff Jeff Bridges has a nicely dark role as his corporate deputy.  Terrance Howard is Starks' strait-laced military liaison.<br /><br />As the story opens, Starks is in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapon.  His convoy is ambushed, and the wounded Starks wakes up in a cave, a survivor of unorthodox heart surgery by another hostage. His captors demand that he build them a superweapon.  Starks instead builds an iron suit that will allow him to escape.  The jury-rigged suit lasts just long enough to get out of his captors' clutches, but the experience leaves him a changed man.<br /><br />Upon his return, Starks tells his deputy, and the press, that he will take Stark Industries out of the weapons business, then locks himself in his lab to build a better iron suit.  In an inpromptu visit to a charity event, Starks discovers that he has lost control of the company and that his weapons are being sold indiscriminately around the world.  Starks takes on his Iron Man personna to set things right, not realizing how ruthless his real enemies are.  In a climactic fight scene, Iron Man faces off with an unexpected foe in a copy of his own super suit.<br /><br />The Afghanistan sequences are tightly paced and suspenseful.  The leisurely intermediate scenes, as Starks perfects his Iron Man suit, feature high tech and high humor.  The suspense is back on for the finale, with an ending that begs for sequels.<br /><br />Downey is entirely convincing as the very human man inside an iron mask.  Paltrow isn't given a lot to do, and her budding romance with Starks gets little screen time.  The Iron Man franchise has been nicely updated.  The movie might have benefited from tighter editing; it does just avoid overwhelming the story with CGI effects.  ""Iron Man"" is highly recommended to viewers looking for an entertaining action movie.",Iron Man

She combines beauty with a charming vulnerability, and is perfect in the role.

He fully inhabits this character and those familiar with his work will find him at first nearly unrecognizable, yet his acting talent is displayed to excellent effect.<br />He makes a surprisingly good villain, supplying the ""badness"" all heroes need as a foil to their ""goodness.""<br />The ending news conference is somewhat surprising, but on reflection, totally in character for the reckless Iron Man.",Iron Man

Now I think he's the coolest super-hero ever, which is a testament to just how great this movie is.<br /><br />The supporting cast is solid, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Robert Downey Jr. His Tony Stark is simply perfect -  he's an affable, arrogant womanizer, confident to a fault. As heir to a fortune made from arms sales he has no difficulties performing the mental acrobatics necessary to rationalize his role in facilitating fatalities. Downey is simply fun to watch - he makes the so called 'slow' segments, where he is maturing into his superhero role while building the suit, snappy and exiting.<br /><br />The single disc edition include some extended scenes but you'll have to put down a few dollars more to get the full set of extras on the 2 disc ultimate edition.

Neither the action segments nor the lulls, the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but, frankly, what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a ""kids"" movie made today. Thankfully, that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent ""Transformers"" film I viewed.<br /><br />The scenes with ""Iron Man"" a.k.a. ""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance, catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot, piloted by the corporate bad guy ""Obadiah Stane"" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see, too.<br /><br />Some complain the film is not really all that ""smart"" and it's a bit too predictable, but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters.

During his captivity he invents a new type of energy that allows him to make some awesome new developments, in the process a villian is revealed that is initially considered his friend, this villian steals the invention from him and they fight.<br /><br />Overall it did not seem as long as it was, and was extremely entertaining.

To respond to that reviewer, the film was rated PG-13, not G or even PG. Furthermore, don't get me started on why foul language/moderately graphic violence or other behaviors are allowed and tolerated in most big budget Hollywood films that ARE aimed at children! After all, this is a review of Iron Man. Most people who didn't 'get' Robert Downey's portrayal of Stark didn't ever read the original comics, or if they did, forgot much of what they read.<br /><br />Let's not forget that Tony Stark was the original rich, womanizing, misogynistic playboy who had an epiphany steering him onto a new course in life. I didn't all of a sudden go from a hard drinking, cigar smoking playboy to a Priest, but he DID change his ways. This was portrayed by Downey almost flawlessly.  To categorize this as a flawless performance would be difficult because movies about superhero characters lend themselves to so much broad interpretation from long time comic fans, to casual readers, to those who dismiss comics as 'kid stuff'.<br /><br />At it's heart, IM was a great movie that happened to be about a superhero. I'm glad that the movie wasn't action top to bottom. This made the action sequences more enjoyable, and highlighted the acting prowess of the great cast (how'd they get Gwyeneth Paltrow to sign on at Potts?!)

It's so economically directed, (it's directed by Foggy Nelson himself, Jon Favreau, from the highly underrated ""Daredevil"",) and so cleverly written, you forgive any sins the movie might committ along the way, (like how did Stark manage to make that rather lethal suit of INITIAL armor, [that in the comic book series he kept for about 40 issues,] from scraps found in the woebegone Afghani desert!?! Or how can he fly around the world on the tiny cannister of fuel he carries on himself while clad as Iron Man?)<br /><br />Anyway, what you enjoy most about this movie is the clever dialogue as delivered by Downey, the wizard action sequences as the sleeker, upgraded Iron Man goes about his business, and the finally, DECENTLY done CGI special effects, (in films about Marvel heroes, the CGI is too often WOEFULLY, obviously not real, ruining the illusion and hence the full enjoyment of some of the films. Both ""Hulk"" movies and the first two ""Spiderman"" flicks being cases in point.)<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow, who has a knack for being in really good sci-fi action movies that are a cut above the pack, (""Sky Captain"",) plays Tony Stark's/Iron Man's assistant and possible love interest Pepper Potts, (can you believe that name?!) Favreau gives himself a small part as Tony's chauffeur and Jeff Bridges, (who, I must say, has aged a bit since ""The Big Lebowski""...he actually seems upper-middle-aged here!) plays an old friend of Tony's dad with an impossible biblical sounding name, Obidiah Stain, that surprises us all by the end of the film.<br /><br />I have yet to see a bad review of this movie, and it IS enjoyable, but is it because of Downey, Bridges, Paltrow, ILM or what...?

4027947,B001I1NGHY, A3NKFB39AIEN8W,5.0, Robocop Jr.,"I rented Iron Man on DVD yesterday, and I had a chance to check it out last night. I had high expectations for this film---I expected more, a lot more, a hell of a lot more. Okay, it was a summer movie. Critics raved so much over Iron Man that I couldn't wait to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />My first gripe against Iron Man was the time it took to get to the action: about 40 minutes. There was too much exposition before the actual fireworks, and those fireworks were over in a blink. My second gripe against Iron Man was its conflict: weapons save lives, and weapons take lives. I wasn't expecting a brain-f**k, but I was expecting something more sophisticated. My third gripe against Iron Man was Gwyneth Paltrow. She's out of this world, and I would like to have seen more of her.<br /><br />On the plus side, Robert Downey Jr. invests more personality in a superhero than I am used to seeing. He plays the cold arrogant billionaire role with ease. Downey plays billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who's the antithesis of everything heroic. Tony grew up as a child prodigy. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, he built his first engine. At age seventeen, he graduated from MIT. And as CEO of the largest and wealthiest defense contractor in the world, Tony Stark has zero morals. He gambles, he drinks, he's irresponsible, and he's a womanizer.<br /><br />Tony pitches a new missile system, the Jericho, to the military in Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. There, a band of terrorists hijack Tony's Humvee. The terrorists overwhelm Tony's military entourage. The confrontation is furious and swift. Hours later, Tony awakens in a dark cave. His body is wet with sweat and blood, his clothes are torn, and he has a huge plug--an electromagnet--protruding out of his chest. This magnet keeps him alive by pulling the shrapnel embedded his chest away from his heart. Earlier, during the terrorist siege, an exploding bomb splintered and planted those splinters in Tony's chest.<br /><br />The terrorists torture Tony; they dunk his head underwater. Then they show him why they kidnapped him in the first place. They lead him out of the dark cave and into the light. Tony sees an enormous cache of stockpiled weapons--weapons manufactured by his company. The terrorists stockpile these weapons to use against American soldiers. Now the terrorists want Tony's help: they want Tony to build the Jericho missile system for them to use against American soldiers. The terrorists promise to release Tony if he cooperates. But Tony has other ideas. He builds an armored battle-suit equipped with flame-throwers. He escapes.<br /><br />Back home in the U.S., the press mobs Tony. He's sober.  He saw terrorists use his weapons to kill American soldiers; now, he wants to shut down the weapons development division of his company. He wants to use his company to make the world a better place. Tony's plans embitter his guardian and vice president Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who has his sights set on selling the Jericho missile system to the U.S. government. The action starts from this point of the movie.<br /><br />Like Batman, Iron Man has no natural powers; this implies that some heroes are made. The exterior insulation of Tony Stark's vanity and ego are the perfect counterpoint to Iron Man's cold titanium shell. Overall, Iron Man's a solid movie. It's worth buying, though it's not as good as Verhoeven's Robocop.<br /><br />Author of Gotta Be Down!",Iron Man

I've scrupulously avoided any spoilers for just about every summer movie out there, although more than one reviewer has given away quite a few surprises (I'm looking at you, Entertainment Weekly).  When we finally got a babysitter willing to take care of our little tyke for a few hours, we decided to given the second-run movie theater nearby a try.  And that movie was Iron Man.<br /><br />By now everyone knows the story of Iron Man: alcoholic weapons-merchant billionaire Tony Stark has a change of heart (literally) when shrapnel penetrates his ribcage and threatens to end his life.  Instead of making weapons, Stark vows to make a power suit instead...that is loaded with weapons, but let's not quibble over details.<br /><br />Iron Man is an adult's movie, which is to say it involves mature subjects like the fact that Stark is an inveterate womanizer, likes his alcohol, kills bad guys, and many of those bad guys look like Middle Eastern terrorists.  All this drama is tempered by Robert Downey Jr., who rattles off quips with abandon.  His keeper is Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges with suitable cranky menace).  Stark's assistant is the alliterative Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who runs the line between sweetly nave and sleekly sexy in her five-inch heels and pencil skirt.<br /><br />At its best, Iron Man features Stark uses his power suit to dodge jet fighters, kill terrorists, and rescue civilians.  The theater I was in didn't have very good audio, so the (presumably adlibbed) one-liners that Downey constantly tosses off were often lost in the sounds of explosions and screaming.  I imagine in a bigger theater or at home this wouldn't be a problem, but the movie lost some of its charm as a result.<br /><br />There are plot holes. Vanity Fair reporters show up at important news conferences. Stark seems far more interested in building a power suit than removing the shrapnel from his body.  And the entire premise of Iron Man revolves around ""repulsor lift"" technology, which is an infinite source of energy the size of a hockey puck that defies gravity. But if you didn't buy into the notion of a man in a flying suit, what are you doing watching the movie, right?<br /><br />Iron Man keeps the plot tight. Unlike Spider-Man, there are no extraneous supervillains. Unlike X-Men, every character is there for a reason.  But the big payoff for Iron Man is the ending.  Iron Man flips traditional superhero conventions the bird and dares you to guess what happens next.  Then it leaves you begging for more.<br /><br />And there IS more, if you stay for the end of the credits.  Unfortunately, I didn't read enough spoilers to realize I should have waited, so we missed it.  So for the three of you who haven't seen the movie yet...stick around!",Iron Man
4027950,B001I1NGHY, A2C3SRVCDMHF20,5.0, Easily the best of all Marvel movies so far,"I was really excited at the prospect of an Iron Man movie, but worried it'd be overloaded with SFX or that the character wouldn't work. I raised an eyebrow when I heard Robert Downey was playing Tony Stark, but decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Last time I did that, it was when Michael Keaton was cast in the first Batman movie.<br /><br />In both cases, my doubts were groundless. This movie is, in a word, superb. Usually I won't say that, especially about a modern SF film. This time, they got it absolutely right. The pacing is perfect, the characters are actually developed well, the story is well adapted to the 40+ year Iron Man mythos, and the SFX are used to support the story. Usually it's the other way around, with the effects totally overwhelming the rest of the film in order to please fanboy types and kids who just want eye candy.<br /><br />While the film is generally very serious, there are nice touches of both humor and romance. The supporting characters and actors -- and I mean ALL of them -- are excellent. Downey's characterization of Stark, and the gravitas he brings to the character once he realizes what his company has been doing with its weapons, is absolutely spot on. Jeff Bridges is perfect as Obadiah -- as callous a villain as ever walked the earth.<br /><br />Many film companies still seem to think all you need in any science fiction film are blinking lights, big explosions, and female characters in tight spandex. That's what Gene Roddenberry ran into when he tried to make the original Star Trek; the producers literally told him to stick in some blinking lights and start filming. Way too many SF films and TV series have fallen into that same trap.<br /><br />If this movie doesn't get film industry executives to re-think that position, they shouldn't be making movies. Then again, Peter Jackson's LoTR films have already proved SF films can be Oscar material.<br /><br />We need more movies like this. I can't wait for the 2nd installment.",Iron Man

4027952,B001I1NGHY, A2IGYM7K8MFJRC,5.0, Proper superhero action,"I am a big Marvel Comics fan, always have been, but I shall be amongst the first to throw stones at Marvel and Hollywood for the way they've treated so many of me childhood heroes on the silver screen. ""Spiderman"" was fine, but all the rest of the lot were... well, less than good.<br /><br />Then comes ""Iron Man"". I was expecting ""Fantastic Dare-Hulk 7"" but what I got was something different entirely. It was really good.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is well casted, well played, and indeed, well made. The action sequences doesn't steal the picture absolutely, as have been the case with earlier superhero films; nor does the film lack character development. The humour works, for a change, and although this film absolutely is sci-fi d'or, it somehow doesn't seem that far fetched. It is made believable, or at least acceptable.<br /><br />Some critics will probably say it is not fast paced enough, but not I. I think they made it just right with this one, and I'm genuinely looking forward to the next installment (if one is on the way, of course).<br /><br />Highly recommendable.",Iron Man
4027953,B001I1NGHY, AV5G37VFE5NVD,4.0," Not sturdy as steel, but certainly shiny as iron","Just as Iron Man is the king of Marvel's second-tier comic heroes, Jon Favreu's ""Iron Man"" rules over the second-tier Marvel film adaptations.  Though not on par with the finest Marvel adaptations, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" series and Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" films, ""Iron Man"" rules over all others with an iron fist.  It all rests on the shoulders of Robert Downey Jr., who portrays titular hero Tony Stark with all the reckless ego which so many now associate with Americans.  Stark is a true American hero: he wasn't born with any superpowers, and though he was born into a substantially-wealthy family, it is he who pushes his corporation to its limits and who ultimately goes beyond those limits to become one of the shiniest superheroes.  He's further separated from his peers by the fact that he doesn't live his life in painful rememberance, and thus it's not pain that motivates him to do good.  What does motivate him, probably not even he knows.<br /><br />Like its protagonist, ""Iron Man"" is not one of the deepest superhero films to hit the screen.  Unlike ""Batman Begins"" (the sequel to which, July's ""The Dark Knight,"" stands as ""Iron Man""'s fiercest competition), ""Iron Man"" does not delve deep into the psychosis of its hero, opting instead to focus on his struggles as an up-and-coming superhero.  Stark's origins are explored in a gritty fashion not unlike ""Batman Begins.""  The similarities between Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne further connect the two films, but Favreau's vivid, colorful style ensures that the similarities end there.  Favreau was an interesting choice to direct, given that his past filmography is highlighted by two family films, ""Elf"" and ""Zathura,"" but he doesn't disappoint.  Stark's non-iron-clad activities mimic the character's lavish lifestyle, while the action sequences may be the sturdiest in any Marvel film.<br /><br />But far more sturdy is Robert Downey Jr.  Like Favreau, Downey was an unlikely choice for the film, but Downey elevates the film to a level it could never have reached led by another actor.  In fact, this is the best thing Downey has ever done.  His dedication to the role and love of the character shines through every one of Stark's smarmy remarks, apparent in every arrogant move he makes.  Downey turns a character who could easily lose the audience's sympathy into a guy one can't help but love.  It's hard not to get excited about Downey's cameo in ""The Incredible Hulk,"" Marvel's next movie, released in mid-June.<br /><br />Though Downey could easily hold the film on his own, he's supported by a delightful cast.  Most delightful is Gwyneth Paltrow, who is as adorable and charming in the role of Stark's gentle secretary Pepper Potts as anyone.  One wishes a character so irresistible and clever as Potts would play a bigger role in the film, but no doubt that'll happen in the sequel.  Similarly likeable is Terrence Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, military pilot Jim Rhodes - and who, as any fan of the comic knows, will wind up as Stark's iron-clad sidekick, War Machine.<br /><br />The most surprising performance comes from Jeff Bridges.  Bridges, perhaps best known as ""The Dude"" from the Coen brothers' ""The Big Lebowski,"" isn't usually the bad guy.  But that's just what he is in this film, and what a villain he is!  As Stark's partner-turned-archenemy Obadiah Stone, Bridges exhudes a ruthlessness and complete lack of morality not seen in any other cinematic supervillain.  His performance is what Kevin Spacey should have aspired to when he portrayed Lex Luthor in ""Superman Returns.""  It's a welcome change from the over-the-top behavior most supervillains are so fond of.<br /><br />Superhero films tend to be fond of heavy effects; after all, most of the films require them.  But the effect of the effects tends to be lessened by underdeveloped or overused computer-generated imagery (case in point: the last superhero picture, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"").  Not in ""Iron Man.""  There's the inevitable amount of C.G.I. effects, but the effects have been precisely designed.  They may even surpass the stunning effects from last summer's ""Transformers.""<br /><br />All this would mean little if the movie was not based upon a decent script.  This script is a fine one indeed, the product of two writing duos (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway).  It never takes itself too seriously, but just seriously enough, choosing well-timed witticism over self-conscious grandeur (as in ""Daredevil"" or the last ""X-Men"" movie).  It also, miraculously, is able to appeal equally to those familiar and those unfamiliar with the comics.  Part of this is the sensible decision to upgrade Tony Stark from a Vietnam-era weapons designer to a military designer for the Iraq War.  But while it appeals to fans and non-fans, it's those familiar with the comic that will enjoy the film the most: it hints at a number of potential storylines for sequels, and even sets up an Avengers movie.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is one of the increasingly rare films which longs for a sequel and which we wish would receive one.  Now that the film has grossed a stunning amount of money at the box office, a release date for ""Iron Man 2"" has been set for April 30, 2010, and a second sequel is ready as soon as that one's finished.  Bring it on.  ""Iron Man"" may not be an excellent film like ""Spider-Man 2,"" ""Batman Begins,"" or even the original ""Superman,"" but it's a darn good superhero film.  And if not as sturdy as steel, it is certainly as shiny as iron.",Iron Man
4027954,B001I1NGHY, ATZ1LTONGHOP6,4.0, Stay until the end of the credits,"After being captured in Afghanistan and forced, against his will, to build a particularly nasty type of missile for the enemy, billionaire inventor and weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) instead builds himself a super-suit and escapes. Upon returning to the United States, Stark improves on his super-suit and then sets about trying to correct all of the damage he has done through the sales of weapons.<br /><br />I did not expect to like ""Iron Man"". I have seen a lot of superhero films in my life and I usually find that the acting is second-rate and the endings are irritatingly open-ended. The only reason why I went to see ""Iron Man"" at all was because my father wanted to see it and I just went along to keep him company. I'm now glad that I did, because it is a surprisingly good film.<br /><br />I have always considered Robert Downey Jr. to be an excellent actor (I still think he should have won the Best Actor Oscar for ""Chaplin"") and his performance in ""Iron Man"" is no exception. Downey turns in one of his best performances in years and is ably supported by Jeff Bridges as the film's villain. Furthermore, the film's ending provides enough closure so that this film can stand by itself without sequels (although, I am certain that the film's makers would be more than happy to continue the franchise).<br /><br />The film's script is filled with the sort of light-hearted bantering that is typical of a Robert Downey Jr. film but also has a point to make about the culpability of weapons manufacturers. I particularly liked the fact that this film was set in the real world, rather than in a universe that exists almost parallel to our reality, like ""Batman"" or ""Superman"". My main criticism of this film is that it is just so predictable. Some of the plot twists I could see coming for almost an hour before they eventuated.<br /><br />Overall, this film is definitely worth your time and money. ""Iron Man"" is targeted at a more mature audience than films such as ""Spiderman"" or ""X-Men"", but it still should appeal to viewers of all ages. And if you do go and see it, make sure you stay until the end of the credits. Although the credits are very long, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, those who do sit through them are rewarded by an extra scene at the end of them, which is definitely worth the wait.",Iron Man
4027955,B001I1NGHY, A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,5.0, Downey Triumphant as the Invincible IRON MAN,"Although not as well known as other Marvel Comic icons as Spiderman or X Men, this film adaptation of Iron Man works due to the sure hand of director Jon Favreau (Swingers, Elf) who cleverly mixes action, drama, humor, and a totally winning performance by comeback actor, Robert Downey Jr.  In terms of a first film showing a superhero's origin, it is the one of the best to date.<br /><br />Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer whose cavalier attitude and playboy appetite are matched only by his sheer genius in technology.  On a tour of his weaponry in Afghanistan, he is wounded in the heart by shrapnel and captured by rebels who order him to build a super weapon of mass destruction.  With the help of another civilian, Stark changes up and instead builds a powerful suit of high tech armor that sustains his weak heart and enables his escape but not without a price.  Guilt ridden and traumatized by his experiences, Stark has a literal change of heart and alters the militaristic direction of his company much to the chagrin of his elder partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).  A couple of friends, his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and military liaison, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), stick loyally by Stark's side despite his earlier predilections.  Intent on improving and perfecting his Iron Man suit, Stark experiments with its design and takes dangerous risks.  His mission is to utilize his Iron Man technology to fight the evil in the world, starting first in Afghanistan.  When the truth comes out about what Stark Industries is really doing with weapons sales, it leads to a deeper conspiracy and a battle of titans as Iron Man meets an old foe.<br /><br />Buffed and in terrific physical condition, Downey is quite convincing as the prodigy whose initial devil-may-care attitude must undergo a transformation.  (It is not without irony that the role and the person should merge in light of Downey's real life, personal setbacks.)  The movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes the most of his role.  Bridges is great at playing a businessman with a sinister agenda.  Paltrow strikes sparks with Downey and you yearn for more scenes with the two of them.  The same goes for Howard as Stark's best friend.  What is a little hard to swallow is how Pepper and Rhodes could put up with such a pompous persona in the early goings.<br /><br />Favreau has an amusing bit part as an assistant to Stark.  Further, the robotic voice that assists Stark in his technological work is actor Paul Bettany!  And yes, Stan (the man) Lee, one of the comic book creators, has a fleeting cameo.<br /><br />The scenes, which show Stark developing his updated Iron Man suit and test-driving it, are realistic and at times amusing.  The Iron Man suit 2.0 is a marvel of construction and is the coolest thing imaginable. There is no way that this concept of a hero could have been rendered as convincingly even a few years ago.  My how movie magic has caught up with these stories finally and done them justice.  It is clever how the film incorporates the original Iron Man design (which brings to mind a sort of poor man's version of Robocop) and progresses through its more modernized version.  Pure fans of the original comic (including myself) are thrilled at the reverence paid to the classic beginnings.<br /><br />There is an aerial battle between American fighter jets and Iron Man that is a lot of fun.  The special effects, while being among the most realistic and cleverly used in any action film, are well integrated with the strong narrative.  Despite the eye candy, you get the feeling that the filmmakers never lose sight of what the story is about and how to stay focused on the characters.  The pacing is excellent.<br /><br />In terms of subplots, the Afghan conflict hits close to home with the current war in Iraq.  Also, the secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gets an introduction as support for Stark and figures to have a bigger role in future Marvel movies; don't forget to stay until the credits are done for a bonus.  The film has an edge about it in dialogue and theme, and is better for it especially in the final scene, which is surprising and has implications for future adventures.<br /><br />I would put this film on par with Batman Begins and Spiderman, not bad company.  While not as emotionally stirring as the best moments of X Men United or Spiderman 2, this is only the first of what likely will be a long running franchise.  If the sequel can maintain the same quality as this effort, we could be in for the best superhero movie yet!  And lest there be any doubt about Favreau's ability to take on comic heroes, don't worry; he understands what they mean and how to do them justice.  He `get's it'!",Iron Man
4027956,B001I1NGHY, A18G7GG53G2X8A,5.0, Saving the World One Weapon at a Time,"If Superman has Lex Luthor and Spider-Man has Dr. Octopus and Batman has the Joker, who exactly is Iron Man's archenemy? He may engage in ferocious battle with an equally ironclad baddie near the end of the film, but I'm going to go in a much more existential direction and say that his greatest enemy is himself. In Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man,"" billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) eventually realizes that the ultra high tech weapons he designed have done much more harm than good, so in a way, the climactic fight scene at the end was his own doing. What a perfect display of irony, especially for a superhero trying to free himself of his infamous reputation as a war-mongering mass murderer. Where exactly is the line drawn? At what point can weapons of mass destruction ever be considered a path to peace?<br /><br />You don't normally associate moral dilemmas of this magnitude with a comic book adaptation. The thing is, the idea of a suited man fighting against an adversary plotting to take over the world is not lost in ""Iron Man""--it just takes on a much different form. In this case the adversaries are war and injustice, both of which shake their threatening fists at the world every hour of every day. What is lost in ""Iron Man"" is the idea that a superhero has to be a perfect, emotionless drone that tirelessly fights for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Even with his money, his brilliance, and his specially designed suit, Stark is about as flawed as the average Joe walking down the street. He's stubborn, cocky, just a smidge arrogant, and after being held captive in Afghanistan for three months, he's far too willing place himself in scenarios he may not be ready for.<br /><br />Before being held captive, Stark was a smooth-talking businessman that designed the most advanced weapons the American military has ever seen. While in Afghanistan introducing a new missile-launcher called the Jericho, he's attacked and kidnapped by a militant group of Afghani extremists. They demand that he manufacture the Jericho for them, and since they somehow have gained access to many of his weapons, this shouldn't be too difficult. But even with a metal device implanted in his chest (supposedly to keep the shrapnel in his body from reaching his heart), he refuses to be under their control; with the help of an Afghani scientist (Shaun Toub), Stark secretly builds a prototype metal suit that can throw flames and shoot bullets and protect him from enemy fire. An elaborate escape scene leads to his rescue, which paves the way for a hilarious moment back in Los Angeles: as he sits in a limo refusing medical treatment, he demands that someone get him an American cheeseburger.<br /><br />Stark's experience triggers a newfound sense of responsibility, one that inspires him to shut down the weapons division of his company and focus on more humanitarian uses for technology. His colleague--Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges)--doesn't go along with this for reasons that are expected in comic book adaptations, such as being power-hungry. This doesn't stop Stark, who begins redesigning his metal suit in the comfort of his luxurious, technologically advanced Malibu estate. After installing a few upgrades, like rocket boosters and missile launchers, he tests his new red and gold suit by flying back to Afghanistan and attacking the same militant group that kidnapped him. How convenient that he happens to arrive just as they're raiding a village and taking civilians captive; superheroes save the day strictly because of convenient plot devices, and that's one of the reasons why we like these movies so much.<br /><br />With the help of his personal assistant, the anxious but highly capable Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and his friend, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), Stark spends the rest of the film trying to put an end to his past reputation, first by finding out how the Afghanis received crates of his weapons, second by battling against Stane, who has let his position in the company get the better of him. Yes, it's all enhanced by a wealth of impressive special effects, but that's not the point: Stark is introduced as a man who has everything while at the same time having nothing, and most of this stems from his unwillingness to acknowledge his effect on the world--he essentially got rich making and selling weapons, devices that kill and maim. Now that he's seen the error of his ways, he wants to redeem himself by fighting against the monster of his own creation. He does this all while maintaining a smug yet charming attitude, which is good because a superhero should be allowed to have a little personality.<br /><br />Even better than that is not hiding that personality behind an alter ego, one that behaves as an obvious polar opposite to the hero. This story may be pure comic book fantasy, but Tony Stark brings a realism to it that's refreshing, more so than anything ever seen from Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne combined. It's essentially because of him that ""Iron Man"" transcends anything I've previously expected from a comic book adaptation. He says at a press conference that he's not the superhero type, and that's really funny because I thought the same thing about Robert Downey, Jr. when I saw the first ads for ""Iron Man""; at the time, it seemed unlikely that he would be the type to fly alongside jetfighters or to shoot highly explosive missiles at tanks. But it's obvious now--he was exactly what was needed to realize the reworked idea of hero versus enemy. A lot of cool digital effects weren't a bad touch, either.",Iron Man

I felt that nothing new was added to the comic book adaptation genre, not in plot, screen writing or even special effects. It looked to me like it has all been done and seen before. I did not quite understand what all the hype surrounding this movie was about Robert Downey Jr. was not very convincing as a good guy i liked him better when he was selling weapons and couldn't care less about anyone else, his good side felt to me as somewhat forced on him, didn't believe it. Although i love Gwyneth Paltrow i hated this part for her, it was just meaningless and very secondary, any up and coming actress could have done that role.

4027958,B001I1NGHY, AUTBHG6070SL4,5.0," Great movie, comic or no","Standards have been rising in the comic adaptation genre, and the new Iron Man comes in at the top of the range. This is one of the best comic adaptations ever, and a very good action flick in itself. It gets the summer movie season off to a flying start - if the rest of the season's movies rise to this level, it's going to be a great year.<br /><br />Effects are everythig you could ask, with lots of explosions, fire, and other good enterainment - but that's the norm these days. Plenty sets this apart from the pack. Acting is way up there, as the star-laden cast would have you expect. Scripting offers a blend of humor, action, sneering bad guys, and simmering romance that's hard to beat. It gives Robert Downey Jr. lots to work with, including an outstanding aide in the form (the lovely form) of Paltrow's ""Pepper Potts."" The main bad guys are the current evil-du-jour, mideastern madmen - so recognizable that they don't even need motives. Heck, even the industrial robots have more personality than the entire casts of some comic flicks.<br /><br />One of the most implausible of plot turns really brought this to life for me: Stark's sudden rethinking of the multi-generation arms business. As an engineer and as one who's tried (not always successfully) to keep my work out of weapons, that exerted more of a pull than there was any rational reason to expect. But that's way too serious for this movie. Even if it jumps the season by a few weeks, it's great summer fun.<br /><br />-- wiredweird",Iron Man

I won't bother going into the storyline, since most already know it by now considering how smashing a success the film proved to be at the box-office, but it does go without saying that Iron Man is the best Marvel film to see the light of day, outshined only by X2: X-Men United.  Robert Downey Jr is perfectly cast as billionaire industrialist and weapons developer Tony Stark, and Jon Favreau is definitely the right man for the job in helming the film.  It's perfectly paced and pays wonderous homages to the classic comics that it's adapted from, all the while featuring an ending that have you simply salivating for what's to come not only in the realm of Iron Man, but of Marvel as a whole.  As a superhero film, Iron Man is definitely close to the top (but nowhere near The Dark Knight, which takes the notion of the superhero movie and turns it on it's head), with the only drawback for me personally being that I just couldn't get into Terrence Howard as James Rhodes.  I don't know what it is, I jsut don't find him all that well-casted as Rhodes as I do everyone else in the film.  Still though, Iron Man is a pure blast for nearly it's entire running time, and here's hoping that Favreau, Downey, and co. can keep the magic coming.",Iron Man

Disc one had a problem loading yesterday, but it was due to a server problem as the disc tried to access BD live. Paramount corrected the situation, and the disc plays perfect now. If your disc is taking long to load...If you have your PS3 settings set to automatically connect to the internet for BD-Live content, then the 'Iron Man' BD does that first thing. It takes about 5 minutes to download and initialize that feature. Just let the disc load once and it will load quickly everytime afterwards. Or, you can turn off the automatic internet feature under your XMB BD settings.<br /><br />When I was watching my BD for the first time, I went through the same thing. Anyway, I wonder if the startup time is just different for everyone because of a hit on their servers or something.

While successes like Spider-Man and XMen tore it's way to the top with ease, there's also the ones that got clobbered like The Punisher and the first attempt at Hulk in 2003. But with CGI technology reaching closer heights than ever before, now Hollywood has the ability to truly turn those ink and color panels to life, and no opportunity has been better received than with Iron Man.<br /><br />Tony Stark is basically a war profiteer that he and his company Stark Industries creates and manufacturers weapons so the good ole USA can win in a variety of battles, and in these reflective times, the battle currently is in the Middle East. When he himself is captured during a weapons demonstration that leaves numerous deadly pieces of shrapnel permanently close to his heart, he and a fellow scientific prisoner implant a device in his chest to keep them from reaching that area & in return becomes a major power source. When the captors want Stark to create an ultimate bomb, Stark turns the tables and creates a bodysuit of armor to escape and in return he realizes that he cannot go on in building weapons that usually just falls in the wrong hands, and unknowingly to Stark, by his business partner whose only concern is the almighty dollar and Tony's demise. So with his new and improved version of the suit that helped his escape, he's gonna beat them at their own game and find his superhero within.<br /><br />Let's state one thing:this is a GREAT cast. Robert Downey Jr not only looks the part of Tony Stark, but with his natural ego-driven comicial flair, he was born to play this role. Even the supporting cast of Jeff Bridges (who with his shaven head & beard might be hard to recognize), Terrence Howard, and a surprisingly Gwyneth Paltrow, who you'd figure would do a role like this in the early stages of her career not the opposite, bring the story along with a great pace. There's really not a weak link in the bunch. As for the CGI effects, of which most times I personally dread, they come off very natural and believable here. Where as in 2008's The Incredible Hulk when the lead character was of organic origin, Iron Man is pure solid-looking steel and because of that fact can be replicated much better without any doubt if the object is really on the screen or not. Visually all parties pulled off an amazing feat with Iron Man and honestly without flesh and blood to get in the way, the CGI does what at this point it can truly do best.<br /><br />Even though this review is for the single-disc edition, Paramount still gives you quite a value here than just a typical bare-bones disc. With a film presentation that has one of the best looking and sounding standard definition combos I've ever seen, they also include on it over twenty-four minutes of extended & deleted scenes which at least half of are worthy of a director's cut. There's even an Easter Egg hidden here maybe giving you a preview of what extras the 2 discer might have in store for you. So for fans on a limited income, or those that just want the movie, you won't go wrong by buying the smaller content version. While a commentary by Downey would have been nice (neither version has one), there still is plenty to enjoy with this presentation.<br /><br />Overall this was a great origin superhero film that didn't drag one bit within it's 2 hours and 2 minutes. Great cast, great story, and a bonus ending scene (featuring a surprising cameo) that will make you demand more in the near future. And unlike The Dark Knight, that took itself way too seriously, Iron Man still mentions problematic issues concerning war today and thrilling us all along the way.<br /><br />P.S.: The two-disc version has extensive behind the scenes and interviews with the film's cast and crew that in my opinion could have brought my rating a good half point or more if that was the version I chose to see as of this writing.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)",Iron Man

4027963,B001I1NGHY, AEQFYOI6YJ83Z,5.0, An ironclad action rom,"""Iron Man"" is good.  Damn good.  I'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (I've never been much of a comic book guy), though from what I've heard from my comic-reading friends, it is.  But I can tell you this: It is a good movie.  A good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.<br /><br />Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy.  He's a womanizer and a partier, who has a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, has a soft spot for him in return).  His company (created by his father, co-run by Obediah Stane) provides high-tech weaponry to the Army, and so Stark's best friend is an Army officer in charge of the Special Weapons Division.  Life is good...until, on a promotional trip in Afghanistan, something goes wrong.  Stark's motorcade is ambushed...mortally wounded, Stark is taken captive kept alive through the use of a magnet that is keeping some shrapnel from entering his heart.  The magnet gives him an idea...an idea for a suit...<br /><br />I had my doubts when I heard Robert Downey Jr. was cast in the role.  Don't get me wrong--I am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.  I was just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material.  Thank God, everyone else involved in making the movie was on the same page (I've heard that Downey apparently had a lot of say in various aspects of the film, and there was a lot of improvised dialogue).  Downey pulls it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else playing the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled Tony Stark.  Jeff Bridges is a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that I was at first convinced he was William Hurt (sorry, Jeff), I was absolutely captivated by his performance.  (And no offense to William Hurt, either, who could have pulled off the role; and will, to an extent, in ""The Incredible Hulk."")<br /><br />Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the primary cast, each bringing three-dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under-used).  The script is superb; the special-effects aren't anything we haven't seen, but are still top-notch (not ALL movies have to break new ground).  Both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let-down: the movie opens with AC/DC, and I sighed a little on my first viewing, thinking, ""Really?  You couldn't have come up with something a little less-cliched?""  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, things picked up.  And the ending...there was a lot of build-up, and the ending just left me feeling disappointed.  Of course, as good as the first two-thirds of the movie is, it's hard to beat that.  And then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will DEFINITELY be a sequel; and two, that Samuel L. Jackson really is in every movie ever made.<br /><br />So go see ""Iron Man.""  That's the gist of it.  There's definitely an anti-war point being made (from what I've heard, the comics did the same with the Vietnam War, so if anti-war stuff ain't your bag, blame the comic writers, not the filmmakers).  But overall, ""Iron Man"" is just a good time.  It's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.  And Stan Lee gets to play a pimp.  I mean, really now.  You have to go see it for that, if nothing else.",Iron Man
4027964,B001I1NGHY, A3F9VH8916IA40,5.0, I Am Iron Man,"Iron Man is simply one of the best. Forget the sorry excuses for movies that were Spider Man 3, or The Fantastic Four, forget all that nonsense. Iron Man stands with the best, a true revival for the super hero genera on par with the great super hero movies such as Spider Man 2 and Batman Begins. What a way to kick off the summer season that will also see long awaited films such as the new Indiana Jones movie, the second Batman film The Dark Night, and the redo of The Incredible Hulk.<br /><br />The film starts off with billionaire/genius weapons developer Tony Stark riding in the back of a Humvee in the Afghan desert, havening successfully impressed the military by blowing up a whole mountain with his new Jericho Missile. From the start of this film Tony is one of the MOST likable guys to ever grace the big screen. He's charming, smart, witty, funny, hardcore, and a bit of a ladies man. One memorable scene was when a girl Toney was with woke up in his house alone and found his personal assistance, Pepper Pots, with her dry-cleaning.<br />""Ten years and he still has you doing his dry cleaning?""<br />""I do anything he requires of me,"" Potts replies, ""even, occasionally, taking out the trash.""<br />As he eloquently puts it; ""They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire, well I respectfully disagree. I prefer the one you only have to fire once. That's how America does it, that's how my dad did it, and it's worked out pretty well so far."" Now tell me you wouldn't like to hang out with THAT guy.<br /><br />Unfortunately for our hero the Humvee he's riding comes under fire from Afghan rebels and he is taken hostage and forced to build one of his new weapons for his captures (after refusing of course and getting water boarded). But he has a few tricks up his sleeves and manages to escape by building, you guest it, an Iron Man.<br /><br />Far and away the best thing this movie accomplishes is creating likable characters who may not be as relatable as, say, Peter Parker, but who are definitely just as cool or sympathetic. As stated before, Tony Stark is the very definition of cool, but he isn't the only character who steals the show. His lady friend, oddly named Pepper Potts (okay, who was the genius who decided to name her Pepper Potts?) is perfect in her role as personal assistant/love interest with all her witty dialog and charm. The Afghan man Tony meets while in captivity is also a great contrast to Starks cocky and care free attitude; plus their conversations with one another are some of the best you'll see in a super hero movie, period.<br /><br />The only problem I had, and it's a small one, is that the action in this film was a little lacking. The escape from Afghanistan in the first Iran Man was great, and the battle between Iron Man and the Afghan militia later on was also incredible, but when it came to Iron Man VS really big Iron Man, the outcome was somewhat of a disappointment; the reason being that we never got to see both fighting at their best. One was always at a disadvantage during the whole fight. To see both go at it at their best would have been nothing short of amazing, unfortunately though we never got to see that.<br /><br />If you're a super hero movie fan then you HAVE to see this flick. Iron Man stands proud with the best in its genera and simply blows out of the water most badly made adoptions. Oh, and one more thing, if your willing to wait ten minutes for the credits to finish there is a thirty second scene at the end that may be worth seeing as it sets the stage for a sequel pretty well.<br /><br />Re-watch Value; VERY high.",Iron Man

I had this movie on DVD, but it was on sell at Walmart for 10 dollars on blu ray, so I picked out up along with The Avengers 3D blu ray, and if you haven't seen The Avengers yet be sure to do that, it is a can't miss movie. Back to Iron Man, the blu ray version looks very nice and was well worth the upgrade. I enjoy the story line of IM1 a little more than IM2. I am not saying IM2 is a bad movie, cause it is not, I just enjoyed seeing how Tony Stark progressed into Iron Man. The action in this movie is fantastic and the CGI is incredible! I think the CGI along with Downey's performance is what really makes this movie believable.

It turned out to be quite a bit more than that. There is some serious thematic material subtly woven in, for example the strength of the original heart. And our expectation about who the bad guys really are gets turned on its head.  I also really loved the chemistry between RDJ and Gwyneth Paltrow. They smoked in a beautifully understated way. All in all, I found it a very satisfying 2+ hours, me who is pretty much the polar opposite of a 12-year-old boy. (But fear not, there is plenty in the film to satisfy that heart as well.

The idea of man and technology merging to form the perfect enhanced being is a core issue. The underlying theme of continuously confronting one's limits to eventually overcome them combined with the archetype of the superhero is of equal value.

Robert Downey plays Iron Man with a great sense of humor and as Tony Stark the weapons magnate who is his alter ego.  The movie begins in Afghanistan and Tony Stark is held hostage and escapes by making a protective suit to ward off deadly weapons.  He perfects this suit into the Iron Man we know and love in the movie.  Pepper Pots is a great servant and a very pretty woman whom he ignores as often as he can.

4027996,B001I1NGHY, A26IVJJTXOE85B,5.0, One of the best,"Easily the best movie based on a Marvel character. Not only does it take the idea of a superhero into new territory, but it also manages to throw in everything lovable about the new found genre. Most of this movie's heart and charm is owed to Robert Downey Jr., who completely ownes the character in every way possible. The reason Iron Man has become a household name so suddenly is because it was acted so well and made as realistic as possible. It also takes the best parts of the source material and makes it into something familiar, but also new (much like Batman Begins). John Favreau managed to get down the comedy without making the movie become one. When this wants to be, it is a fantastic action movie with lots of great explosions and special effects. However, this also knows how to invest time in its characters and plot so we care about what will happen. The attention to detail is incredible.",Iron Man

4027999,B001I1NGHY, A25UZ7MA72SMKM,4.0, Fun and funny,"Robert Downey is quickly impressing me that he may be the most versatile actor of the past few years. When you compare this role with Sherlock Holmes and his performance in Tropic Thunder, you'll understand what I mean if you didn't immediately. All three roles are very different, yet he delivered them expertly, and with a combination of real drama and real humor in each of the three.<br /><br />In ""Iron Man"", he elevates what could have been just another comic book hero movie with his completely engaging performance. Let's face it, even tho I was a comic book fan, and like these movies, their numbers in recent years has approached overkill. The first Spiderman movie was revolutionary, but the next two were nothing more than continuations of the first. The first Hulk movie was wretched, and even tho the second was an improvement, Edward Norton didn't bring the personality to the character that Bill Bixby did in the TV series. The Fantastic Four was interesting but quickly forgotten The X-Men series was a cut above, and so was Iron Man.<br /><br />However, without Downey's performance Iron Man might have tanked as badly as the first Hulk. The story is nothing very surprising, and the ""surprise"" and ending are nothing but predictable. However, Downey's Tony Stark is alive. When he feels we feel. When he seduces a reporter, its all very natural and predatory. When he has troubles with the suit, his alarm infuses us as does the slapstick of his early mistakes. He is charming, infuriating, and at times completely blind to what is going on around him. All very human.<br /><br />I hold back one star because the story REALLY could have used a lot more imagination. Downey's performance almost hides that flaw ... almost.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",Iron Man

He has no special powers, just a really rockin' suit that kicks everyone else's butts. I never expect a superhero movie to be true to the comic... it's just not possible, but what I do expect is a quality product, a good story line, decent character development, and an ending that makes me want a sequel. This movie delivers all of those things. We see how the character of Tony Stark changes when he undergoes a traumatic event, loses the life of a friend, and has to engage with the betrayal of another friend. In all of this he grows as a person... and yet we see him struggle with how this affects his own personality. All of the while there are enough explosions, actions sequences, and high speed drama to keep me interested. I would give it 5 stars, but there were a few scenes that did drag for me.

Almost. While Iron Man may be an amazing film, it's worlds apart tonally from DC's The Dark Knight, an equally amazing film. Iron Man is flashy, witty and adventurous, whereas The Dark Knight is darker, grittier, and far more mature. Superhero fantasy film fans are really going to be split down the middle on this; I've come across quite a few people that claim Iron Man is the best comic book flick ever made while others insist The Dark Knight was an instant cinematic masterpiece with more substance. That's going to be up to all of you.<br /><br />Concerning acting, brilliant stuff, every single actor came strong and delivered their dialogue superbly! I think the only performance I wasn't thrilled with was Terrence Howard's; he just didn't pop for me, I'm almost glad to see him leave the sequel. He's a capable actor but I'm confident Don Cheadle will give Rhodes a new dimension and, hopefully, his alter-ego War Machine as well. Speaking of War Machine, the suit cameo looked awesome; you just know it's going to be pimped to the hilt in the next installment.<br /><br />This movie's CG was mesmerizing and production design was breathtaking, this is everything a good comic book fantasy film should be.

4028009,B001I1NGHY, AIMGHPI1AGVRF,5.0, Action-packed and witty,"One of the more highly-regarded superhero movies, I feel ""Iron Man"" deserves the acclaim. It has some excellent action sequences, but also balances them with a fair amount of drama. The dialogue is witty throughout and the story has a positive message. Each cast member delivers a superb performance, led by the reinvigorated Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.<br /><br />Taking over his father's company, Tony Stark is responsible for developing and selling modern weaponry to the United States government. While in Afghanistan to show off a new missile system, he is kidnapped by terrorists who want him to create the weapon for them. Instead, Tony creates his first Iron Man outfit. Seeing how the terrorists had been using some weapons created by his company to murder innocents, Tony has a change of heart over selling weaponry and wants the company to cease weapons selling. This doesn't sit well with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who takes care of the company's daily operations and ultimately opposes the change. Tony still goes one step further and develops a more advanced Iron Man outfit to go up against the terrorists.<br /><br />As for his personal life, Tony Stark is a playboy whose only real constant is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his personal assistant. It soon becomes clear just how much they care for each other. His only other real ally is Lt. Col. Rhodes (Terrence Howard), who helps bail Tony out. The scenes with Pepper and Rhodes include many of the better moments, both dramatic and humorous.<br /><br />This movie works well because the action is well-done without completely overshadowing the drama and humor.

4028021,B001I1NGHY, A8N5EM32PVLZJ,4.0, Ironman of the Spirit,"Okay, the film has been out for a while so I'll start with four obvious points.<br />1) The film is based on a Marvel comic and has been compared favorably with other comic book films; even the other comic `Man' films (`Super', `Bat' and `Spider'.) But an interesting difference between the hero in this film and the heroes of `Superman', `Batman' and `Spiderman' is that those heroes make great effort to avoid deadly force. Batman has a policy against using guns. Superman uses his great powers to jail rather than kill villains almost without fail. Spiderman's villains in the films die because of their own hubris rather than at Spidey's hand (or web or whatever). Iron Man has guns and missiles built into his suit that are intended to kill people, and he does that very thing. Keep that in mind if you're thinking of taking the young'uns. (If you want to know how I think it compares to the other superhero `Man' films, I've ranked them below.)<br />2) The cast is great. Gwyneth Paltrow takes the role of Pepper Potts, the loyal assistant that could have been a clich&eacute; and an offense to feminists, and makes the character into a charming blend of strength and vulnerability. Jeff Bridges ably projects ironic menace as Obadiah Stane. Terrance Howard is okay, but not nearly as interesting as he has been in other films. But it's all about the guy who plays Tony Stark, the man who becomes Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent in the film. He is the single best reason to buy a ticket. It's fun to see a forty-something year old not so chiseled hero (the power is in the suit). Downey plays the billionaire playboy munitions manufacturer as someone whose top concern is amusing himself. Downey has given similar top drawer performances in such films as last year's Zodiac or A Scanner Darkly from the year before that. But very few people saw those films. (Super hero films tend to be more popular than docudramas about serial killers or animated dystrophic science fiction.) In real life, Downey has struggled with abuse problems, and it's a pleasure to see him in such an entertaining breakout role.<br />3) This movie is making a lot of money. It made one hundred million dollars in its opening weekend alone. There has been a drought of exciting popcorn films in theaters, and many are rushing to see a film they hear is just plain fun.<br />4) You might want to stay past the final credits to get a hint of sequels to come.<br />As I said, all this has been written about before. So what can I add for the church newsletter? How about a ridiculous comparison to Scripture? Why not? If you can't write silly about a super hero film, what can you write silly about?<br />The first suit worn by Tony Stark in the film is built by the character in a cave in Afghanistan. He is being held hostage by terrorists who want him to build a missile system. He uses the materials system to build a mechanical suit that allows him to escape. When he returns home, he builds a bigger and better suit.<br />So let's take a look at how the armor of Iron Man compares to the armor of God described in Ephesians chapter 6.<br />10Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. 12For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.<br />Right off the bat, we get a big contrast between the two suits. Iron Man's armor is used to protect against flesh and blood. Though for PC reasons the film does not label the terrorists in the film as Muslim, they are quite obviously modeled after the Taliban. Tony Stark has no compunction about killing with bullets those who would kill him or innocent bystanders.<br />Paul makes it clear in this passage that our real enemies are not other people. Those people that seem to be our enemies have been deceived by the powers of darkness, and we must do our best to show love to people who strike out against us. (Note I am not saying here there is not a role for police officers and soldiers to use force to protect the innocent.) But we need to pray for and love those who ridicule Jesus Christ and His teaching, and not treat them as enemies.<br />Paul makes it clear that there are real evil spiritual forces in the world, Satan and his minions along with destructive philosophies and teaching. That is where the battle lies for a Christian.<br />14Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,<br />In the film, Stark runs a munitions company. When captured by terrorists he sees that they are using his company's weapons for nefarious ends. He then pursues the truth about how they obtained his weapons, knowing the exposure of the truth may have a great financial cost. As Christians, we need to pursue the truth, even if it is costly.<br />As the film begins, Tony Stark is definitely not a righteous man. We see he is a gambler, a heavy drinker and sexually promiscuous. But when a character in the film sacrifices his life for Stark, we see Stark realize that he should not live his life so selfishly. Because someone gave His life for us, we need to pursue righteousness.<br />15and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.<br />Stark's feet are equipped with rocket packs. But I'd argue that God's Spirit can get us where we need to go to share His good news faster and farther.<br />16In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.<br />Stark's whole suit is a shield. His basic power is invulnerability. We have the armor of God, which will not necessarily protect us from illness or pain or poverty. But if we trust Him, it will protect us from the flaming arrows of the evil one that would have eternal, damning consequences.<br />17Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.<br />Stark uses all kinds of offensive weaponry. He has all kinds of guns and missiles and his very armor acts as a weapon. But the sword is the only offensive weapon in God's arsenal. We need to get to know the Bible, the Word of God, well. It's the only weapon of God we have. And all we need.<br />18And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.<br />Iron Man pretty much fights alone. We, like a real army, need the support of others. We need the prayers of our fellow believers. And we need to pray for them.<br />The kid in me watches Iron Man and thinks, ""I wish I had a suit like that."" But the Spirit in me says, ""You have something better.""<br />(Iron Man is rated PG-13 for violence, sensuality and language.)<br />[How Iron Man compares to the Superman, Batman and Spiderman films.<br />1) On par with Superman, not at good as Superman II, but far better than the horrible Superman III and Superman IV and the mediocre Superman Returns.<br />2) Better than Batman (1966), Batman (1989) and far better than the wretched Batman Returns, Batman Forever and worst of all Batman and Robin. It's not as good as Batman Begins and the jury's still out on The Dark Knight with Christian Bale and Heath Ledger, which will be released July 18th.<br />3) On par with Spiderman, not as good as Spiderman II and far better than Spiderman III.]",Iron Man

But coming from Batman, Ironman is the closest thing in the Marvel Universe. There isnt much that I like in the Marvel Universe, but Ironman is definitely the top spot for me, and its all due to this movie! I think Robert Downey was the perfect choice for Tony Stark, and John Favreau did a great job directing. There are probably gonna be those that say, ""it wasn't true to the comic"" waaaa waaa, blah blah blah, who gives a crap! I never read comic book ONE with a marvel title, so the idea of creating these films is to attract people like myself, as well as quell the fans. I think this film did both very well.<br /><br />As far as the product itself, it has a great amount of extras! I have yet to listen to the commentary, but I expect good things<br /><br />All in all, it's now made me buy the Civil War series of comics related to this character, so it's worth it on all levels. ""Then why not give it 5 stars"", you ask? Because I'm a stingy bastard! How's that?",Iron Man

4028024,B001I1NGHY, A34GZPHWYPSY2T,5.0, You've caught me doing worse things,"So good to drop in long after the 1st-timer reviews, on a really enjoyable film that I've only just seen. Not just that: today's crummy offerings (mostly involving silly brainless teens falling into comic books or video-/Hasbro-based schlock) suck beyond all recognition. That is why IRON MAN takes the prize in my book.<br /><br />As most of my generation and the following two, I grew up reading comics. Of all, Marvel Comics were my favorites. It is a thrill each time a Marvel character is done justice. In IRON MAN, nothing disappoints. In spite of today's grand cine-tech, this is a seamless, superbly executed work of art.<br /><br />Featuring the dramedy-slapstick talents of Robert Downey, a growling villain in the form of Jeff Bridges, we have as a perfect spice the support of Gwyneth Paltrow and Terence Howard. This film will show you what ""supporting role"" is supposed to mean.<br /><br />Though there are multinational (presumably Muslim) terrorists, who give Tony Stark his Iron Man initiative, this film is lighthearted, fun, never overbearing and funny as hell. Thanks to this, Downey got offered Sherlock Holmes, and IRON MAN really is his 'comeback'. He reins in Tony Stark's pathos and gives us a strong, determined man who is not afraid to grow. Jeff Bridges' villain shows the opposite side of that coin brilliantly.<br /><br />I loved hearing Paul Bettany's sexy voice as Stark's computer Jervis, and the inventions, gadgetry, even weapons were a fantastic treat. When I think of the hatchet job done by Christian Bale to BATMAN....<br /><br />Here, IRON MAN is overtly political but not in any patronizing, annoying way. Stan Lee has always been 'political' marching to his own drummer's beat, and this movie reflects that better than any other I've seen so far. Political can only take you so far: the rest had better be entertaining and just plain good. And IRON MAN IS GOOD!!<br /><br />Now that its sequel is floating around, get and enjoy this unique film. There are explosions, but everything looks and feels so new here. That is a level of skill I just don't see anymore. Samuel L. Jackson gives the perfect ""this-is-about-to-get-big"" cameo at the end, and I nearly jumped out of my seat at that promise--which I can only hope has been delivered as well as this delivered.<br /><br />IRON MAN will be a classic, mark my words.",Iron Man

It's a very character-driven movie, which sets it apart from your average run-of-the-mill action flicks. Downey is charming and absolutely perfectly cast in this role, and he has amazing chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays Stark's assistance/platonic love interest, Pepper.

4028041,B001I1NGHY, A1WD8PRZ5VQCS0,4.0, Fantastic Blu Ray Transfer!,"Wow!! What a great Blu Ray transfer!  I'll get to that in a minute, I want to talk about the movie.<br /><br />What a fantastic movie! I didn't know anything about Iron Man, and didn't know what to expect. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did!  This movie has some very nice plot twists that will keep the viewer engaged.<br /><br />The movie is about a super smart guy, Tony Stark, who has enough money to be the typical playboy. He has a solid work ethic that has abled him to live the life that he lives and love so much.<br /><br />He's in Afghanistan taking a joy ride with the US Tropps, when all of a sudden his  humvee  his hit with weapons, weapons that he and his company made. He's taken POW and the baddies want him to make his super secret, super nasty weapon for themselves.  He works pretty much by himself (he has a couple of people helping him) by he's not making the weapon, but making a crude ""iron man"" to make his escape. He does that, then when he's back home he decides to close down the weapons part of his business. Not everyone is pleased. Tony then take all of his drive and energy and makes ""Iron Man"" and uses it against the people that held him hostage. Again, not everyone in the US Government is happy with him.  That's all I really want to say on the plot.<br /><br />This movie has a lot of strengths to it.  I love the way Downey has portrayed Tony Stark.  He gives Stark a lot of charm and depth that we can't help to love.  I honestly didn't think that Downey could pull of the character of Tony Stark, and I'm pleased to say that I was wrong. Downey does a fantastic job!<br /><br />This has some pretty neat plot twists. I don't want to say what they are, but they're very nice and will keep you glued to the movie.<br /><br />The Blu Ray is fantastic! The transfer is beautiful.  It has crystal clear images and very life like. A few times I was floored by what I saw. It was that good. The sound is outstanding. It will give the viewer the experience as if they're really there. Nice job. I loved all of the extras to it.<br /><br />****SPOILER START*****<br /><br />There is just one thing that keeps me from giving Iron Man 5 stars. It's the ending. I really didn't like it at all. I mean, Stark told the media, ""I am Iron Man."" What?!  Why would he do that? He had someone write for him some alibis to prove he wasn't where Iron Man was. It was all set, so why would he tell who he really is? I was just stunned by what he did.<br /><br />****SPOILER END*****<br /><br />Over all, I'd say get this movie and add it to your blu ray collection. It has great visuals, great sound, great extras, wonderful story and  a great plot.  You need to add this to your collection. I can promise you, you won't be sorry. I know I wasn't.",Iron Man

4028043,B001I1NGHY, A4RBWH5IMQBXZ,5.0, Iron Man is one of the better superhero movies out there.,"2008 gave us three excellent superhero films: The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk.....and Iron Man. Director Jon Favreau truly did his homework while researching Marvel Comics' high flying superhero, and it shows. I think i was one of the very few who thought it would be tragic if there were missteps to putting Iron Man to the big screen. I mean, for every Spiderman or X-Men 2, theres a Ghost Rider or original Punisher. But Favreau understood the appeal and complexities of billionaire Tony Stark, and took what was considered by some to be a second tier character and gave him three dimensional authenticity.<br /><br />For starters, lets not forget Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, who created Iron Man in ""Tales of Suspense # 39"" in the early 60s. Theirs is the blueprint from which this film sprang. It is soooo faithful to the origin of the character, despite modernizing certain elements, which i was totally fine with, since it made total sense: Instead of Vietnam, we see Stark captured in Afghanistan. Instead of a jungle warlord, we have members of a Taliban-type organization, yet the weapons manufacturing angle remains intact. We see Stark's interaction and subsequent friendship with fellow inventor/prisoner Yinsen, well played by Grant Toub. The moment when Stark creates and puts on his original, bulky silver suit of armor had me grinning from ear to ear, blasting his way from captivity<br /><br />As he returns to America, Stark, who was a munitions manufacturer for the U.S. military, decides to change his views on weapons of war and instead use his gifts to battle those who threaten the oppressed, here as well as overseas.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr is the engine that drives this film from beginning to end, and hes brilliant. Anyone who knows the character of Stark from the comic books knows hes an at times arrogant, shallow playboy who enjoys his drink and his women. Downey has him down pat and his transformation from selfish, wealthy jerk to a slowly caring humanitarian/hero is peppered with humor and wit. The times we see him designing his suits of armor, through trial and error, mostly error, are funny, yet we see the human being in him with a newfound cause, and the moment in the film when he travels back to Afghanistan, as Iron Man, and wages war on his former captors as they terrorize innocent villagers, will make you jump up and down.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, one of my favorite actors of all time, plays Obediah Stane, who runs Stark Industries with Tony and acts as father figure to our hero until we discover his true nature and motivations concerning continuing their weapons division. He's a great bad guy. Even Gwyneth Paltrow delivers fun work as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant. This is the only time i can say i enjoyed watching her on screen, and shes actually fun to watch in her playful interactions with Downey.<br /><br />Tight direction from Favreau, a great screenplay, excellent special effects and a fun, multi-faceted performance from the multi-talented Downey makes ""Iron Man"" one of the better superhero adaptations to come along in a while.<br />Loved it.",Iron Man

4028055,B001I1NGHY, AGEIT17HENDIS,4.0," Turning Swords Into Ploughshares, Oops! ....Iron Men","In the normal course of my work in this space I don't generally review current commercial films, except when they provide some kind of political or social comment that is in line with those aims. Or when I am feeling a little whimsical or wicked after watching a ""light"" film that is just pure entertainment. That turns out to be the case here.<br /><br />Let's face it, how can one seriously knock a film that is based on a comic book character?  Reading about or viewing such characters was virtually a rite of passage for any child, right? Here whiz kid (or elder kid) and mega-rich defense contractor Tony Stark, played very nicely by Robert Downey, Jr., just happens to have had a ""conversion"" experience in of all places, modern day Afghanistan (if one can accept that as a correct term in that benighted country) as a result of a very close call with the results of his own weaponry at the hands of a Taliban-like organization.<br /><br />As a result, Brother Stark will not, however,  `go gentle into that good night' and begin to preach some form of pacifism but will turn the nature of modern nasty and brutish  combat on its head and return, via high technology, to the good old medieval days of individual knightly combat. One on one, up close and personal.  Needless to say, that knight will be none other than the whiz kid Stark. Throw in a little off-hand old-fashioned chaste romance with his fair damsel, oops, Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) and you have the makings of a very good...comic book story. Kudos for that part.<br /><br />No kudos, however, for the little premise that was always behind these super-hero adventure stories. Wait on an individual `savior"" to come by and save us from ourselves. If we wait for the ""white knight"" to come and save us from this wicked old world we are in serious trouble. Although this film was fun to watch and a nice spoof I'll stick with the mass plebeian struggle to turn those swords into ploughshares. And by the way, individual knight or massed troops isn't it about time to get out, way out, of Afghanistan now. The comic books, and their very appealing characters, are of no use for use on that proposition though.",Iron Man
4028056,B001I1NGHY, A1KNKSP8BNX4J4,4.0, Brilliant remake for a cold war character,"Ironman is one of Marvel Comics characters that has been around at least in comic form since the early 1960's.  Something attested to by the fact that I had one conversation about this movie while attending a function at a church related retirement community.  When I heard that this movie was being made, I wondered how the film's producers would take a character who was a munitions maker and a superhero and put him on the big screen.  What if public opinion about the current wars became overwhelmingly negative before the movie's release?  In the comics the line was tread by having Tony Stark become an alchoholic during the heavy military expeditures of the 1980's but this was to be a two hour movie. For this movie, Ironman's origin was altered.  This time Tony Stark is injured by one of his own weapons, an idea borrowed from the comicbook origin of the Incredible Hulk.  The metal suit he develops is intended to be a less lethal method of stopping violent terrorists.  After returning to America he shifts Stark Industries away from the production of weapons.  The antagonist is now a war profiteer in his own company. There is just the right amount of comic relief and although some modifications have been made to the Ironman mythos, the story remains true to the spirit of Marvel Comics.<br />Since this movie is deservedly rated PG-13, a version for younger audiences would nice for parents.",Iron Man

4028063,B001I1NGHY, A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,5.0, More Than Just Heavy Metal Noise,"When Marvel and Paramount first started promoting ""Iron Man,"" I expected it to be nothing more than CGI sequence after CGI sequence showing you just how far FX have come.  With Black Sabbath's song of the same name pumping up the viewer, it looked like just another empty action film.  Wow, what a nice surprise to walk out of the theater feeling as if I'd just witnessed a solid drama interspersed with excellent FX and action sequences.  Robert Downey, Jr. makes the lead role of Tony Stark/Iron Man his own.  Much like Michael Keaton when he suited up as Batman, I admit that I had my doubts when it was revealed that Downey, Jr. would head up this film.  Instead, Tony Stark comes across as one of the most believable characters to grace a comic book film adaptation.  He's a jerk, highly intelligent and self-centered.  When a life-changing (and almost life-taking) incident occurs, he returns to his home as a new man hoping to right the wrongs that his company has done for so many years.  Being a comic book film, naturally, a villain steps up to put a stop to Stark for both financial and egotistical gains.  The result is an all-out slugfest sure to please even the harshest critic.<br /><br />The cast is solid, from Terrence Howard as Rhodes to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.  Jeff Bridges gives an excellent performance as Obadiah Stane, Stark's primary business associate in the weapons business.<br /><br />The actual suit(s) that make up Iron Man and his enemy look great on the screen.  The action sequences are brilliant, especially one involving civilian traffic.  Another highlight is Stark's home, which gives the Batcave a run for its money as far as gadgets go.<br /><br />Even though the FX are notched up quite a bit, they take a step back to the plot.  This is one of the most character-driven comic adaptations to hit the screen in a long time.  Perhaps it's the quality of the cast or the direction of Jon Favreau or a combination of both, but this story just doesn't feel like an ordinary comic book film.  The story is interesting, funny at just the right times, and never falls back on action or FX to bail out a scene.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is a very, very good film.  It's a comic book adaptation that doesn't feel or act like a comic book adaptation.  Despite the bright red and gold armor, you'll find yourself more concerned with the man inside of the suit.  That makes a good film in my book.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is necessary.  There's a tad bit of language and one swift roll in the hay between two characters.  The action is explosive, literally, and some younger kids may be put off by a few of the deaths in the film.  If you do have younger children who want to see this film (and I'm sure there are plenty), I think that a nine or ten year-old could view this with a little guidance from mom and dad.<br /><br />Highly recommended and hopefully a sign of things to come this summer film season.  Also, like everybody else seems to be warning, make sure to sit through the entire credits for a brief hint at ""Iron Man 2"" or perhaps an entirely new film that'll make fanboys jump with glee.",Iron Man
4028064,B001I1NGHY, AFFVUZEGP1FDQ,4.0, Excellent!,"Cool. That is one word that describes this movie. Exciting and fun are another two. Robert Downey Jr. was nothing but excellent at playing Iron Man. He exhibited wit, intelligence, that playboy charm and charisma: the works for a superhero. Although the plot was not strong, and there were a few holes or weak areas, the movie was excellent. But, the plot did not matter that much. This is an origin story and it was all about the characters, they are the ones that move the story forward.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was one cold blooded arms dealer, and he was great at it. I just wish we would have seen more of him. Terrence Howard was ok, not the best part of the movie. Paltrow was cute in her very capable performance. But the story centered around Tony Stark and Iron Man, and it was good. The action sequences and the special effects were excellent but did not dominate the film, which I was grateful form.<br /><br />This movie managed what many movies have not been able to do: balance. The action and special effects are enough to keep the movie going and highly entertaining, but the character development is what drives it forward, what gives it form and meaning.

4028066,B001I1NGHY, A39460B1F5HGSS,5.0, Breaking the Mold,"In a decade of interchangable superhero movies desperately trying to enter the Superhero Pantheon, Iron Man is the only one that succeeds in breaking the wanna-be mold and becomes truly fresh and worthwhile. It mixes just the right amount of real world injustice and superhero magic.<br /><br />The movie never takes itself to seriously and so never becomes too heavy handed or bogged down in psychology. It never becomes too slapstick, and Downey Jr.'s remarkable performance brings to life both the bitterness that makes Tony Stark a believable human being and the fortitude that leads him to make himself into Iron Man.<br /><br />Stark doesn't care what anyone thinks of him; he's a playboy/weapons mogul who fights injustice because it offends him personally and follows the rules of no other superhero code. Iron Man, too, follows the rules of no other superhero movie; it leaves the impression that the filmmakers did it solely to please themselves, disregarding what the studio or fanboy expect and ""Iron Man movie"" to be.<br /><br />And that's what makes it great. Now if only they could continue to ignore precedent and continue the stellar work in the inevitable sequel.",Iron Man
4028067,B001I1NGHY, A3KKM0T1KY42HA,5.0, For the Future of Mankind,"What makes Iron Man a great movie is that it is virtually void of those moments where you go, ""That could never happen."" And that's saying a lot for a movie about a guy that creates an ""iron"" suit that is not only a lean mean fighting machine, but also gives Tony Stark the ability to fly.<br /><br />I've seen comparisons between the detail and...well...just plain awesomeness that was abundant in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PC6A3E"">Batman Begins</a> and Iron Man. And that comparison would not be incorrect. While I'd agree that both had great action and made viewers believe that these superheros actually existed, Batman Begins was more dark while Iron Man kept you giggling at Tony Stark's wise-guy personality...which is true to the comic book versions of the characters.<br /><br />And who better to be in the role of a wise-guy than Robert Downey, Jr. Man, did he nail the role of Stark! And the rest of the cast and acting in the movie were terrific.<br /><br />Iron Man takes you from Stark's creation of the gold-titanium-alloy suit to his confrontation with those that would see Stark Industries commit treason. There's plenty of action and tons of visual candy. The story is well-written for the screen and the directing will probably put Jon Favreau in the sought-after category.<br /><br />The good news is that Iron Man will be back, but in what capacity is the question. It's well known that Stark (Downey, Jr) has a cameo in 2008's The Incredible Hulk. And it's rumored that the actors in Iron Man have all signed on for two sequels (at the time of this writing Director Favreau has not). But will Iron Man's return be solo, or perhaps with some of his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785110828"">Avenging</a> buddies? Either way...I can't wait.<br /><br />I will definitely pick up Iron Man for my collection. I don't know about the theaters in your area, but the theaters in mine don't even come close to the picture and sound quality that I get from my home theater. I'm not bragging; I'm just saying that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00168ML1G"">Iron Man</a> will be a movie that goes into my Blu Ray player the day it's released.",Iron Man
4028068,B001I1NGHY, A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5,5.0, Both my spouse and I had a blast from start to finish,"I believe one of the best things to happen to the big screen was when they started filming Marvel Comics. Honestly, I'll go see an action-adventure or science fiction fantasy film on the big screen over any other genre. And the Marvel classics translate very well to film, particularly if you have a writer like Peter David doing the novelization.<br /><br />The story in brief:  when Star Industries CEO and wunderkind engineer Tony Stark (Downey, Jr) is kidnapped by terrorists, he builds an Iron Man suit to escape rather than creating the missile they demanded.<br /><br />Back at home, he decides to convert Stark into a more politically correct company and 'make peace instead of war.'  He hadn't reckoned with the terrorists re-arming and deceit from his own camp.<br /><br />The acting's great. I think Terrence Howard (Colonel Rhodes) is going to be the next Denzel Washington.  He's a good actor and easy on the eyes. Jeff Bridges broke out of type and served as a pretty amazing Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />The imagery is fabulous. Scenes from Stark's capture were gripping.  His fellow captive, Yinsen (played by Shaun Toub) was an interesting and sad character, such a waste of a brilliant man.<br /><br />The soundtrack is particularly good with strong, evocative musical images. Okay, I wish they'd used Black Sabbath's version of ""Iron Man"" for the soundtrack, but that's already been used by both ""Detroit Rock City"" and ""Lords of Dogtown.""<br /><br />Best of all, for a vertigo sufferer like me, there was minimal monkey cam.  I could follow almost all the action without a problem.  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ""Iron Man"" and may well see the film again before it leaves the big screen.",Iron Man

During one day in Afghanistan, he demonstrates for a group of U.S. soldiers a different kind of weapon that works successfully and gets kidnapped by terrorists as he's held captive and forced to make the weapons for them. Instead he uses his brilliant brains and creates a special armour-suit that helps him escape from hell and is sent back to the U.S., of course his friend Obadia (Jeff Bridges) wants to take over the corporation for himself and makes a deadly conspiracy. Thus Stark creates a more advanced, industructable and more powerful suit that makes him into ""Iron Man"" in which he serves to protect the innocent and fight evil.<br /><br />Intelligent, exciting and thrilling sci-fi actioner is based on a Marvel Comic Book and is the first great comic book movie of the year next to ""Dark Knight"". Gwyneth Palthrow co-stars as Stark's sexy secretary Pepper Potts and Terrence Howard as Colnel Rhodes, it's the greatest Marvel Movie since ""X2"" or ""Spider-Man 2"". Downy Jr. definitely nailed the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man well just like Christopher Reeve was to Superman, Tobey Mcguire to Spider-Man and Christian Bale was to Batman. Jeff Bridges made a belivable and excellent villain here in this motion picture, the special effects by ILM and Stan Winston are just outstanding including the acting.

4028070,B001I1NGHY, A37T4NN3DV3U75,5.0, From Obscurity to a household name.,"When I first saw the previews of this movie I was a skeptic.  Iron Man was not a household name like Batman or Superman and to be honest I knew very little about the character.  Some might even say he was a ""B List"" Super Hero as his own adventures never took off very well and he tended to be bundled with other heroes instead of having a long running series of his own.<br /><br />However this movie just blows those notion away and if they keep at it not only will this be a great franchise for future movies but my guess it will re-kindle the comic book market for this hero as well.<br /><br />The studio could have taken the easy way out and done this movie as a cheesy action movie with a thin plot which would make for a great summer blockbuster but be easy to be forgotten over time.  Instead they went all out with a rock solid plot that is real, gritty, and believable.  There is a movie here with action, and not just a bunch of action scenes made into a movie (ie Transformers).<br /><br />The casting was right on and the actors did a great job bringing the characters to life.  Downey just nails the part in every way.  I have never been a fan of his actually as he has always irritated me but he has redeemed himself in Iron Man and I totally rooted for his character.  Everyone else from major parts to even the smaller parts did a wonderful job.<br /><br />The art work and effects were also just amazing.  The attention to detail just blows my mind.  The suit in particular and how he puts it on made perfect sense and it was great to share the joy of his discoveries with Iron Man.  A lot of movies skip this part and show something bad happening to the main character and then a short 'build sceen' that makes no sense and then they emerge all decked out.  The older Batman movies come to mind where he has all this super tech but no way to explain any of it.  Iron Man explains it so it makes sense and takes you on the journey to building it all and testing through the kinks of the system and its limitations.<br /><br />Being that this movie was so wonderful with such great special effects and attention to detail, I ended up 'upgrading' to the Blu Ray version.  The Blu Ray difference stuck out soooo much on this already good looking movie.  The level of detail on the suit in particular just made me constantly say ""WOW'.  The Blu Ray brought this movie to the next level with sight and sounds along with having a ton of great extra features that my DVD did not have.<br /><br />In the end I highly recommend this movie to anyone as it is one of my favorite movies now.",Iron Man

It feels like an incomplete film.  It seems like it's mostly exposition.  By the time the flick really heats up it's over.

As soon as I saw it, I knew I'd buy the dvd. My husband and both boys love it now, and I think it's my favorite action movie, and certainly my favorite superhero movie (because I don't like any other superhero movies).

From beginning to the end credits (and you really have got to wait til the end of the credits or you miss the zinger) this is a really good movie. Not great, but really good. As for the DVD, that's another matter. I was hoping this movie would come in fullscreen like The Dark Knight, The fantastic Four, and other movies where you either bought it fullscreen or as in some cases, you got a disc with widescreen on one side and fullscreen on the other.<br /><br />Too much of the good stuff gets cut out with widescreen, And I don't know why these companies assume that everyone can afford-- or will even buy a wide screen TV if they could afford it-- and so make movies in only one limited format. Iron Man is already in Blu Ray, so why not fullscreen as well? Then you would have a five star DVD to watch!",Iron Man

4028080,B001I1NGHY, A3D8PZLWX73N3W,4.0," Great example of Blue Ray, good example of a film","With the price of Blue Ray discs so high I have found myself renting more than buying but there are a few titles out there whose rental convinces me that they are worth spending a little extra. Ironman is an excellent example of the power of blue ray, an extremely polished film and one that looks absolutely stunning on Blue Ray.<br /><br />As a movie I have found myself rewatching the first hour more than the second. As with any comic book origin story you learn where the hero comes from, what pushes him to risking his life for others, and a little about where he is going. The interesting thing with this film is that it is far stronger in its early stages when we are learning these facets of our hero than it is after the hero has been constructed (literally in this case). It almost feels as though once the premise is all in place the writers were not really sure what to do with him so they fabricated a quick enemy for him to fight. As an origin story though it is very engaging.<br /><br />So after we have discovered the why and the who behind our superhero there needs to be a super villain standing in opposition and this is where I think the movie falters a little. I got a trifle bored in the last quarter of the movie once the villain of the piece has been revealed. I almost wish they had have ended the story after the origin part was over and spent more time in a sequal on setting up a major villain.<br /><br />Here is hoping that ironman 2 gives us a more convincing nemesis.",Iron Man

4028103,B001I1NGHY, A1VS9MWZRZ618V,4.0," 2008, a good year for comic fans","So, this was the movie that begun the summer season on 2008 and boy, it started with a bang. Iron Man collected more than 300 million USD just in North America and was praides almost universally.<br /><br />And with good reason, Iron Man is a very solid film, a proyect that in paper, in 2007 was secondary to other Marvel franchises, as Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4 or X-Men. Today, i belive that with SpiderMan, it must be the good looking son in hearts of Marvel Excecutives.<br /><br />Directed in a very fresh way by Jon Favreau, Iron Man is a movie that took a very serious approach (serious, not dark) to it's source material. Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice as Tony Stark and embodies it with masterful audacity. he embodies the character and elevates it to the real world.<br /><br />the other members of the cast do ggod jobs from what they have to work, but from the script, they are secondary to Stark, who fills the screen for 95% of the film.<br /><br />I belive that the reviews should be done at the moment of the first seeing, (to measure first impact) and also after several viewings, because you can discover new details every watch, and after 5 or 6 times, a whole different picture might emerge. i can say that after multiple viewings, Iron Man is a solid, appealing and well excecuted piece of entertaining, but no perfect. Tha main problem with the film is the lack of an enemy that is in the same tone with the rest of the film, very similar to what hurted Batman Begins: in the last portion of the film, the to-that-moment-realistic and belivable, villain says bye bye to the real context of the movie and says hello to super-villain Mountain. I think that with a more serious and realistic nemesis, Iron Man could be in the League of The Dark Knight, Spider Man 2 or X Men 2 as the best the genere has to offer.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a very good movie, and another proof that Comic Book Movies are really what are holding Hollywood Economy in relative order...just see the top ten box-office movies, and count how many are from a genere that were once only for kids and geeks, but in the last 10 or 20 years, it has gained the respect of the most talented filmakers, and specially, of the adult audience all around the world.",Iron Man
4028104,B001I1NGHY, AWRGM17GTMND8,4.0, We All Are Waiting For the Sequel,"Iron Man was a great success for Marvel.  It continues the super-hero genre, with great creativity and humor.  I would have never thought that Jon Favreau could take on a Marvel franchise and be so successful.  This new string of Marvel financed movies are turning out to be great adaptations.  You're gonna love Downey Jr. as Iron Man, and your going to love the action and adventure.<br /><br />Iron Man has a lot of great things that will carry it through a big franchise.  Its humor draws a big audience.  It's technological action, with a strong reality wired in, appeases many skeptics and comic bookies alike.  The film has a strong cast which recently went through some changes for the sequel, but I'm sure it will turn out for the better.  Its adaptation from comic to film is very similar to Batman's recent treatment, with a focused concentration on making the character believable.  In any comic book adaptation, I believe you really have to convince the audience that this person would do this.<br /><br />Besides the great film, the Blu-ray carries a lot of great special features.  I enjoy blocks of video and some picture-in-picture but I dislike Universal's attempt at the rewind, click, rewind, click U-Control.  I was very satisfied by Iron Man's behind the scenes peeks.<br /><br />To pump you up for the sequel I would say this movie is definately one of those comic book movies you should own.  Behind the helmet, and outside of the helmet, Robert Downey Jr. does amazing justice to the character. I wanted a little more action, but that's what a sequel is for.  Get ready for Iron Man Vs. Mickey Rourke!",Iron Man
4028105,B001I1NGHY, A3USRUCHAOC3MT,5.0, Very enjoyable superhero movie,"When I was a teenager, I read both Marvel and DC Comics.  My favorite heroes were respectively Iron Man and Batman.  I have yet to see Dark Knight yet, but from what I hear, Iron Man is the more positive, feel good side.<br /><br />The best summer movies are ones that wow you with special effects but also have performances that captivate you, and this one has that.  Sometimes a movie is overloaded with star power to draw you in; with this movie, the stars were selected because of their talent.  When I saw this movie in the theater, the only actor I expected to see was Robert Downey, who was as good as the film critics said he was.  Believe it or not, I didn't recognize Gwyneth Paltrow, though she caught my attention with her excellent performance of Pepper Potts.<br /><br />In the novel ""Moonraker"" by Ian Fleming, the villain told James Bond that if a man is bald and grows a mustache, even his mother wouldn't recognize him.  What does that have to do with ""Iron Man""?  Jeff Bridges proves the point in this movie.  I did not recognize one of my favorite actors.  Again, his talent gave life to the role of Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />I have, as I grew up, stopped keeping up with the comics though I am usually interested in the Marvel movies.  When I was a teenager, Tony Stark was captured and became Iron Man in Vietnam.  I learned that the story changed twice since then, and the movie follows the current version of Iron Man's origin.<br /><br />This movie can be considered a little slow in its development.  The real action is at the beginning and towards the end.  This is where the casting helped pull the movie off, because I was kept interested by the portrayals of the actors.<br /><br />Of course, Stan Lee makes a cameo.  There were a couple of hints of what might come in a sequel (Terrence Howard's character eyeing an armor suit and the mention of SHIELD) that would leave a non-Marvel fan scratching his head and wondering what that was about, which I felt was a chink in the armor of this movie.  Also, I felt the movie sputtered in its final minutes.  (The editorial review loved the ending -- I didn't.)  These negative elements won't stop you from enjoying the movie.",Iron Man

You can see just how much he enjoys himself as the playboy rich kid Tony Stark riding in a tank in the middle of a war zone, enjoying a drink and joking with the soldiers. You can't help but wonder how many of the lines were adlibbed by Downey because the ease with which he delivers his lines is just too perfect. Gwyneth Paltrow is refreshing as Stark's assistant. While Paltrow has presented herself as a serious (dare I say pretentious?) actress in the past, she seems to relax and allow herself to enjoy the film. Her red hair helps to downplay her natural beauty allowing her to carry herself as a slightly mousy woman in comparison to the supermodels her boss usually brings home.

Taking control of the company after his father's death, Tony, along with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) continue to manufacture different types of military weapons systems.  Their newest system is the Jericho missile, and Tony is on a mission to Afghanistan to show off the system to the military brass.<br /><br />After the demonstration, Tony hops in a Humvee.  He's talking with the others in the Humvee when suddenly, the convoy comes under fire.  Tony is eventually captured by rebels and hidden away.  He is told that, in order to be released, he must build a Jericho system for the reigning warlord.  However, Tony has something else in mind.  He instead begins construction of an iron suit.  Once completed, Tony blasts his way out of captivity.  He's finally rescued, but he's forced to leave his damaged suit behind.<br /><br />Upon returning to the U.S., Tony decides to stop all production of military weapons, much to the amazement of his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Obadiah.  Instead, Tony works on perfecting his Iron Man suit.  He even returns to the Middle East to clean up some unfinished business.  Meanwhile, Tony's company has suffered huge monetary losses due to his decision to stop military production.  As it turns out, Obadiah has had secret dealings with the Middle Easterners and is still trying to funnel arms to them.<br /><br />In the end, Tony discovers that Obadiah has betrayed him and has managed to build his own suit.  There is a huge confrontation between Tony and Obadiah, and only one will survive.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges all give first-rate performances.  The special effects are great, and there's even a little comedy thrown in, too.

4028129,B001I1NGHY, ANSQVDQ9BTI8O,5.0, The best movie of the year!!,"Hands down, the best movie of the year!!!<br />Clean but very exciting, kinda like the Bourne movies.",Iron Man
4028130,B001I1NGHY, A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,4.0, The way action movies should be done,"Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age).  A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion.  He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a ""merchant of death,"" but he balks at being called ""the Da Vinci of our time"").  Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity.  Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and pulverizing the bad guys.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards.  But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time.  He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made ""Iron Man"" what it is without him.  Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory.  These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen.  James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.<br /><br />Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in ""Iron Man"" - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie.  It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film.  And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be.  It's nice to see that somebody finally got it right.",Iron Man

This is not your typical super hero movie, it's better.  Perhaps because the story of Iron Man as told in the comic books has more pragmatic beginnings, this movie is believable.  Excellent acting all around, excellent use of humor.  I've purchased it for gifts for my master stylist (who also loved it), and my brother (who turned me on to the 'bad' comic books like Iron Man and Batman when I was into the 'good' comics like Tweety and Slyvester).

What I will say is that this Blu-Ray edition does a good job of bringing the feeling of the big screen at home.  The video is very clear provided you are using high def, and the sound track is very cool for those who have multi-speaker systems.  Using the PCM stream, you can appreciate individual bullets in different areas and some more subtle sounds during the battle sequences that you may not have noticed.  This movie is probably one of my favorites to show off sound effects.  All in all a very nice way to enjoy your home theater and a fun movie to watch.",Iron Man

4028160,B001I1NGHY, AWPODHOB4GFWL,5.0, 2-Disc Set Does Iron Man Justice!,"There is a lot to `give away' in describing ""Iron Man', but suffice it to say that the film makers have created the real Tony Stark.  He is the rowdy billionaire responsible for building weapons of mass destruction and selling them to the enemy who then turns into a reluctant and then powerful `Iron Man'.  The cinematography is stunning in Blu-ray and the scenes starting from Afghanistan to Los Angeles's skies are over-whelming.  The action is intense, funny, witty and true to the character of the comic book character.  Plus, it is all believable.  Robert Downing, Jr. playing around with his Iron Man invention is nothing short of hilarious and thrilling.  Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit underused as his assistant, but she supplies some killer one-liners.  Jeff Bridges plays a role that truly threatens Iron Man, but that's all I'll say.  The effects are fantastic, the storyline is fast and clever and it is no small wonder it broke box office records.  On Blu-ray disc, it is just as good as being in a movie theater - the details, color and sound are that amazing!  Tony Stark IS `Iron Man'.<br /><br />All Blu-ray discs are set up differently according to their theme, but for Iron Man, I'll describe the screen imagery.  The initial PLAY/SCENES board is a colorful statue of Iron Man with colorful, comic book scientific looking diagrams.  Audio is available in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  There are some great extras like the `Hall of Armor' showing all four Iron Man designs, `The Invincible Iron man' and deleted scenes.  These deletions are great, including, 'I Am Iron Man', `Visuals Effects of Iron Man', a fantastic `Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test'. 'The Actors Process' (Downing and Bridges get down with some real improvisations), a semi-spoof trailer from `The Onion' on Iron man,' Theatrical Trailers, Galleries, Credits and Subtitles.  Not to leave anything out, more extras include six mini features such as `Friends and Foes' and ""Demon in a Bottle"".  If you're really into Blu-ray, try connecting to the Internet for BD-Live capability. This is one of the Blu-ray features that put it so far and above regular DVD.",Iron Man

They are probably committing illegal acts right now.....Just think about how Jeff Bridges betrayed Morton Junior.<br /><br />Also, this movie proves to me that the government(certain politicians and leaders) is good at only one thing.....covering up lies, cheating, killing, stealing, and manipulating.<br /><br />But if you have a closed mind and is naive, you will only see and hear what you want.",Iron Man

Jeff Bridges turned in an excellent performance also. I couldn't get over the unbelievable quality of the blu-ray.  Audio and video are the best I've seen.

I'm really huge on comic books turned movies as long as there done the right way, and so I'm glad to give this movie 5 stars & definitely glad to own it on Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray dvd came in a timely manner as stated so I appreciate that.",Iron Man
4028164,B001I1NGHY, AKNWEDEHX44G0,5.0, The Ultimate Superhero Movie,"Indeed, the title speaks for itself. The feature film is an outstanding example of a concise and focused plot, believable and impressive visual effects and masterful performance from the main lead.<br />In regard to the product itself, I thank Amazon for the prompt delivery before the predicted date. But still, 12 days is an agony for me here in Malaysia.<br />Nonetheless, the quality of this blu-ray release is well worth the wait. The video and audio is nothing short of mesmerizing. I'm watching it on my PS3 and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. But my only qualm is i've noticed that the video is a little grainy in parts. I wonder if this is common with every blu-ray.<br />On to the special features, i especially enjoyed the tie-in of the making-of documentary to its comic-book roots. Getting to know the origin and the artist and writers that have been involved with Iron Man is rather fulfilling. Also, the detailed approach in explaining the effects and such contributed much to my enjoyment. Robert Downey Jr's screen test, the theatrical trailers, hall of armors is a nice and welcomed edition. Not to mention, the BD-Live feature.<br />All in all, its a money well spent.

4028173,B001I1NGHY, A1WX42M589VAMQ,5.0," Downey is magnificent, the origin/epiphany tale is good, and the suit ROCKS!","This movie is the story of how a billionaire playboy becomes a superhero in a metal supersuit. It takes you through a man's epiphany of his role in a destructive system to his initiation of a system of protection and justice. Because...he's Iron Man. :)<br /><br />IRON MAN was not one of my fave comics growing up in...er...many years ago. I was more into the X-Men and Daredevil and The Flash and The Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange. When I heard they were making Iron Man as a film with Downey, my first thought was, ""Huh? Downey?""<br /><br />I should accept that when someone can act, they can ACT just about any role. Downey can act. (I always feel a little sad that so much time and energy was sapped by his substance abuse demons, when he could have been playing many more roles.) He proves it by being a believable playboy genius who grows up fast under some great pain and duress when, on a trip to Afghanistan, he becomes a prisoner. From there, the billionaire boink-fiend becomes a man with a...heart. In more ways than one.<br /><br />The second star of the movie is the special effects for the suit. OH MY GOSH! I want one. They managed to make the laughable bright suit I remember from my comics-riddled youth into something cool and effective and...sexy.<br /><br />The effect of his ""heart"" is also quite nifty, though less complex.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is somehow lacking her usual shine and spark here, but she isn't ineffective. I just know she can do better--and I like her a lot--and I was slightly disappointed that she was so, so...not up to Downey in this.<br /><br />POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS follow...you are warned:<br /><br />I didn't like Bridges as the corporate baddie. (Oh, come one. We all know he's the baddie from the first scene, right?) I find he's an actor who's either very on and works, or who's very off and sucks. I think he pretty much sucks here except for one scene. Ah, well.<br /><br />On the plus side, there is humor (Stark's quips and sarcasm and sass is irrepressible) to go with the dark stuff (ie, torture, violence, death, corruption, and so forth). The robot helper is a hoot.<br /><br />Another plus is Terence Howard as the military cutiepie friend of Tony Stark. He manages to be low-key, strong, and effective in his role with very few lines. He even manages to be funny. I like this actor very much.<br /><br />The sets work very well. You get the feeling that Stark really is not only a genius, but sui generis from the environment: His workroom, garage, home--all spectacular. And I do believe it's a Gehry structure in one scene (or a great facsimile of one.)  The reactor is displayed as a wonderful visual nod to the retro science fiction some of us still remember with great nostalgia.<br /><br />The direction is quite good: It has energy like mad when it needs it. It works with Downey's face and buffed-up bod in some highly potent close-ups and angles. But it's not something that is so feverish that you can't feel a decent change of pace. And it's not so showy that the camera becomes the star. At all times, Tony Stark/Downey is the star.<br /><br />When you buy/rent/watch this, make sure to either  sit through the credits (read a magazine, like I did while waiting to see if any goodie extras show up), or fast forward through them, because after the scrolling's done, you get a very brief scene in Stark's mansion where another superhero shows up...and it'll make fans of a particularly cool Hollywood actor holler. (I hollered.) Now I'll count the weeks until Iron Man II comes out.<br /><br />Oh, yeah.<br /><br />And for those who used to watch the Iron Man cartoon on TV aeons ago, you'll hear snatches of the theme song (the really dorky theme song, yes) that's sort of Sinatra-ed up here and altered for a phone ringtone there. Cute.<br /><br />Now, excuse me. I have the old Iron Man comic that tells the origin story, and I'm gonna go read it and see how it compares.<br /><br />Mir",Iron Man
4028174,B001I1NGHY, A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,5.0, Such A Cool Movie,"Looking at this year what will most people say was the best comic book movie of 08? Dark Knight, exactly but next in line is without a doubt Iron Man and that's for many different reasons. Out of the 4 comic book movies I can name off the top of my head that were released this year, Iron Man was definitely the coolest, with Dark Knight being the most authentic, Hellboy 2 being the biggest fantasy and Incredible Hulk just being the most insane. Robert Downey Jr. without a doubt made this film what it is, he delivers his very special brand of charisma and acting talent to a very cool and charismatic character. A lot of people have said that you couldn't have gotten a more perfect person to play Tony Stark and they weren't kidding.<br /><br />To those not familiar with the comic or have not yet seen the film, Tony Stark/Iron Man is the owner of the worlds premier weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. In the movie he is kidnapped by terrorists who hold him until he agrees to build them a specialist weapon, he agrees but instead builds an indestructible suit which he will use to break himself out of his prison. He manages to break out, but comes to realise what he's been doing has been the main force in a lot of innocent killings, so he designs a better version of the suit which he will use to help those in need.<br /><br />Downey Jr. has always been known as one of those special actors that will constantly put on amazing performances in little known movies, and very rarely gets a chance at a big time role. Iron Man is one of his biggest roles to date and he gets to star along such greats as Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard. Speaking of Paltrow, I don't think you could have gotten a more perfect role for Tony Starks P.A. Pepper Potts than the Oscar winner. The villain of the film is one hell of a scary guy, Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger is actually one of the more intimidating comic villains I've seen to date. Played by Jeff Bridges, I honestly think the guy deserves a round of applause for his role.<br /><br />All in all a great movie with some spectacular special effects, great action and actually a great message. Watch it, I promise you wont be disappointed.",Iron Man

4028178,B001I1NGHY, A24ZMNWTW8AQUR,5.0, High Praise for the Latest Marvel Movie,"Up there with Indy 4 and Prince Caspian, Iron Man was one of the top movies I was looking forward to this summer. And thankfully, I was not disappointed. In fact, just about every aspect of the movie impressed me.  As I expected, Robert Downey Jr. captured Tony Stark better than anyone else could have.  The wit, charm, and intensity he brought to the character incorporated everything essential about the billionaire industrialist. He's a playboy, eccentric genius, with a drinking problem. But when Stark discovers that his own company's weapons are being used by terrorists, he decides to live a life of purpose and make some big changes.<br /><br />Donning several versions of Iron Man suits, Tony Stark goes through as much transforming as his inventions. Iron Man is an origin story, but still allows for plenty of depth and character development without letting the story suffer. The supporting cast exceeded expectations: Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and even director Jon Favreau himself plays the small role of Harold Hogan.<br /><br />The special effects and technology also blew me away. From the testing of Stark's armor to the final showdown, viewers will be impressed at the amazing visual effects and plenty of big explosions.  With plenty of humor to lighten up the scenes of intense suspense and action; Iron Man is sure to be entertaining enough for the whole family. And after the credits roll, there's a fun little clip that fellow Marvel comic geeks will enjoy, hinting towards a sequel with some beloved characters.<br /><br />The summer blockbusters have certainly started out with a bang!",Iron Man
4028179,B001I1NGHY, A1RNMPOY4XIAA8,4.0, Summer gets an iron boost!,"The Summer season is here and this year it gets an iron boost from finally a new marvel comic franchise hopeful. Having no expectations for Iron Man I was more than surprised with how much I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This time the Iron Man-to-be, Tony Starks (Robert Downey Jr.), is a weapons manufacturing billionaire, not a nerdy college student. He doesn't need to buy a car to win over his childhood sweetheart, but instead has a super-sized garage with six cars and an assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow) who gets rid of his one night stands. In short, he lives it up in all the luxury one could dream of.<br /><br />While visiting a US base in Afghanistan to sell more of his weapons, the humvee he is riding is ambushed and he is taken captive by Afghani insurgents. They force him to build them one of his famous bombs, but instead he builds a great big metal suit! A suit which he uses to escape back to America successfully, and once home starts building a better one. Seeing the destruction of his weapons when they fall into the hands of insurgents he wants to shut down his weapons company. This does not go over well with a few people and brings us to a climatic fight between a villain (I will let you be surprised who it is) and Iron Man.<br /><br />The casting was perfect. Robert Downey Jr. plays his part as the fast-talking, careless billionaire who gets a reality check brilliantly, and Gwyneth Paltrow is immensely entertaining as Pepper Potts, his cool, calculated assistant. Together they have the perfect amount of chemistry that only increases your desire to see Iron Man II.<br /><br />Iron Man is a strong beginning to what will hopefully, yes I am actually hoping for more, be a successful franchise. Unfortunately with it being a good beginning, is where it faltered, only a little. First you could really tell it was setting up for more as there are actually very few scenes of Iron Man flying around (there are actually many more scenes of Tony building and testing his Iron Man suit) and secondly the end battle was not as spectacular or even intense as most superhero climaxes and ended rather quickly.<br /><br />Still Iron Man is a strong, very strong film to open the Summer Season, and does not disappoint. The mark of a good film is when, even with a running time of 126 minutes, it leaves you wanting more!",Iron Man
4028180,B001I1NGHY, A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,4.0, A Summer Movie That Doesn't Disapoint,"Iron Man is a Marvel Comic movie that doesn't disapoint. It's better than Spiderman 3 ""which even Fantastic Four 2 was even more fun than"" with more wit and a lot less whining, crying and.... disco dancing. Hell it's the best Marvel movie since Spiderman, Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2. It slowly picks up which is why it gets compared to the Hulk by some people. However it's always entertaining and more fun than the Hulk.<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr's Stark slowly becomes Iron Man but the movie is never boring since Downey carries the film well with his quick wit. It has pleanty of laughs while Downey himself is very funny while totally owning the character of Stark. He also has chemestry with Gwyneth Paltrow who has a quick wit of her own here as a trustworthy employee of his. Terrance Howard is in good form as well as Stark's military friend. I also liked a bald Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner. When there is action it's super cool and well done. But the movie wouldn't have been as good if Robert Downey Jr. wasn't casted. He's not just funny here but he shows that he can handle playing the heroic type and he does it well.",Iron Man
4028181,B001I1NGHY, AQZKKNNG6GWKV,5.0, Whoa!,"Let me say: A lot of times I go to a movie with high expectations and, though the movie may be good, come out disappointed. I entered Iron Man with HIGH expectations, and came out as satisfied and awe struck as is possible.<br /><br />First, Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man. He positively owns the part, stealing the show in pretty much every scene he is in. However, let us not take away from the good performances given by the supporting cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges. The acting is excellent, partly due to the screenplay, which is well paced and funny.<br /><br />With all the superhero movies coming out today, this one ran the risk of being too much like the others; not standing out enough. However, that risk was quickly abolished, in my mind, by a couple things:<br /><br />1. Robert Downey Jr. is so good as the title character...I just can't say it enough.<br /><br />2. The Iron Man armor is AWESOME!<br /><br />3. In my review for Batman Begins, I state the one of the reasons I like it was because the hero didn't actually posses super-human abilities. This one goes even farther in that way: This film is actually set in the real world. Instead of struggles in a city that doesn't exsist, Iron Man is set in the world we live, and therefore we can relate to the story more, as the enemies facing the hero are, more or less, the ones facing us today.<br /><br />Iron Man is my new favorite superhero, and he may very well become yours. Six stars.",Iron Man
4028182,B001I1NGHY, AIR1OLVTVMI3Y,5.0, Every bit of it is worth checking!!!,"Overall, Iron Man is the best two-disc package available on Blu-ray. The film is fun, the audio is mighty impressive and I can't in good conscience fault the video quality enough to deduct points. It may not be the most detailed picture I've ever seen, but I believe that could easily be accounted for by the camera work and CGI integration. Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job and the special effects give Iron Man a fresh, unique vibe that sets it apart from most action or superhero films. There are enough surprises and plot twists to keep any audience on their toes; enough humor to keep any audience laughing; enough character development to satisfy the critics and stark nerds; and enough effects and action to get the adrenalin rush thru our bodies. Iron Man gets my highest recommendation on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Now this is what you get for the BD version:<br /><br />Blu-ray Disc 1:<br /><br />Hall of Armor<br />The Invincible Iron Man Origins<br />Friends & Foes<br />The Definitive Iron Man<br />Demon in a Bottle<br />Extremis and Beyond<br />Ultimate Iron Man<br />Deleted/Extended Scenes<br />BD Live: Iron Man IQ<br /><br />Blu-ray Disc 2:<br /><br />I Am Iron Man The Journey Begins<br />The Suit that makes the Iron Man<br />The Walk of Destruction<br />Grounded In Reality<br />Beneath the Armor<br />It's All in the Details<br />A Good Story, Well Told<br />Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man<br />Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test<br />The Actor's Process (scene rehearsal with cast)<br />The Onion ""Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into Full Length Film""<br />Theatrical Trailers<br />Image Galleries<br /><br />Overall 10 out of 10, this is how a superhero movie gets done and how a BD is made.",Iron Man

It's one of those rare events where I felt as though someone had climbed into my head and figured out what I'd like. The special effects never get in the way. You kind of only know they are there because, well, we know we can't do some of that incredible stuff in real life today - not yet anyway.<br /><br />When I heard Robert Downey Jr. was playing the lead part, I had my doubts, but I now stand convinced he was/is the right guy for the role.<br /><br />I hope though that the criminals in the next installment have higher IQs than those in this one. At the beginning when Tony Stark was captured and locked in the cave, why would they place him in a room full of weapons to make weapons, not put men in the room to supervise him directly and not expect him to use all that technology to break out? After all, he is a well reknown genius.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this movie is definitely watchable and re-watchable. Jeff Bridges worked well in the movie too, though I couldn't help thinking he was playing Kris Kristofferson playing the role of Obadiah.<br /><br />All said, it is, in a word, fantastic.",Iron Man

I didn't go in to the theater with high expectations. But, after the movie was over I was speechless.  This movie has everything from comedy to action.  Iron Man opens with a breathtaking view of a desert.  Not bad.  Then you find out that it's in Afghanistan and the warm and fuzzy feeling fades away.  A military car comes into view fallowed by some rock music.  Still a bit confused.  That scene in the car with Dowry Jr. is probably one of the best scenes in the movie.  Not for class but for comedy.  And he doesn't miss a beat throughout the entire film.  The director does a good job of easing you into the movie and then he hits you with an explosion.  After that the movie cuts to a flash back of Tony Stark's life and what he is all about.  This movie can be a little confusing at first but its work the confusion.  Iron Man is warm, funny, action-packed and very visual.  Whoever came up with the costume design for the suit is a genius. If you have a chance I would definitely recommend this movie.

4028193,B001I1NGHY, AVOCNUFOXUCA6,5.0, Great movie!,"Given the spate of disappointing superhero movies over the years, I wasn't terribly excited about ""Iron Man.""  I probably would never have watched it if my wife hadn't wanted to rent it.  I'm glad she did, or else I would have missed a fun and entertaining movie.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. really made this movie shine.  It's a measure of the writing and direction that film could have succeeded with a different actor as Tony Stark.  But Downey really took the reins and put an indelible mark on the character all his own.  He completely owned every scene he was in.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" successfully walked the fine line of taking itself seriously enough that you actually care about what happens without becoming so serious that the whole movie collapses under its own weight.  Favreau and Downey deserve equal credit for that.  And Favreau does a great job of keeping ""Iron Man"" moving.  Who would have thought back in the day of ""Swingers"" that Favreau would become a big-time A-list director?  Hollywood often fails to notice talent, so it's great to see him succeed.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is excellent, and the special features are enjoyable.  Perhaps the most special feature is after the end credits, a la Ferris Bueller; be sure to watch until the very end!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to fans of action movies, superhero films, SF movies, or anyone who just plain enjoys a good movie.",Iron Man

Now I will admit that I am not an Iron-Man fan. In fact I knew almost nothing about him until I saw this movie but, after I left the movie theatre I wanted 2 know more about Iron-Man.<br />  The reason why I loved this movie was Bcause of the character of Tony Stark/Iron-Man(played by the incredible Robert Downey Jr.). He is in many ways similar 2 Bruce Wayne/Batman(he's rich, a genius, runs a huge corporation, and in his spare time fights the bad guys in a really sweet costume). Now I'm a HUGE Batman fan and I think Batman fans will love this movie & see the similarities & Differences Btween Bruce Wayne & Tony Stark.<br />  RDJr. really inhabited the role of Iron-Man mostly Bcause in many ways RDJr. is a lot like Tony Stark. My favorite scenes in the movie R when he is trying 2 test the parts 2 his suit. It showed RDJr.'s ability 2 be funny(even though he was getting tossed around the room a lot). Even though there's a lot of CGI in this movie and we really don't get 2 C Iron-Man punch a lot of people around I will agree that this movie was indeed one of the best summer movies I've ever scene.

4028211,B001I1NGHY, A96K1ZGW56S2I,4.0, The Age of Iron Begins,"Iron Man was a lesser-known hero in the Marvel universe.  He wasn't as well known as Spider-Man, the Hulk, Captain America, or the Fantastic Four.  Therefore, it was a bit surprising that in their freshman film as an independent film company that Marvel would choose Iron Man as the hero that their future would either be built or destroyed upon.  All doubts, however, have been put aside as 2008 has come to be the year that comic book movies became serious works of cinematic art, beginning with the release of IRON MAN.<br /><br />IRON MAN revolves around Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a billionaire whose fortune was built upon arms manufacturing to defend the free world from totalitarianism, tyranny, and terrorism.  Stark is also a brilliant scientist and engineer who designs many of his own weapons and devices.  While unveiling a new missile to American troops in Afghanistan, Stark is knocked unconscious, receives a heart injury, and is captured by terrorists.  The group calls themselves the Ten Rings.  They want Stark to build them a replica of the missile he just created for the U.S. Army.  Stark gets to work, but instead of building the weapon the terrorists requested, he builds a suit of power armor that he uses to escape from the terrorist camp.  After returning to the United States, Stark decides that his company, Stark Industries, is no longer going to be in the arms manufacturing business.  Seeing what his weapons can do when placed in the wrong hands is too much and he decides that the company will take a new direction.  He's convinced by his partner and good friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) to take some time off.  Stark uses that time to prefect the suit he created in the Middle East.  Meanwhile, Stane has plans of his own and the direction Tony wants to take the company in doesn't fit in Obadiah's plans.<br /><br />IRON MAN is an excellent comic book movie.  The acting is solid, the script well-written, and the direction superb.  The movie completely revived the career of Robert Downey, Jr. and turned Jon Favreau from being just a comic and family-film director into being a major directorial player.  Though hinting at a darker future (as well as plot developments for future sequels), the film is full of hope, optimism, and good old American patriotism.  When one thinks about it, IRON MAN is the type of movie that SUPERMAN RETURNS should have been a couple years ago.  I guess iron really is stronger than steel.",Iron Man

The movie is amazing, waited 2 weeks and a couple of days but was worth it. The picture in the front cover is great, the back of the case is not as cool the 2 disc edition but its ok. Now, there is a small portion of plastic removed from the side of the case( not the one where you open the case), it looked like someone bit that portion of plastic off. Im going to buy the new INCREDIBLE HULK dvd, so please AMAZON, be more careful with my next dvd. Anyway, trailers of the new Hulk, deleted scenes, NEW startrek trailer, so single disc is great if you dont want to spend more cash for the extra disc. I dont think anyone appreciates if their dvds came in damaged cases. The front and the back pictures are safe. Just that portion on the side. EXCELLENT MOVIE.",Iron Man

With the major advances in special effects and CGI it was time to finally bring the true comic book character off the page and to the big screen accuratly. Since then we have seen the amazing,(Spider-Man) the dreadful(Hulk), the Unknown (Sin City), and the renewed. (Batman Begins)<br /><br />Now a brand new experiment is about to take flight with a whole chain of movies linked together to culminate in what could be one of the highest grossing and most amazing films ever to hit the big screen. It all begins with the legendary Marvel character Iron Man. This is the story of rich and powerful Tony Stark suddenly finding out he is extremly vulnerable due to a complication with his heart. With this occurance Stark has an ephany and realizes there is more to life than power and he decides to use his power and inginuity to become a super hero. Now he has created a powerful exo-skeletal suit to keep him alive, but at the same time save the world and protect all that is good. All that with just a little time to show off is not too shabby.<br /><br />This movie is probably one of the best in the comic book film genre. It has all the elements that make a film enjoyable. An excellent origin story by director John Farravau. A steller performance from Robert Downey Jr. and his supporting cast. It's fast, dramatic, humerous and flat out fun. Still, this is only the begining of a much bigger picture in the Marvel film universe. But, you won't know that until the very end.",Iron Man

Downey is great as Stark, he's all charisma and steel will.  Downey has fantastic chemistry with Paltrow, frankly im not her biggest fan, but I really liked he in this, mainly because she perfectly played off of Downey.  Bridges is chilling as Starks nemisis, it's weird to see him bald, but it added to his chilling look.  The CGI Ironman is incredible and his battle with Bridges at the end was spectacular.  I appreciated how the screenwriter wove issues we have today into the formula of the movie, it made it resonate all the more.

It's light years ahead of any of the Superman movies, making them seem childish and almost corny.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie in the theatre, don't over-analyze or over-think the purchase of the DVD.

You could say it's the new ""Spider-Man"" and boy, does this trilogy look promising with its first chapter.<br /><br />How great is Iron Man? Well consider that I was still able to see it over one month since it's release date and it's still showing with multiple show times. Famed film critic Roger Ebert gave it a perfect four stars even. It could be this summer's top movie just as Transformers was 2007's.<br /><br />Iron Man reminds me a lot of the first Spider-Man film in how the story is not terribly complex but dynamic enough with everything else solid. Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Tony Stark, a intelligent, B.A. businessman & engineer. Gwyneth Paltrow who plays Pepper Potts, Stark's secretary and love interest, is able to successfully act with Downey Jr. so that their two characters show authentic chemistry. Every character was perfectly cast in my opinion.<br /><br />Industrial Light & Magic delivers again this summer with their work in Iron Man. Although it didn't blow me away like Transformers visuals did, the movie's effects were top notch quality and made the experience all the more enjoyable.<br />It seemed like an interesting, maybe even risky choice to have the musical score consist mainly of guitar-heavy, rock-like tracks but it turned out completely fitting with Tony Stark's personality and the mechanical brawn of Iron Man.<br /><br />All I can say to finish this review is to go see Iron Man if you haven't.

4028226,B001I1NGHY, AJ7SBFCIXPJM1,5.0, Iron Man--Works...And Then Some,"Many of the Marvel Films projects--outside of the Spider-Man (thus far) trilogy--have met with some very mixed results and reviews.  One is left wondering if Marvel has rushed their Universe out there too quickly.  Certainly, Iron Man--given to Jon Favreau to direct, and the controversial decision to go with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark--left many pondering if the right decisions were made in production and casting.<br />  Well...THAT WAS SETTLED.<br />  What we found out was that RDJ was not just a good pick, but a GREAT pick to play the hard-partying, hard-drinking weapons manufacturer who, when captured by terrorists who want him to make a weapon, comes up with a Ned Kelly-like suit of iron (The suit us fanboys recognize as the original Iron Man suit), and proceeds to get medieval on the terrorist encampment.  There were many who thought that Oded Fehr (Of ""The Mummy"" and ""Resident Evil"" movies) was the more likely choice to be Stark, but RDJ--and his own personal history with alcohol and drugs can't be dismissed in this casting--is nothing short of brilliant.  At points, RDJ does his usual fast-paced one liners and makes them part of Stark, but there are points that--with the epiphany his character has about 40 minutes in--that Downey becomes the performer we saw in ""Chaplin"".<br />  The casting is incredibly solid--Gwynneth Paltrow's return to work as Pepper Potts, Jeff Bridges' take on Obidiah Stane, and Terrence Howard's military liason to Stark, James Rhodes...plus, we can all see the sequel (or sequels) being set up through the movie--Howard's looking at the second suit and saying ""someday..."" prepares us for War Machine, and the terrorist organization that captures Stark--the Ten Rings--is an obvious reference to The Mandarin...<br />  But this movie ultimately is made...because Jon Favreau knew more than the bloggers when it came to casting Tony Stark.  He went with Robert Downey Jr, and because of that, ""Iron Man"" works...<br />AND THEN SOME.",Iron Man

Back home, he decides to stop his company from making military weapons, and focus on perfecting his metal suit.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is a great film, and as a superhero film it rates up there with ""Batman Begins"" and ""Spider-Man 2"".  It has action, drama, fumor, and great special effects.  The story of the self-made superhero is different and interesting.  Robert Downey, Jr. is inspired casting.  He IS Tony Stark, and he is at least as responsible for the greatness of this film as director Jon Favreau.

From the get-go Robert draws your attention to his millionair personality, and he gets away with it because he's a quirky kind of guy. I'm glad Roberts Bad days are behind him and that he has his Giant Success now. Best movie of the year, and I'm sure it's one of the best reviewed also. What could they be complaining about? It's a fantastic story, with rich characters and the best CGI this year. I look forward to the sequel slated to come out sometime in. Now that I think about it a little more, why can't we say that for now, this is an Oscar Worthy performance by big-time actor Robert Downey Jr.? I don't want to imagine this movie with anyone else. And STRONG performances by Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Jeff Bridges as the Iron Monger and the beautiful and flirty Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. The CGI was Fantastic!

Not all summer films achieve the goal of pleasing the masses but this new movie, based on the Marvel comic book hero, Iron Man, does just that!<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr., the talent and charismatic actor who received an Oscar nod for his turn in ""Chaplin"", takes on the role of Tony Stark, an extremely wealthy man whose fortune has been amassed by providing weapons to the world's warriors, good and bad.  After being abducted and held by terrorists in the Middle East, Stark realizes the damage his weapons are doing and decides to change the path of his business.  After escaping from his captors using an armor he creates during his abduction, Stark returns to the U. S. and begins working on an improved version that will allow him to fight the forces he has empowered with his own, technologically advanced weaponry.  Thus, the birth of Iron Man, a super hero with a flashy red and gold suit of armor that packs a treasure trove of crime fighting gadgets that would make even Batman jealous!<br /><br />  Aiding Stark is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his dedicated executive assistant and apparent future love interest and his best friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard).  Jeff Bridges plays Stark's mentor and father figure, Obadiah Stone, a man who took young Tony under his wing after the death of the elder Stark and groomed him to take over the Stark empire.  All three actors do a great job with their parts, especially Paltrow and Bridges.  Hopefully Howard's character will grow in the inevitable sequel.  And, of course, there is the usual Stan Lee cameo, which is quite funny in this film.<br /><br />  Jon Favereau did a great job with this movie and apparently pleased fans and non-fans alike, considering its impressive take thus far, both domestically and internationally.  Although I was a comic book kid growing up, I never read the Iron Man comic books but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I have to give kudos to Marvel for really making sure that their latest hero films are up to par---Spiderman (other than Spidey 3, which was a disaster), the X-Men films and now Iron Man have all been well made and appeal to everyone.<br /><br />  Grab a friend, buy some popcorn and sit back and relax with the first blockbuster of the summer!  Highly recommend!!",Iron Man
4028231,B001I1NGHY, A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,4.0, Iron Man lives again!,"After an eye-opening stint as a hostage in Afghanistan, multi-zillionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) gives up being a merchant of death to don a high-tech suit of his own invention and fight for justice and atonement as Iron Man.  This is a top-notch debut effort from Marvel Studios and hopefully portends more great movies to come.<br /><br />That said, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first two Spider-Man films.  A superhero really benefits from having a great villain to battle; Spider-Man has the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, Batman has the Joker, but Iron Man really never had such an arch-nemesis, even in the comics.  Maybe the Mandarin came closest (and there's a subtle nod to the character in the name of the terrorist organization The Ten Rings), but he's too mystical to be a good fit in a movie like this.  So for a finale we get Stark Industries CEO Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) in an even bigger suit.  By the end of this somewhat underwhelming climax, I was getting flashbacks to Robocop.  Nevertheless, the cast is great, the script is smart, and director Jon Favreau shows a sure hand with this material.  I'm looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />The final line of the film is perfect.",Iron Man
4028232,B001I1NGHY, A3FY3H6F4249E0,5.0, Great adventure flick!,"Saw it in the theater.  The movie begins in the mountains and deserts of Afghanistan, as a group of Army Hummers are transporting businessman Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) through the war zone. All of a sudden, explosions begin and shots are fired at the Hummers. US Soldiers are shot and killed.  Stark jumps out of the Hummer and starts running. As an idiot could guess, he doesn't get far before he gets shot and captured.<br /><br />Rewind 36 hours to an award ceremony at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, where Tony Stark is about to get an award for his achievements in the weapons' producing industry. His father began Stark Industries some time ago and Tony took over when Daddy died. Tony was a 6-year old product developer so, at probably 40-something, he is quite proficient now. He remains single and enjoys a romp with the ladies, now and then.  While the award is being handed out, Tony is gambling in Vegas and smoozing the women.  His military liaison (Terrence Howard) comes looking for him in the casino to remind him that he promised to be there for the award, so, you can see the carefree attitude of a stuck-on-himself, filty-rich genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow is his administrative assistant who takes care of everything for him. Stark has an awesome car, his own plane, and a computer system that would probably make Bill Gates drool, complete with holographic imaging. (You will likely recognize Terrance Howard when you see him.)<br /><br />Fast forward back to Afghanistan.  Stark was there to conduct a weapons missle presentation for the US army. Stark was seriously injured. He is hauled off to a terrorist camp.  As he looks around, he notices the camp is loaded with Stark weapons. He begins to realize that his lifetime labors of love have also been going to the ""bad"" guys to help them kill Americans.  The terrorists order Stark to build his new missile for them and they will set him free. He knows its a lie but it buys him time to appear to work on the missle. Instead he builds a very special iron man suit.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, with a shaved head, plays an interesting role. I believe he is chairman of the board at Stark Industries, or something similar.  This is a super good action film. Great job by all the actors. Good guys vs. bad guys theme. The computer graphic imaging was great, too. Approximately 2 hrs. Not for young children. (Some people get shot in Afghanistan, and although these scenes were not belabored, I doubt that you want your young impressionable children to carry these images around in their heads.)",Iron Man

So.......10 am on Friday morning, I was sitting in the theater with my wife hoping not to be disappointed.......we were not! The film's opening scene gets your attention and then back pedals a few hours to fill in the blanks. This works very well and makes you want to know the who, what and where!  Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man or ""ol' Shellhead""....if you will. I think his career is about to take a very big turn for the better after this film! I think he will forever be associated with this character like Toby McGuire is to Spider-Man. I can't see anyone else in either role now. Like the Spider-Man films, it's the characters who are the stars and that's what makes the FX and super hero stuff work so well. This is one of the best Superhero films since any of the Spider-Man films. I actually may go see this again, something I never do, well I did see the first Spider-Man movie twice. I don't know if anyone noticed this, but Tony Stark's cell phone ring was the theme song melody from the 1960's Iron Man cartoon,(totally cool)I love little things like this! 'Iron Man' takes the heart of the 'Spider-Man' films and the believable techincal aspects from 'Batman Begins' and comes up with one entertaining knock out of a movie!<br /><br />A compelling story, a great cast, superb special effects and most of all it's FUN!

4028234,B001I1NGHY, A1D4B0152IT2BP,3.0, Robocop was better...,"Judging by all the accolades given to this movie you'd think it was the greatest thing ever invented by Man.  Calm down, people!  It's just a movie!  Yet another in the long, too long, line of superhero franchises.  It has its moments and Downey can be funny.  But if you want the true Man-in-high-tech-armor-fights-bad guys film than you need to see Robocop.<br /><br />In truth, there are so many similarities, plot-wise, that you could easily argue it's a rehashing of the 80's classic: man is critically wounded, has a second life inside an impervious suit, finds out he was betrayed, has showdown with a similarly super-powered but much bigger foe, etc.  Sure, the special effects are kinda' cool, but Robocop's is even more impressive, especially when you consider they did it the old-fashioned way -- using real models, no CGI. And for true biting satire and gallows humor you can't beat it.  Ah, they don't make `em like they used to anymore.<br /><br />PS -- It feels like the movie has a pro-military stance in that Stark's weapons are never shown to kill civilians (""collateral damage"") when used by the US military, which is what I was expecting.  Instead you only see terrorists using his state-of-the-art weapons (which would be a lot less likely; terrorists tend to be pretty low-tech).  That kind of ""black and white"" portrayal was odd.",Iron Man
4028235,B001I1NGHY, A2X7NBUETXC19E,5.0, Let the Armor Wars begin!,"I had high expectations going into this movie. Iron Man is far and away my favorite comic book character. I've read nearly every Iron Man comic ever issued, and had some pretty unshakeable ideas of what an Iron Man movie should be. I expected a lot from Marvel on this one, though after seeing what a mess they made of Daredevil (my second favorite Marvel character); I was trying to maintain a cautious optimism.<br /><br />I needn't have worried. Iron Man was an absolutely incredible movie, and is an example of what a perfectly executed super-hero movie should be. I knew a good chunk of the movie would be focused on Iron Man's origin story, and I thought it was handled well. Setting it in Afghanistan instead of Vietnam was a smart move that kept things relevant. Everything that followed - Tony's return, the development of the real Iron Man suit, and the Stane confrontation - was handled just as well. The fact that Stane, an arguably obscure character in the Iron Man series, was used at all was a bold move, and one that I thought paid off.<br /><br />The movie's main asset was the strength of its cast. Robert Downey Jr. flat-out owns the Tony Stark role. I couldn't picture anyone playing Stark in the first place, but once he was announced I couldn't picture anyone else taking the role. His performance was brilliant, and his Stark was the perfect blend of the old school industrialist Stan Lee originally created and the boozing playboy Mark Millar depicted in the Ultimates. Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane was just as impressive. His physical presence was every bit as dominating as his business tactics, and while I knew from the start he was a bad guy, I couldn't help but like his character. The rest of the casting was less inspired, and more prone to lazy stereotyping. Damsel in distress? Check. Whiny sidekick? Check. Swarthy Arab terrorists? Check. That and the constant product placement are my only real gripes with the movie, and they're pretty minor, all things considered.<br /><br />As much as I hate CGI, I have to admit the Iron Man suit was a thing of beauty. I thought it looked sufficiently realistic throughout the movie, not to mention completely cool. Adi Granov (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785122583"">Iron Man Vol. 1: Extremis</a>) designed the definitive Iron Man suit of the past 20 years, and it was good to see it used in the movie. Iron Monger was a bit less impressive, but I can admit it was fanboy heaven watching the two armored titans slug it out. Speaking of fanboy heaven, the scene following the credits sent chills down my spine. Talk about taking a page from the Ultimates!<br /><br />Needless to say, I absolutely loved Iron Man. It did justice to the character, established another viable franchise for Marvel, and has to be ranked as one of the best super-hero movies ever.",Iron Man
4028236,B001I1NGHY, ASKHWF4LOF4KM,5.0, A bunch of fights and metal armor,"Based on Stan Lee's comic book, ""Ironman"" comes to the big screen. ""Ironman"" seems as an appealing superhero movie inasmuch as it has action sequences, a genuine script, and a pleasant acting.<br /> ""Ironman"" is the story of this inventor/armsdealer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) who is the inheriting owner of an arms company. He has a playboy personality, that's why he is always surrounded by women (most of them models). So, he was in Afghanistan testing his new weapon for selling to the U.S. Army, when suddenly there is an explosion and he is kidnapped by a terrorist group of this region. Then, while he is imprisoned; he creates a special metal suit, in order to get out of that place.<br /> On his way back to the United States, he calls for a press conference and informs them that his company is no longer going to manufacture weapons. After this swift decision, he gains some opponents. Another day, he was working in his lab when he saw on television how evil the Afghan terrorists were with innocent people; at this, he gets mad and decides to improve his suit, but now, he uses better materials and equipment, so he can fight against them.<br /> A positive element in this film, directed by Jon Favreau (Elf, 2003), is the special effects which we can notice in the engaging action scenes, also the locations where these fights are being held are fantastic, and the high technology used in the movie is amazing. The concise and accomplished script is funny and engaging, too, we can understand well the personality of each character, it has some funny lines (typical of Marvel's films) and there is a contrastive variety of scenes and situations that are going to keep you glued to your seat.<br /> The most remarkable point in this movie is the main characters' awesome acting. One of the best performances is Gwyneth Paltrow's, starring as Pepper Potts, Stark's lovable and reliable assistant who has a fresh look. She is always taking care and worrying about him. She also organizes his life; for example, she arranges his dates, his work, and his house. Pepper calls to mind Alfred, the majordomo on ""Batman"", because they both keep their friends' superhero identity in secret.<br />On the other hand, Robert Downey, Jr. can perform brilliant roles, such as: ""The Singing Detective"" (2003), as a superdetective, and ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), as an Australian who plays a black man; for this role, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. Now, he is a super hero and it is a role that matches for him as well. The supporting roles are also remarkable: we got Terrence Howard as Stark's military buddy Rhodey and Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane. Director Jon Favreau has also one scene minor role as Tony's driver and the comic writer Stan Lee has a brief part, too, as an old man in a party with some girls around him (Hugh Hefner type).<br /> ""Ironman"" (2008), a Paramount Pictures movie, is rated PG-13 for action sequences and violence.

The hero is somewhat less-than-virtuous particularly at the start, and has what appear to be almost crippling flaws.

He is a hero out to right a wrong that was done by that which he was responsable...weapons manufactured by his own company in the hands of violent, vicious people.  The change he goes through is entertaining and gradual...you don't really get any superheroics until about halfway through (unless you count his spectacular escape).

4028244,B001I1NGHY, A3V7YXOMKL0VSH,5.0, IRON MAN ROCKS!,"I can't imagine anybody else portraying Tony Stark better than Robert Downey Jr. I walked out of the theater at the end of the movie glad that the movie turned out so much better than expected...<br /><br />Full synopsis below:<br /><br />The movie begins with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) visiting soldiers on duty in the Middle East. He is joking with some members of a convoy who seem to be genuinely amused by his persona. Suddenly, the convoy is attacked. The soldiers fight to defend themselves but are quickly killed. Stark flees when a bomb (bearing the logo of his company, ""Stark Industries"") explodes, severely wounding Tony's chest. Tony is captured and recorded by a group of terrorists.<br /><br />A flashback sequence reveals Tony's history as a child prodigy before taking over his father's technology company at age 21. Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) attends a ceremony to present Tony Stark with an award for his work, but Stark is not in attendance. Tony's right-hand man (and his father's former partner) Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) accepts the award in Tony's honor. Rhody later finds Tony partying in a casino. On his way out, a reporter named Christine (Leslie Bibb) approaches Stark with some questions regarding the ethics of his weapons business. Stark deflects her questions with some swift quips and the two end up spending the night together.<br /><br />Next morning, Christine is awakened by a voice on a computer monitor. It's JARVIS, the artificial intelligence program responsible for running Tony's house. Christine is greeted by Tony's assistant, ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as she leaves the house. Pepper helps Tony catch up on some business before Tony heads out to the airport where his plane is kept.<br /><br />In flight, Tony talks with Rhody. Rhody is unhappy about Tony's lax attitude, and Tony tries to get his old friend to relax. Before long they are drunk and leering at the stewardesses.<br /><br />Tony arrives at a military outpost in the Middle East to demonstrate his company's latest project - the Jericho, a super-missile system. After the demonstration, Tony gets a phone call from Obadiah and they are both pleased that the demonstration went well. Tony goes off with the convoy that is soon attacked by terrorists.<br /><br />Much later, Tony regains consciousness in a cave. His chest is hooked up to a strange device. Another captive, named Yinsen (Shaun Tomb), explains that he operated on Stark but was unable to remove all the shrapnel fragments from the bomb blast. Yinsen created a device - essentially a battery-powered magnet - that will keep the remaining fragments out of Tony's heart.<br /><br />The terrorists who captured Tony & Yinsen enter the room. Yinsen translates; they want Tony to build them a Jericho missile. Tony refuses, so they begin to torture Stark.<br /><br />Hours later, the terrorists show off a huge stockpile of weapons-all made by Stark Industries. Tony appears to relent and start building the missile, but has other plans. With Yinsen's help, Tony constructs a tiny version of an arc reactor, streamlined from a much bigger design used at his company's headquarters. The power output is enough to run Stark's heart for fifty lifetimes... or something much bigger for about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Tony designs a way out for them - a powered weapon suit that he will wear and use to defeat the terrorists. Midway through construction, the head of the terrorist group (The Ten Rings), a man named Raza (Faran Tahir) arrives and attempts to torture Yinsen, angry because he thinks Stark is not working on the Jericho as they wanted. Raza gives them one more day to finish.<br /><br />Working overnight, Yinsen straps Tony into the completed armored suit, telling him the way out of the cave. They set off a bomb inside the cell as a distraction for the guards as Tony powers up his suit. Yinsen realizes that they will not have enough time. He grabs a gun and runs off to distract the surviving guards.<br /><br />Tony, fully powered, muscles his way through the cave. The guards try to stop but his suit easily deflects their weapon fire. Half-way out, Stark finds Yinsen, mortally wounded. Yinsen reveals that this was his plan, sacrificing himself so Tony could escape, as Yinsen's family is already dead and he will now see them again. Tony tearfully thanks Yinsen for saving him. Yinsen's last words to Stark are not to waste his second chance.<br /><br />Tony turns his suit on the terrorists, igniting flame-throwers. He destroys their stockpile of weapons and uses a rudimentary jet-pack to blast away from the captive zone. Not long after firing, his jet-pack explodes and he crashes in the desert, but survives.<br /><br />Stark hikes through the desert until a couple of US helicopters fly overhead. A group of soldiers, led by Rhody, come across Tony. Rhody is overjoyed to find that his friend is alive.<br /><br />Tony returns to the United States after three months in captivity. Pepper wants Tony to receive medical treatment, but Tony states that there are only two things he wants: an American cheeseburger and a company press conference. Shortly after, Tony appears before a group of reporters and announces that he intends to shut down Stark Industries' weapons manufacturing division immediately. At the same time, Pepper is approached by Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement & Logistic Division agency. They want to talk to Tony Stark about his capture. Pepper schedules an appointment for them.<br /><br />That evening, Obadiah confronts Tony about his actions, furious. Obadiah knows that the stock value for their company (and, by extension, their financial status) is going to take a serious drop because of this announcement. Tony wants Stark Industries to move forward with arc reactor technology, but Obadiah thinks that the arc reactor is nothing but a publicity stunt. Through the conversation, Tony ends up revealing his prosthetic power-heart to Obadiah. Stane convinces Tony to lay low for a while so the company can sort things out.<br /><br />Pepper watches a news report on the declining value of Stark Industries when Tony asks for her help. He's created an upgraded mini arc reactor, but can't install it into his chest without someone to help. Pepper accidentally yanks out the cords for the old reactor too soon, putting Tony on the verge of cardiac arrest. They manage to complete the process in time. Tony tells Pepper to get rid of the old model since he's not a sentimental person.<br /><br />Tony comes to visit Rhodes and asks for help with a new private project. Rhody does not agree with Tony's approach; he thinks Stark is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of his capture and needs time to recover.<br /><br />Tony turns to his other best friend - JARVIS, the A.I. program - for help. Tony's plan is revealed to be an upgrade to his armored suit (referred to as ""Mark 2,"" with the suit from the terrorist cave being Mark 1).<br /><br />Meanwhile, the terrorists who held Tony captive are searching the desert, gathering all fragments of the original armored suit.<br /><br />Tony decides that the first thing he has to do is to perfect the armor's flight system. Since the leg-mounted jets prove too unstable, he creates arm-mounted stabilizers to balance out the system. Pepper comes in when he is testing the stabilizers and they find that it also creates a powerful repulsion beam that could also be used as a weapon. Pepper leaves a box on Tony's desk.<br /><br />Obadiah visits Tony and reveals that the board of directors have filed an injunction to gain control of Stark Industries. Tony isn't worried; he still maintains controlling interest in Stark Industries.<br /><br />Tony finally manages to perfect his flight system, and is delighted at the prospect of flying.<br /><br />A new armored suit is soon finished, looking like a heavily-streamlined version of Tony's Mark 1 armor. Tony connects with Jarvis to monitor the progress in the suit. Tony decides to take it out for a test flight, and he is thrilled by everything the suit can do. Tony decides to push the limit for higher-atmosphere flying, but at such great heights the suit becomes coated with ice and his power supply shuts down. Tony is barely able to reactivate his thrusters in time to avoid crashing into the ground. Stark returns home, but the armor is so heavy that it crashes through three floors of the house.<br /><br />As Tony recovers from his crash landing, he opens the box that Pepper left behind earlier. It's his original mini arc reactor, encased as a trophy with the message, ""Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart.""<br /><br />Tony analyzes more data and decides to rebuild the suit using gold titanium from an old project to solve the icing problem. Tony also instructs Jarvis to add some ""hot-rod red"" paint to the next suit, codenamed Mark 3. Tony then leaves to attend his annual benefit dinner while the new suit is being assembled and painted.<br /><br />At the charity event, Tony meets with Agent Coulson, who still wants to learn about Tony's incident. Tony then leaves to dance with Pepper and they share a moment together in the moonlight.<br /><br />Tony is then confronted by Christine, the reporter from an earlier scene. She shows him photographs of his weapons being used by a terrorist group the previous day in the Middle East. Tony confronts Obadiah on the matter, and Obadiah reveals that he is the one who filed the injunction against Tony. Obadiah calls himself an ""Iron Monger,"" and has no qualms about selling Stark Industries weapons to both sides of the conflict. Tony returns home, furious.<br /><br />While he is at home, listening to news reports of the worsening situation in the Middle East, he tests modifications to his hand jets, turning them into a weapon. When the new suit is completed, Stark steps in and essentially transforms into Iron Man for the first time, determined to right his company's wrongs.<br /><br />In a Middle East village, terrorists are rounding up civilians for capture & execution when they are confronted by a mysterious figure in red and gold. Iron Man has arrived. Within seconds, he defeats the first group of terrorists, using his advanced weapons to take out several without any innocent casualties. He leaves the group's leader alive and defenseless for the villagers to take their revenge on.<br /><br />While flying to find his weapons, Iron Man is shot down by a tank shell. Getting up, a second shell barely misses him. He responds by shooting a mini-missile at the tank, destroying it. He succeeds in destroying his missiles and taking out most of the terrorists.<br /><br />During the fight, CENTCOM detects the unknown agent. Col. Rhodes is asked about the status of any new developments. He contacts Tony, who claims that he knows nothing about what is happening. In the meantime, Iron Man is confronted by two F-22's. He tries to outrun the jets but they are too much for him. Tony calls Rhodes and reveals that he is responsible for the ""unidentified craft."" Rhody is furious about Tony sending in unauthorized equipment, and horrified when Tony explains that the ""equipment"" is actually himself! Iron Man is hit by one fighter jet, sending him flying into the wing of the second jet. The pilot is forced to eject, but the parachute fails to open. Iron Man, still under fire, manages to fly in and successfully deploy the parachute in time to save the pilot's life. Tony convinces Rhody to pass off what happened with the jets as a ""training exercise.""<br /><br />As Tony arrives back at home, Pepper catches him removing the battle-damaged Iron Man armor.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Ten Rings terrorist group is visited by none other than Obadiah. It is revealed that Stane paid the Ten Rings members to kill Stark, but they realized who Stark was and demanded a much higher price. Obadiah takes the remnants of the Mark 1 armor they have gathered.<br /><br />Tony tries to talk Pepper into helping him, believing that nothing else matters but stopping the people who he put in harm's way. Pepper is moved by Tony's dedication, and agrees. She goes into Obadiah's office with a tiny piece of equipment designed to copy files from the computer. As Pepper sifts through stored files, she finds a video from the terrorists proving that Obadiah was responsible for Tony's capture.<br /><br />Obadiah comes into the office just as she is leaving, but Pepper manages to get away. However, as soon as he powers up the computer, Obadiah realizes what she was up to. On the way out, Pepper is joined by Agent Coulson and he agrees to help stop Obadiah with his fellow agents.<br /><br />Obadiah meets with his team of developers working on his own armored suit. They have rebuilt the components, but they cannot re-create Stark's arc reactor. Stane is furious; then realizes that he has one other option.<br /><br />Stane arrives at Tony's house and paralyzes him with a sonic weapon. Obadiah yanks out the power source from Tony's heart, taunting him all the while. After he leaves, Tony realizes that he has only one hope for survival - the preserved arc reactor that Pepper gave him in a display case. He gets the power source installed just as Rhody arrives.<br /><br />Pepper, Coulson and several other agents arrive at Obadiah's research facility. They spot the Mark 1 Armor and a storage location where something else was kept. Just then, a gigantic robotic suit comes to life and attacks them - it's Obadiah's counterpart suit, code-named the Iron Monger.<br /><br />Rhody watches Tony suit up, awestruck at the Iron Man costume. As Tony flies away, Rhody spots a new, silver-colored prototype suit... then shakes his head and mumbles ""Next time.""<br /><br />Iron Man arrives and begins to fight Iron Monger. Jarvis warns Tony that he has only about half power in the suit; the older power source wasn't designed to work alongside the newer suit. The two ironclad warriors have a huge battle. Tony grabs the Iron Monger and climbs higher. Iron Monger struggles but before long begins to freeze up - his suit still has the same icing problem that Tony's other suit had. Iron Monger manages to escape from this, and Iron Man is now almost completely powerless.<br /><br />Tony instructs Pepper to overload the building's arc reactor, which will generate a shockwave strong enough to knock out the Iron Monger's suit. Pepper is hesitant, believing that Tony could also be killed. Tony manages to keep fighting while she builds up power to the reactor. The reactor releases its shockwave, knocking out the Iron Monger, which falls into the reactor, killing Stane and destroying the reactor. Stark's original mini arc reactor sparks back to life, allowing Tony to survive.<br /><br />Days later, Rhody holds a press conference about the incident with the two robots. Tony is impressed with the newspapers coming up with the name ""Iron Man,"" and plans to adopt it. Agent Coulson has released cover stories about Obadiah and the ""truth"" about Iron Man (who will be referred to as Stark's bodyguard). Pepper thanks Coulson but cannot remember the full name of the group he belongs to. Coulson just tells them to call it S.H.I.E.L.D. and states that they will be in touch again.<br /><br />Tony goes before the reporters once more, and prepares to comply with the cover story. But, before he can even start, Tony Stark throws away his notes and declares ""I am Iron Man."" The press goes into a frenzy.<br /><br />Much later (after the credits), Tony returns home to find a mysterious man in black telling him that as Iron Man, Tony has become part of a larger universe. Tony asks who the man is. He turns around and introduces himself- Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson). He's come to talk with Tony Stark about an upcoming project- known only as ""The Avenger Initiative.""",Iron Man

The ending action sequence was disappointing. It was action for the sake of action and didn't quite work. My husband and I laughed, not in a good way, at the action scenes in the end and earlier when Pepper Potts helped Tony Stark change the device in his chest.

Jeff Bridges, until the end, which I already mentioned was very good too.<br /><br />Terrance Howard's and Gwyneth Paltrow's characters could have been played by just about anyone. They both have talent but were not used effectively. Gwyneth was treated more like a Bond girl but one with no charisma. Terrance's character was bland. Gwyneth's was too cold and unapproachable. All she seemed to do was to walk around in tight dresses with big high heels. Boring.

4028249,B001I1NGHY, AIC7J32QZY2KF,5.0, Iron Man is golden!,"Iron Man is one of those all too rare big budget movies that actually delivers. Downey was born to play Tony Stark but the real hero of this movie is the screenplay. A well written story, great charactors and terrific special effects.<br /><br />The film is about Tony Stark. The son of Howard Stark, also a genius. Tony inherits the company from his father when his father dies. He's basically partners with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges who also played the part brilliantly). Stark Industries is known for producing military weapons that, according to Tony, needs to be used only once to end a war. Tony soon finds himself captive of an Afghan rebel group that want his weapons made for them, because whoever owns his weapons, basically wins the war. Tony creates the classic Iron Man suit to get out of the captives hands and once he does, Tony decides he doesn't want to create weapons anymore. He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it. The rest of the owners of Stark Industries isn't to happy with this and they decide to, basically, just not listen to Tony anymore. While Tony's company is basically doing whatever they want, Tony is in his mansion revamping his original build of his suit. Not to ruin anything about the story, lets just say Tony is about to put his new suit into some good usage.<br /><br />Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation but it is darn close. It holds Downey's best performance in a long time. It is a fun, comic actioner that sure comes close to a ""perfect film"". I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years. Highly recommended.",Iron Man

Tony inherited the legacy of his father's company; a weapons manufacturer.  All the core elements of the comic are there. Jarvis is a computer in this one.  Happy Hogan, the chauffeur.  Gweneth Paltrow was extraordinary as Pepper Potts; IM's executive assistant.  Gweneth added dimension to what could have been a throwaway part.  Being his close confidant, she was privy to the issues that needed his attention.  The details of the original were all there.<br /><br />Over forty years of continuity of didn't bog down this story.  Unlike Hulk, Spidey and X-Men, Iron man wasn't one of the more popular characters.  Being true to form, following the comics ""Demon in a Bottle"" tale, Tony has a drinking problem.

It should be ""reins"".  I find it hard to believe Newsweek, even in a movie, would commit such misspelling.<br /><br />I do have a problem with the reactor on Tony Stark's chest, though.  This is the one that requires suspension of disbelief.  Since it is right in the middle of his chest, what happened to his breastbone/sternum?  what keeps his ribcage up?<br /><br />In his first test flight, he gets slammed into the wall, but shows no ill-effects. apparently, not even the reactor sitting between the upper and lower halves of his sternum gets rattled.<br /><br />For all his genius, he cannot hack into Obadiah's computer and needs to send Pepper on a spying job.<br /><br />For all their leading edge technology, Stark have no technology for removing shrapnel from a man's chest?<br /><br />He gets shot down by a tank! If all tanks are that good at shooting flying objects, we'd have no need for separate anti-aircraft guns and missiles.  Ironically, in the next shot, the tank misses when Iron Man sidesteps the shot.

4028279,B001I1NGHY, A3IKBHODOTYYHM,4.0, Great comic book movie!,"What was enjoyable about Iron Man was that it was a smart addition to the Marvel Comics film adaptations. There are some action scenes, but they don't attempt to mask or steal the show or moral of the movie (that weapons in the wrong hands can have devastating results). After realizing that his father's company was inadvertently leading to the destruction of lives, and after having a terrifying experience being held hostage in the Middle East, multimillionaire Tony Stark (Downey) changes his tune of his invention-making ways, saying that he will not create anything aimed at destruction again. However, some information of making the perfect destructive machine has leaked, and now it is in the wrong hands. Sometimes the ones closest to you are the ones who turn against you, and now Tony battles both sides of evil.<br /><br />Although the film was two hours, it was a quick two hours because of the pacing of the film. There aren't crash scenes that drag on for long periods of time, and the plot and script were well-written enough to keep all main characters involved in the climactic and critical scenes. The major characters all did great jobs in their roles: Gweneth Paltrow does a commendable job as Stark's assistant, and Jeff Bridges does an excellent job Stark's company business partner.<br /><br />I would rank this film just a shade lower than Spiderman 2, but I think they are two of the best comic book movies out there in recent years.",Iron Man

4028281,B001I1NGHY, A2RIE6JUUANXBV,5.0, A Gem for both Comic Fans as well as the uninitiated!,"One of the Best Comic genre movies to date, coming close to the caliber of the Dark Knight (which hails as the best comic book movie of all time).  I'm not a big Robert Downy, Jr. fan but he nails it in this movie.  His interpretation of Tony Stark is the nearly the best coupling of actor to a comic book character yet; certainly better than Eric Bano's Bruce Banner. He even gets closer to his character than Christian Bale (which I have to say is the best Bruce Wayne to date)--and almost as accurate as Ledger's Joker (who could get that close?).  Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect Pepper Potts, which, as this is a supporting role for her, points to her professionalism as one of the upper echelon of actors.  Of course, Jeff Bridges' performance is equally impressive.  The CG is impressive and not overdone.  The story is very well written staying true to the Iron Man mythos.  This is well worth your time and money.",Iron Man
4028282,B001I1NGHY, A2R3VMCQFAYRCW,4.0, Thanks for not being Batman,"Robert Downey, Jr. stars in the blockbuster movie Iron Man as Iron Man. His character is Anthony Edward ""Tony"" Stark, inventor, playboy, and self-proclaimed Iron Man.<br /><br />Iron Man is the perfect marriage of man, machine, and product placement. Despite all of the products placed in this movie, Iron Man is actually really good. The technology is crazy cool, action is on the money, and the story is tight. Verizon Wireless has the best deals on monthly plans.<br /><br />I am happy that Iron Man did not go the Batman route. Every superhero movie since Batman Begins and The Dark Knight has to have a depressed and dark hero. Iron Man was funny and serious and action-packed all at the right times. Maybe Iron Man II: Cold Steel will have a much darker twist, like Tony discovers that he has agoraphobia and has to stay in his suit in all social situations.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are worth picking up the second disk DVD set. Actors, writers, and filmmakers alike can learn a lot of from Iron Man. You don't have to have huge explosions to get a point across. There was just as much action going on internally with Downey's character as there was action on the screen. The extras on the DVD highlight some of these points and can be used to learn something about great filmmaking and movie acting from Robert Downey, Jr., whose father is Robert Downey, Sr.<br /><br />Published at www.NotHans.com/podcast",Iron Man
4028283,B001I1NGHY, A2NZAGMAS7N5ZP,4.0," Iron Man, Does Whatever An Iron Can","So first we had X-men, then Spiderman and afterwards other countless Marvel Comic adaptations that were either majorly or moderately successful. But what do we have to expect for Iron Man, does it live up to the expectations of the fans, does it match up Spidey or X-men? Honestly it does; this adaptation proves that the comic book genre can still bring a character from the pages of a comic and yet maintain it fresh and new to a vast broad audience.<br /><br />In this first and clever adaptation of ""Iron Man"" we have Tony Stark, A genius and ambitious weapons business man who finds himself after being captured by Terrorist. These terrorist have weapons built and designed by Stark; they need Stark's help to build a super intelligent missile known as ""the Jericho"". In his attempt to create this weapon Stark creates a better and more efficient weapon...obviously Iron Man.<br /><br />The movie is a popcorn flick above all, it does however mange to create a very well crafted origin storyline; maybe not on the level of Batman Begins or Superman: The Movie, but it still brings in a good transition of how Stark finds his true destiny and purpose. The effects for the film are stupendous all the way. The only problem I found with the movie was 2 things. One the later half of the movie changed from what seemed to be a serious comic book movie, into an adrenaline fueled action extravaganza. Sure action is cool, but the way the ending was placed with him fighting the other Iron Man...it felt sort of silly; As if the ending was just a filler to have Iron Man facing someone for the hell of using more effects and having the audience feel the use of the 135 million dollar budget for the film. Above all this the movie is still a triumphant adaptation; the majority of the characters are superb in their acting. Downey Jr excels marvously as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and it's a great movie to watch with the family...I think. Anyways a must own by fans of the genre or new comers.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5",Iron Man
4028284,B001I1NGHY, A10ZBR6O8S8OCY,5.0, Stunning in Blu Ray,"This is one of the best movies to showcase HD capabilities.  I popped this in the Playstation 3, on a 61 inch Samsung DLP with a Denon soundbar and it was amazing.  The Iron Man suit looks like it is standing right in front of you.  I didn't know the suit had so much detail and movement until I watched it at home.  It looks better at home than it did in the theater.  The sound is superb.  You must watch this with the audio turned way up.  You can hear every blast and jet propulsion sound coming from the suit when Iron Man is flying.  My favorite visual and audio part is when Iron Man is flying in the sky and the 2 jets are chasing him.  Turn the volume way up and hear the surround sound go from one side of the room to the other as Iron Man and the jets fly by.  I love it.  Simply amazing.

Billionaire inventor and weapons producer Tony Stark is captured by renegade forces who want him to create a super-weapon for them. After requesting the supplies he'll need, Stark instead creates a metal suit for himself, using it to bust out of captivity. Now fully realizing the great havoc his weapons inflict, Stark vows to act as a protector of the human race and undo some of the damage his creations have caused.<br /><br />I thought that this movie was good, but I was actually expecting it be a tad more spectacular. Maybe because I'd heard it being discussed in glowing terms for the better part of a year. It's hard to live up to such hype.<br /><br />I thought Robert Downey Jr. did a fabulous job. Gwyneth Paltrow did a fair job for the role she had, but Pepper Potts didn't seem to be a very pivotal character in this film. I loved Terence Howard, and I'm disappointed about the rumors that he may be replaced in the next film in the series. Jeff Bridges chewed the scenery gloriously. (He looks very ominous without his hair!)<br /><br />The effects were great, and I'm glad to see how the SpiderMan series and King Kong have cemented a new rule of thumb in hero/effects films (one started by Titanic, I think): even if the movie is all about effects, it will be better if you cast people who can actually ACT in the lead roles. (Not just models. Not just bodybuilders. ACTORS.)

Based on the Marvel comic book and created by the brilliant Stan Lee, IRON MAN is a super-hero, a science fiction, an action-action adventure, and a heartwarming, feel-good movie, all rolled into one.<br /><br />In IRON MAN, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a playboy genius, a cross between DaVinci, Tesla, and Don Juan.  As the CEO of Stark Industries, he has single handedly revolutionized the defense industry in his attempt to bring security and peace to the world.  When he is kidnapped by terrorists, Tony Stark realizes that the technology he has been steadily inventing since he was a child is falling into the wrong hands, bringing devastation and death to those he is trying to protect.  In captivity, Stark builds the prototype IRON MAN suit, and escapes.  Back at home, Stark has a crisis of conscience and decides to stand down Stark Industries weapons divisions.  Building the ultimate mech suit, Stark becomes IRON MAN, and single handedly sets out to end terrorism and save the world.  Of course, nothing is ever easy...<br /><br />All of the performances in IRON MAN are excellent and very enjoyable.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s transition from philandering whiz kid to caring, sincere patriot who wants to do the right thing is outstanding and real.  The rest of this fantastic cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub) are equally good, creating believable, genuine characters, both good and evil.  The special effects rock, and are seamless and very fun.  The computer that runs Stark's home and inhabits the IRON MAN suit is very funny, exhibiting an acerbic wit that must have been very fun to write.<br /><br />There are some pretty big clues that are more IRON MAN movies to come.  I sure hope so.  I can't wait to see IRON MAN continue his fight for ""truth, justice, and the American way.""",Iron Man

Of course there were tremendous action scenes, and very evil villains, but the hero was different. The hero was intelligent. It was so refreshing to watch someone with great intelligence problem solve during ""impossible situations"". Also, although he starts out as a rebel with a bad streak, he experiences a major transformation and the audience gets to watch his character develop in a way that I found to be meaningful.<br /><br />Although the movie dragged a bit at some points, it became so interesting that I wanted it to keep going. In fact, I'm really looking forward to the next Iron Man movie (the plot totally calls for it so I'd guess it will happen).<br /><br />I would also mention that Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding. I've always considered him to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and he did not disappoint.

His ability to make the one liners snap really works, and I was laughing at plenty of them. He was also really convincing as a genuis billionare weapons manufacturer. He almost made it look like a really cool and fun job.<br /><br />But of course it's not. He's kidnapped and forced to build, and use, his own weapon against himself and his country. But instead of doing that he invents a suit that turns out to be an awesome piece of technology.<br /><br />The special effects are really cool in this movie. They don't really look CGI or anything at all. They feel pretty real even though you know none of it is likely to be possible in say next year.<br /><br />The movie flows along at a pretty good pace. It's rather short, but you don't notice it until the movie is done. I really like that it seems longer, but isn't.<br /><br />The entire cast I felt was really good in this.

He makes the hero a very human character.<br /><br />Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.<br /><br />The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly.

My husband is a comic book geek, and we have all learned about the DC and Marvel universes via osmosis. In other words, we know our comic book heroes.<br /><br />Ironman far outshines all other comic-based movies to date. This movie has the rare mixture of a comic book feel, great story, characters you care about, AND...NO Cheese. I was hesitant when they cast Downey for the part- I am a huge fan, but felt he would not make a good Tony Stark. I was completely wrong- Downey IS Tony Stark. Flawless. The Director was wise enough to let Downey do what he does best- ad lib. He is a natural comedian, and added just enough humor to turn an ok role into a work of art. This movie would have been average without his comedic presence.<br /><br />Paltrow ended up being a good choice as well. She is like wallpaper most of the movie, present, but not overwhelming. This allows Downey to stay in the spotlight where he belongs.<br /><br />I have seen ALL of the comic based movies, as well as many of the animated straight to DVD as well. Mind you, there are many other good movies. Heath Ledger was INCREDIBLE as the Joker in the latest Batman movie. However, as an overall great comic-based movie, Ironman is going to be really hard to beat as my all-time favorite.<br /><br />I hope there is an Ironman sequel in the planning, and hoping they do as good a job with the Avengers as they did with this one. MArvel has stepped it up a notch. Maybe this will push DC into giving us the Justice League movie we all know they're capable of????",Iron Man

4028294,B001I1NGHY, A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,5.0, Simply Awesome!,"We have seen this movie three times already. First, we enjoyed it by ourselves; then, with friends and finally with the family.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays the lead role of this superhero story. Tony Stark is a brilliant individual who graduates from MIT at an early age and goes on to design many of the weapons sold by the company his father founded.<br /><br />The movie immediately hooked us for we see Stark visiting the Middle East, delivering weapons and demonstrating the power behind his designs. The pace is amazing as we confront terrorists who to Stark's horror and dismay; use the very weapons he designed for our protection as the tools of mass destruction. How is this possible if he only sells to friends?<br /><br />Stark is captured and transforms into Iron Man by a suit he designs that makes him indestructible, with weapons to fight innumerable enemies and able to fly to safety.<br /><br />He escapes and comes back home where his assistant, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is waiting for him at the airport. It is fun to watch Stark tell her ""the vacation is over"" and that the first thing he MUST do is eat a cheeseburger. Burger King must have paid a fortune for this ad.<br /><br />The technology used in this movie is razor edge, his ability to design in a three dimensional environment is simply awesome. As usual, the bad guys interfere at every turn and he discovers that the force behind his many encounters with challenges is in the identity of which he thought was a close ""friend.""<br /><br />This movie provided adventure, romance, intrigue and comedy.

You can really witness how much love Jon Favreau has for the source material. Robert Downey Jr. was an inspired choice to play Tony Stark, the billionaire superhero jerk with no superpowers, just a super brain that he uses to escape from terrorists. His company, Stark Industries, is a weapons manufacturer which he inherited from his father. After his escape, he changes his outlook on life and (much to the disappointment of some) the company. The film is well made, brilliantly paced, and has terrific performances throughout. The deleted scenes (from the DVD) were good choices to nix, because you can tell how they would have totally screwed up the flow of the film.<br /><br />The two-disc collectors' edition does not disappoint.

I would still reccommend this even with my tiny slowing down problem.",Iron Man
4028297,B001I1NGHY, A1W0PUJUZ9IMZU,3.0," Solid, but could use a stronger heart","Iron Man is solid super-hero fare which employs the traditional themes, tropes and symbols.  It should prove satisfactory to a broad audience, but could have been so much more satisfying, probing, or insightful if it used more clever storytelling.  Other than the themes it introduces about the military-industrial complex and US foreign policy, it is the same superhero origin story you have seen many times.<br /><br /> Robert Downey Jr. and Jeff Bridges offer excellent performances.  Downey Jr. mixes cocky arrogance, critical humor, and a compelling transformation of a character who represents the worst aspects of the military-industry complex experiencing an inner conflict over the destruction that his inventions have caused.  Jeff Bridges was terrific, but the film used him to less effect than it could have.  At the onset, I thought Bridges only touched on his potential usefulness, which is when he plays someone who is operating at many levels, particularly as ""the Dude"" in The Big Lebowski, where he is always up to something, and nothing, all at once.  So at the beginning, I thought he might be up to more than just helping out Tony Stark; but, his character shifted from a helper to a plain-old greedy bad guy without the transformation that I think Jeff Bridges could have pulled off if the film gave him the time and context to do that.  Gwyneth Paltrow offers a convincing performance of a woman who sees beneath Stark's stark exterior and sees the man behind the jerk, and the suit.<br /><br />The visuals, including Iron Man's heads-up displays and Tony Stark's computers and droids were fantastic.  The portrayal of the software underlying the hardware suit seemed to explain how this suit could actually work, and perhaps explains why this film could be made now instead of years ago - not only can digital rendering make a believable-looking suit for a movie, but the possibility of such a suit in today's world is itself more believable.  It's not a man in an iron suit, but a man with a multi-layered shell that is mediated through a software interface.  The film is aware of this, as Stark even comments on the newspaper's characterization of him as an iron man.  Nice touch.  Stark even suits up in a neoprene layer that would help to explain the buffer between him and the metal, as well as possible housings for the software - how the filmmakers missed the opportunity for an Under Armour product placement is beyond me!<br /><br /> The themes about US policy, weapons and industry lent an air of integrity to the film, but it seems those issues rapidly disappeared.  The irony, that Tony Stark becomes injured by the very weapons he manufactures, provides a great means to propel Stark toward his transformation.  The updating of the specific context from Vietnam (in the early comic books) to Afghanistan works very well, and shows that comic and superhero characters often reflect issues of their time and should be considered valuable forums for cultural dialogue.  However, the film seems less interested in those issues, and more interested in Stark's new suit.  It's unclear just what Stark's peace plan was, which means that although the film raises questions about responsibility and power (in both a personal, superhero sense and a national policy sense), it just leaves them behind to tackle the more personal issues and get the superhero flying around.  It could have also explored the theme of technological and human development, the boundary between machine and man, the exteriors we present to others compared with our inner needs and drives, etc.  Doing so would have made the film truly invincible, but unfortunately it just flies right on by those issues.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with the film, was that it was basically a two-hour origin story that followed, in the abstract, the same formula that every other superhero origin story follows.  Couldn't the writers have told us the origin story mixed in with a story progressing in the present?  I felt like I sat for two hours watching could have been a five or ten minute origin story.  Now that the film is over, I am ready to go see an Iron Man adventure!  In some ways, this is the problem with almost every super-hero movie - each new movie is just the same story with a new character, and then when it makes some money, the studio approves a sequel.  Two models that Iron Man could learn from are Star Wars and Speed Racer.  Part of why Star Wars (Episode IV) was so engaging is that Lucas explicitly left out the explanations - we were already caught up in an unfolding plot (he explains this in the audio commentary to the DVD releases that include the original film formats).  The opening sequence of Speed Racer manages to introduce the necessary origins at the same time it moves the current story forward.  Iron Man, however, is a movie about how another movie might yet come to be.  The filmmakers know this, and if you wait until after the credits, which for some reason I let the film run and caught this, you will see that they have one eye looking toward this future film.<br /><br />Although Iron Man is a fun film that has some great visuals, conceptualizations, acting and political relevancy, I wondered why I had to sit through yet another origin story.  It is solid, though, and should please comic fans and general audiences.  Now that I've gotten the origin story out of the way, I look forward to the first of the Iron Man Adventures!<br /><br />Format review:  The Blu-Ray disc that I watched has a nice special feature on the history of Iron Man, including interviews with Stan Lee and various other artists and writers who have worked on his stories.",Iron Man

But it's still not too dull at all.<br />*Some violence may be too much for young children (rated PG-13).<br /><br />Once you get into it, this is quite an exciting and slick superhero movie. Much of the action and effects are quite memorable. The characters are not too shabby. The story has enough of everything to keep it engaging, even when there's nothing happening. Moreover, it has some subtle elements reflecting modern-day issues (with terrorism and arms dealing). It is quite enjoyable, and would rank it as being better than ""The Fantastic Four.""",Iron Man

When I was a kid Iron Man was my favorite comic book so I was happy about this transition to the screen. The story, acting, directing, effects, and music were excellent. Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges give stand out performances. I can't wait for the sequels. The DVD quality is excellent and the single disc played fine on DVD player and PC. The only extras are the deleted scenes on the single disc but then it was only $14.99 if you pre-ordered. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy action movies. Great quality DVD with exceptional replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Batman Begins"" and ""Hellboy"". Some super heroe sequels aren't as good on many of the super hero original movies and a couple were less than stellar on the first release, let's hope Iron Man sequels will be the exception.<br /><br />CA Luster",Iron Man
4028302,B001I1NGHY, A2RN9145GJWDGU,5.0, Can't Wait for Iron Man 2 & 3!,First off. Everyone should know that the director wants to make this a trilogy. I LOVED THIS MOVIE. It is so fun! I personally liked this better than Spider Man & every other superhero movie. It is fun for adults and kids. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome! Thank you for bringing this movie into the world. This definitely goes in my top 10 movies of the year already. The acting and quality of the film is very good too.,Iron Man
4028303,B001I1NGHY, A3SR4YYPA7DOV4,5.0, Downey is legendary in this role,"I'm biased. I loved the film, and saw it twice at the theatre. Downey was a surprise casting decision for me, but it works perfectly. He brings an attitude and maturity that a younger man would not have had.<br /><br />The film succeeds better than most comic book adaptations by not trying too hard to be cool. There is a realism in the narrative that is subtle, but effective. Luckily, even though it's an FX driven film, it's not edited in a way that draws your attention to them. That being said, the FX are INCREDIBLE.<br /><br />The final fight is fairly anti-climactic. BUT it's AWESOME from start to finish. Great funny gratuitous action.",Iron Man

4028307,B001I1NGHY, A2ICYTQK3ZCX0Z,5.0, A Celluloid Heroic Fantasy That Excites And Makes A Statement To Hollywood And The World,"I saw it yesterday afternoon.<br /><br />I did something very bad. I should have known better being a comics head.<br /><br />Ya never walk out before the credits are done.<br /><br />Let's dispense with the minor caveats first. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was a little foppish. He did a great job otherwise, and I wasn't one of those whining about him being chosen for the role. Although if this were twenty years ago, you would have had to give the role to Tim Dalton or I would have called for a boycott. Despite the slight lack of seriousness in Downey's portrayal, I really can't imagine anyone else doing the role justice. He got to the heart of Tony Stark, the conflicted billionaire industrialist with an armored alter ego, even if I would have preferred Downey's Stark to be a little darker. Perhaps we'll get that in the sequel.<br /><br />And the Iron Monger? I think I would have rather seen the Titanium Man or the Crimson Dynamo. Iron Monger didn't appear until way later in the comics and did himself in not long afterwards. However, Jeff Bridges was a fine choice, and held up his end well. If you weren't into the comics, you didn't see his double-cross coming. But when I heard the name ""Obadiah Stane"" (now I know how to pronounce it after 20 years), I thought ""Uh-oh."" Which brings me to what really got me into this movie. The foreshadowing...<br /><br />There's a terrorist group called The Ten Rings. Hmmm...The Mandarin wears ten rings, one on each finger. James Rhodes eyes up a spare suit of armor. SHIELD is mentioned. Then there was that little cameo I missed...<br /><br />The creative balance that was achieved also struck me. It's as if the makers were very mindful in creating a film with comics fans, casual moviegoers, and thinking viewers in mind. The changes made from the comics to the screen were necessary, otherwise it would have had to be a period piece and wouldn't have been nearly as relevant. In fact, my distaste for what has been done with Iron Man as of late in the comics, has been neutralized at least somewhat due to this movie. Redemption, in my mind, was one of this film's messages. The idea of war profiteering is addressed. Tony Stark, after surviving capture and seeing what his killing technology (apologies to Voivod), has wrought, decides he will not longer profit from manufacturing weapons. That plot point alone makes Iron Man a more timely superhero movie than any other I can think of.<br /><br />Downey's protagonist and Bridge's antagonist aren't the only stars who shine. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts really captures the Girl Friday aspect of Potts' character as well as that of someone who's ""just a friend"" to a superstar guy. Terrence Howard's James Rhodes also impressed me as he came off as more than just a mere sidekick and straight man. Howard and Downey really had the ""buddy mojo"" working. You really believed that these two men from two totally different worlds and lifestyles could be the best of friends just as they are in the comics.<br /><br />And of course the special effects were godly. The armor looked so real you felt as if you could touch it. Iron Man flew and ducked and dove like a half-man/half experimental aircraft. Yet, it didn't seem totally robotic either. The armor had an organic sense to it also, looking as human as a living weapon could without sacrificing the tech.<br /><br />To tell the truth though, I could have done without the missles. Iron Man is not a tank. Repulsor rays are just more elegant, and they weren't neglected. But again, minor caveat. The fights were spectacular. When Iron Man and Iron Monger clashed, it was a cross between two knights battling for virtue and vice and two machines making war for the common good or ill of humankind.<br /><br />So what we have here is an excellent heroic fantasy tale with a touch of James Bond, a swig of Golden Age cinematic romance, and a pro-peace message that takes more than a jab at the military/industrial complex. It's a film that I can effortlessly refer to anyone, lovers of comics and cinema alike. Although it may not have the emotion and drama that the Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men, and Superman outings have had, I believe that Iron Man will go down over time as the most properly executed work in a genre that most filmmakers still have yet to grasp.<br /><br />Respect the source material and the field in which the tales are originally told, and you will reap dividends, creatively and commercially. Let Iron Man be yet another lesson to Hollywood.",Iron Man
4028308,B001I1NGHY, A3TZLMZVP5H5J4,3.0, Crappy ending ruins what otherwise was a pretty decent movie,"So you have a superhero who tells everyone who he is. Why not paint a bullseye on his back. Its one thing if your powers are obvious such as the F4 but to tell the world you developed this amazing combat suit is plain dumb. What kind of sequel can they make out of this.? Beats me.<br /><br />The Suit though was cool and sleek. A very good interpetation of the Iron Man Comic Uniform. Overall a decent plot, been done before though with the trusted manager turning out to be a crumb and turncoat. An Ok film with a defeatist ending imho.",Iron Man
4028309,B001I1NGHY, A1R754POQNJO51,5.0, Flawless,"Absolutely flawless until the final 8 minutes where the CGI action was a tad too rushed, over-the-top, and phony-looking. But given it WAS the final 8 minutes and given the genius of the rest of the movie (look quickly and you'll see Captain America's shield in Stark's workshop about 2/3rds through the movie! What a little surprise among many!), the final 8 minutes are fully forgivable and can be considered just enough to allow a sequel (and/or The Avengers movie) to be even better.<br /><br />For those who salivate over The Dark Knight, it was a great crime movie, but a mediocre superhero movie. Iron Man was a GREAT superhero movie. #1 on many people's all-time lists.<br /><br />I, as many other reviewers I've read, despise Robert Downey, Jr., and Gwenyth anti-USA Paltrow in real life but they nailed the parts well, and like most of Angelina Jolie movies, they're better people in their movies than in real life. (Although Downey is far better in real life than he used to be, gotta give him a lot of credit.)<br /><br />Just flawless really and we don't hesitate to forgive the final 8 mins of stilted CGI action!!!",Iron Man

He is a natural and really embodies the character just right. There is wit and charm and appeal. However, I found the movie a tad on the slow side and fairly predictable. There was no doubt in my mind who the 'bad guy' was, and I know nothing about this comic book.<br /><br />This film, though fun at times did not spark my interest like The Dark Knight or even Transformers did. There were boring lulls and nothing particularly interesting to fill the action-less void. Iron Man is certainly a very good comic book movie, far better than many I've seen, but certainly not the best.

4028316,B001I1NGHY, A1D3XQC2DIT,4.0, Very entertaining comic book movie.,"While in the Middle East providing a new-product demonstration to the US Armed Forces, super-genius playboy weaponsmaker Tony Stark is ambushed and kidnapped. To buy his freedom from his captors he must construct the new weapon he was showcasing. He decides, instead, to build a suit made of iron to help him escape, a suit powered by an electromagnet that was installed in his chest to prevent shrapnel from entering his heart. Further design modifications and refinements lead Stark to a truly amazing concept which makes him a bonafide superhero.<br /><br />The movie follows its hero (pun intended) on a series of personality changes. He goes from chick magnet to humble captive and from cocky fly boy to man on a mission. I am sure you can figure out which traits were more entertaining.<br /><br />I was impressed at first with how much hype was created for this movie. Those involved took a pretty well-known but certainly less-popular comic book character and made it one of the most highly anticipated films in at least recent history. My hat is off to them all for going beyond that and delivering such a fun and energizing movie. They also followed the story well and included at least two teasers as to what we might see sometime into the future (*cough* War Machine and The Avengers *cough*).<br /><br />The story gets in the way a few times, and it is cheesy comic book story, but I hope you can get past that. With the volume of comic books being adapted to film, most people should be pretty used to that by now. What that story does is form the environment in which the special effects can really shine.<br /><br />Tony Stark is a stronger personality (and thus a better lead) than either Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne, and Iron Man and the pace of his movie are also significantly more explosive. Since you're now questioning me, I will say that Iron Man was better than any of the Spider-Man movies. And I liked Iron Man for different reasons than Batman, so that is a hard comparison to make, but I think Batman Begins is still the better movie. And we'll see how Mr. Stark does against The Dark Knight later this summer.",Iron Man
4028317,B001I1NGHY, A1ZTE3K3EN4TS3,5.0," Finally, someone gets it right","Superhero movies are a mixed bag. Sometimes you get a good one that captures the heart of what made the comic book popular (Spider-Man, Batman Begins), and sometimes they just go all weird for no reason (Superman Returns, The Hulk). ""Iron Man"" has captured that perfect feel for a comic book movie.<br /><br />First, we go to a movie called ""Iron Man"" to SEE Iron Man, and director Favreau doesn't disappoint. We see him four times in the three different incarnations (original, plain iron, and the gold-and-red). The sequences are action-packed and perfect.<br /><br />Second, Robert Downey Jr. is dead-on as Tony Stark. He has this smirky personality yet he manages to stay down to earth at the same time. You actually feel for this character and laugh in the moments he's creating the armor (the jet boot sequences are hilarious).<br /><br />Finally, the storyline itself. It's a perfect origin story that remains true to the comics while still giving us something new. You can tell Jon has had a lot of time with the comics by giving little nods to the real comic book fans out there (wondering about War Machine? There's a hint in the movie).<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest and greatest fanboy moment of all comes after the credits have finished rolling. You've got to sit through a LOT of them, but trust me: DON'T MOVE! The final one minute sequence sets the stage perfectly for where Jon wants to take the movies in the future.<br /><br />I loved this film. I can't recommend it highly enough. I just hope they allow Jon to direct the next two AND the Avengers movie (if it ever comes out). Just like Sam Raimi captured the essence of Spider-Man in the first movie, Jon has Iron Man down pat.",Iron Man

Not bad for an actor.<br /><br />Jon Favreau updated the Iron Man mythology to the Iraqi War from Vietnam which makes better sense than trying to complete a period piece. The basic plot points are the same from the comic book.<br /><br />Tony Stark ironically gets injured from his own weapons and is saved by Youren, his cell mate in Afghanistan. Arab mercenaries have captured Stark and force him to build the Jericho, his ultimate weapon. Of course, he builds the Iron Man suit to fight them off and get away. Back in Malibu, California, Tony shuts down the weapons manufacture section of Stark Industries and works on perfecting the Iron Man suit. Meanwhile, his dad's friend and Tony's mentor, Obadiah Stern, goes nuts and tries to take over the company (of course). He steals the technology that keeps Stark alive and uses it to power his own Iron Man-like suit to reek havoc all over L.A. Of course Iron Man gets up and fights him off. Everyone lives happily ever after and he reveals himself to be Iron Man.<br /><br />Agent Coulson from S.H.I.E.L.D. helps Pepper Potts save Tony and assists in destroying Obadiah. Agent Coulson wanted to debrief Tony on how he escaped Afghanistan, but he never got his chance. He sets up a future appointment with Pepper Potts and exits. Nick Fury makes a post-credits appearance and tells Tony that he isn't the only superhero in the world, and tells him that he wants to talk to him about the ""Avengers Initiative"". Sets up future events for Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and of course the Avengers.<br /><br />If you're going to see or have already seen the Avengers (2012), it's best if you watch Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man and Iron Man 2.

But I have no complaints, it arrived on the due date and not damaged. The copy I got is the widescreen version, which I prefer - I have gotten some that didn't show whether it was full or widescreen format. I hate those kinds of surprises.<br />I love the movie, but then, I am a fan of this type movie; Fantastic Four, Spiderman, Iron Man, et al. I really didn't care for Robert Downey's movies before this one but I must say I really do like his rendition of Tony Stark, playboy ba-zillionaire, weapons inventor, manufacturer and now superhero. I am one of Gwyneth Paltrow's fans too. I believe she did an outstanding job in the supporting role as his secretary/confidant/almost love interest. Mr. Bridges makes a very good bad guy. I hadn't seen him as such before. He really garnered my wrath as he went about fattening his bank account at the expense of the world, as it were. Good job, Jeff. There are really 2 evil villains in this flick. The muslim fanatic and one that I never thought of until close to the end - Jeff Bridges. I really get off when the bad guys (2 of them in 2 different scenes) get their ""come-uppance"".  Being a retired Soldier who served from Vietnam into OIF and Afghanistan, I have no love lost for villains who deliberately destroy people and their lives to gain control over others for the villains' own benefit.<br />But, back to the movie. The photography and computer generated flying sequence with the 2 USAF fighters is really good, in my humble opinion.  And, as in some other movies, there is a short piece after the credits have rolled that left the door open for Iron Man II.

He holds it on his shoulders ably.<br />Like other comic book based movies, I don't care about the source material at all.<br />The only question : Is the movie entertaining - yes it is, in fact is for that reason that I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />This movie is a master class in acting from Robert - whether that be comic or dramatic.<br />What other lead actor could play Tony Stark? Granted, that is an easy question, as there are not that many real 'actors' out there at the moment.<br />The reason I say this is that Robert has to play an unsympathetic yet occasionally charming and intelligent man.<br />This in itself is a challenge - which he rises to admirably.<br />People have to work with him, but they don't have to like him - in fact, that does lead to problems for the character.<br />Of course the supporting cast are right there with him - at or near his ability level.<br /><br />The last line of the film is delivered perfectly by Robert and leads in to the next movie.<br />The last line is perfect because everything previous to it leads there logically - it is the only possible culmination in the film's world. You are left hanging on with a sense of anticipation, yet you laugh as well.<br /><br />Perhaps one day we will see a Director's Cut of this, though I won't be surprised if we don't, as it is perfect.<br /><br />If I could add one thing to this Blu-Ray set, it would be a commentary by the director and stars.<br />Very highly recommended.",Iron Man

Iron Man, alas, is the latter, at least for me:  they tend to over-emphasize special effects to make up for weaknesses in the script, have far more action than character development, and follow some pretty simple formulas.  I was hoping for better.<br /><br />That being said, the actors are very good, starting with Downey.  Perhaps it is that he is such a playboy genius type that turned me off, as opposed to a nerd like Peter Parker, who unexpectedly gains power.  I didn't identify with him much.  But he undergoes a pretty interesting transformation and he has nice chemistry with Paltrow, who is as luminous as ever.  Bridges isn't a bad bad guy, but he is lackluster.<br /><br />I did like the special effects and technology evocations.  When he flies through the air, it is fun and very beautiful.

It would be silly to try to say anything that hasn't already been said, but I rented the single-disc version; I'd been buying too many films, sight-unseen. This is one I'd buy, and that's about the best recommendation I could give!  Haven't heard much about Ms. Paltrow lately, but she's quite fine and confident in an important role. Jeff Bridges, too, always Mr. Nice guy in every film he's made, but here he shows surprising variation.

4028372,B001I1NGHY, A140XH16IKR4B0,4.0," Terrific and original, for a while","Really enjoyed this film for the first 90 minutes, until it became a predictable super robot movie. Robert Downey, Jr. is technical whiz Tony Stark, the ne'er-do well scion of a weapons manufacturer. He has a social awakening after being captured by Afghan warriors during a product demo, and decides that his company must change course. One of his first designs is a power suit, propelled by a new source of his own devising.<br /><br />Downey is perfect for the job. His dry acting style and bad-boy persona are perfect for depicting the driven and hard-driving protagonist. He is completely believable with booze or blond in hand. Gwyneth Paltrow trots out her American accent to play Stark's all-knowing assistant. Jeff Bridges is completely believable as Stark's corporate partner, uniting uncleish bonhomie with more sinister motivations. The special effects are terrific, but made believable (and often funny) with scenes of Stark test-piloting his new equipment. A scene (shown in the trailer) of Stark outrunning a couple of stealth fighters is harrowing and plenty exciting.<br /><br />Iron Man does a lot (mostly thanks to Downey) with borrowed materials. There's a know-all female assistant (a la 007's Moneypenny), a technical wunderkind (a la Batman) and foreign bad guys (a la Vin Diesel). Still, the film is rocket-solid until about the 3/4 mark, when it tumbles securely into the old cliche mismatched superhero battle. There's never a question of who will win, and it would have been refreshing if the plot had allowed for fewer explosions, close calls and destroyed cityscapes.  A quickie, surprise ending would have been better than the 20-minute, predictable mini-Armageddon that threatened to drop this review to 3 stars.<br /><br />A fun ride, with a setup (after 10 minutes of credits) for what promises to be a lame sequel.",Iron Man

4028374,B001I1NGHY, A13IKSGDYNBNQS,4.0, 3.5 stars,"This is certainly better than the latest Hulk movie, but for me it never quite reached the heights that I had hoped. The opening part of the movie is well done and the scenes when Stark is devloping the final version of the 'Iron' suit are some of the finest use of CGI I've seen. In particular where he was initially testing out its flying ability adjacent to his collection of classic cars. Great scene...<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is excellent in the leading role (reminded me of Al Pacino in fact) and it was great to see Jeff Bridges again. Gywneth Paltrow also gave a good performance.<br /><br />Where the film went downhill was the final 1/4. Much like the ending of the latest Hulk film the final battle was entirely predictable. Once again though there is a lovely cameo role for Stan Lee and the final few moments give us hope that Marvel may be preparing a film based on The Avengers.<br /><br />My review is perhaps a reflection of my age. If this film had been produced when I first read the comics (the 1970's) I would have been blown away by it. Sadly age and a somewhat more cynical view of life means that superheroes are never quite what they were. I still love the comics though!",Iron Man

4028378,B001I1NGHY, A2MFNDNS1L7D16,3.0, Pretty good comic book adaptation.,"It is also updated for our time with events fictionalized from Afganistan, the villans being terrorist, foreign & domestic. Broad enough to spawn endless sequels. Sort of like the James Bond franchise. One problem, however good James Bond is or was, Sean Connery was the best Bond. Vodka martini references aside there are some simularities between  Bond & Robert Downey's Tony Stark (Ironman). He is the best thing about this movie. Let's not forget Gwynth Paltrow as Pepper, his friend assistant & girl everything. She is absolutely fabulous. I can't see either of these gifted actors wasting their careers on too many  Ironmans. It is after all a cartoon.<br />  Tony Stark is a boy genius, smarter than everyone else & heir to a fabulous weapons producing empire. His ego is as big as his fortune but everybody loves him. He manages to get captured while on a visit to Afganistan by terrorist. While in captivity he builds Ironman & long story short, escapes. He returns home a changed man & has a revelation to change the world. He creates another better Ironman to destroy all the weapons of destruction his company has sold to the world.

4028380,B001I1NGHY, A2EDZH51XHFA9B,4.0, Fun movie.,"Iron Man (Jon Favreau, 2008)<br /><br />Wait, Jon Favreau directed this? The guy who did Elf? And Zathura? Someone must have messed up the credits, because I find it well-nigh impossible to believe that someone who could have unleashed those monstrosities on the world could make not only a credible, but an exceptionally enjoyable, action thriller. And yet here it is, in all its glory, Iron Man.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. is one of those guys who pops up in movies when he's out of rehab and either wipes the floor with the entire rest of the cast (Chaplin, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) or kind of fades into the woodwork (Gothika, a movie I'm sure everyone involved would love to forget). This is a mopping-the-floor performance, which is even more impressive given the caliber of the rest of the cast; Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub, Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow, Leslie Bibb, and Favreau himself all turn in good performances, but nothing on this screen at any time can touch Downey, who plays a much friendlier and more nave Tony Stark than I've been used to seeing in comics recently. (Interesting that The Dark Knight and the upcoming Watchmen are all about making the superheroes more human and gritty, while Iron Man wants to get back to almost golden-era-comics-like exaggeration and strong lines between the good guys and the bad guys.) As a result, the bad guys come off as even more evil, and in the opening scenes this could easily have been played in a ham-handed-racist sort of way. I don't doubt there are those who will take that interpretation away from the first half-hour of this movie, in fact, but to me it came off more like Three Kings; the terrorist-as-bad-guy approach is topical, rather than racially-based, and you could have stuck in any nationality. In other words, it's not about the Arabs.<br /><br />This is a fun movie, very well-done all around. It has the unfortunate distinction of being released in the same year as The Dark Knight, which is likely to eclipse every other superhero movie released in 2008, but it's such an entirely different film in tone that the two make very good foils for one another. Quite enjoyable, and well worth your time. ****",Iron Man

The action delivers the goods, but not at the expense of story or character.<br /><br />  Most importantly, this movie is FUN! Robert Downey Jr. is a one man party onscreen - funny, smart and compelling to watch throughout. It seems as though he's having more fun than should be legal ( I know, don't tempt him).<br /><br />  The effects are breathtaking, seamlessly switching from practical to cg without calling attention to artifice - a major feat these days. All the gadgetry seemed plausible somehow and delivered ( for me at least ) a sense of giddy wish fulfillment - I totally bought that this guy could fly around in a high tech suit of armor.<br /><br />  Gwyneth Paltrow is a pleasant surprise. I have to admit that I was ambivalent about her, but here she's great, and mines a layer of vulnerability in her character that could have easily been unrealized by lesser talent. Oh, and did I mention that she looks really HOT?!?! She looks really HOT!<br /><br />  Terrence Howard is good as the straight man and there were a couple male-bonding scenes with Downey Jr. that rang as being particularly genuine.<br /><br />  Jeff Bridges ( always a pleasure ) does a great job of taking his character from ambiguous manipulator to outright villain without any breaks in logic or motivation.<br /><br />  The movie balances humor, drama and action with a light tone while still managing a fairly serious subtext about war profiteering and global violence.<br /><br />  It all adds up to one of the most entertaining popcorn flicks around and a serious contender for 'best superhero movie' award.

4028385,B001I1NGHY, A2O91YORQH16L5,5.0," An entertainining movie, especially for the pulsating action sequences & witty dialogue!","Frankly, I could never imagine Robert Downey Jr., playing a superhero. This probably had to do with the initial impression I had from what I had read so much about him - faltering years as a drug addict & jail bird in real life.<br /><br />I last saw him as the conniving Dr Kovak in 'The Shaggy Dog', & also as the rogue special agent, John Royce, opposite the characters of Tommy Lee Jones & Wesney Snipes in the thriller action movie, 'US Marshalls', on cable television.<br /><br />With the last movie, 'The Forbidden Kingdom', in the same movie theatre, my gym buddy & I saw a brief trailer of 'Iron Man', which had sort of piqued our personal interest.<br /><br />Yesterday, my gym buddy & decided to go for a movie in the late afternoon, & we chose 'Iron Man' at Jurong Point.<br /><br />In a nut shell, 'Iron Man' was more of a CGI-boosted special effects extravaganza. I read from the papers that the movie costed US$165 million to make.<br /><br />The movie was based on a superhero character from Marvel Comics, creators of 'Spiderman', 'Fantastic Four' & 'X-men'.<br /><br />Story-wise, it had a relatively simple plot.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr., played Tony Stark, a billionaire industrialist & also an inventor extraordinaire in designing & building high tech weaponry of mass destruction for the US Army.<br /><br />His company was known as Stark Industries, founded by his late father, Howard Stark, who was involved with the Manhattan Project.<br /><br />While traveling in Afghanistan on a business trip, his convoy was ambushed in a war zone - he was injured, ironically by a shrapnel from one of his own rockets - & was kidnapped by a group of militants, headed by a lunatic who wanted to control the entire Middle East.<br /><br />Kept alive by a make-shift electro-magnet embedded above his heart, apparently designed to prevent the shrapnel from puncturing his heart, Tony was forced by his captors to build a missile with metal scraps & electronic leftovers in a cave-enclosed prison.<br /><br />Instead our hero, with his usual cool arrogance & drawing on his inventive genius, hatched an escape plan revolving around a crude metallic armoured suit -the advent of the prototype, 'Iron Man'.<br /><br />Of course, he managed to escape - with the electro-magnet over his heart intact - & eventually returned to America, seemingly a changed man after seeing the death & destruction caused by his company's weapons.<br /><br />With that, he decided arbitrarily that Stark Industries would stop producing military weapons, much to the chagrin of his mentor & associate, Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges), who somehow had other sneaky ideas of his own.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Tony began experimenting with the electro-magnet imbedded over his heart & exchanging it with a miniaturised Arc Reactor - apparently a power-yielding generator that could emit enough juice to keep his heart shrapnel-free, & at the same time, could provide adequate power to a new armoured suit he had in mind.<br /><br />So, while our hero was cranking his new armoured suit, Stane was secretly conniving with the militants in Afghanistan, who apparently had managed to salvage the original work plans of the armoured suit built in the cave during Tony's captivity.<br /><br />It was during this movie segment that I realised that Tony's unfortunate ambush in Afghanistan was all the while being set up by Stane in a futile attempt to take over Stack Industries.<br /><br />With the original work plans secured from Afghanistan, Stane managed to assemble a team of specialists to build a modified version of the metallic armoured suit, nicknamed 'Iron Monger'.<br /><br />The remaining segment of the movie - in fact, for all the excitement we were waiting for - displayed the power struggle between Tony & Stane, eventually culminating into a violent clash - with CGI special effects, of course - between the two heavy metal behemoths, 'Iron Man' & 'Iron Monger'.<br /><br />[We must accord our thanks to the ingenuity & inventiveness of the team from Stan Wilson Studios.]<br /><br />If you have the opportunity to watch the sci-fi action movie, 'Transformers', you would quickly get a good idea of the resultant rampant havoc, when two heavy metal behemoths danced, while humans & vehicles got caught beneath their fancy footwork.<br /><br />When compared with 'Spiderman', 'Fantastic Four' & 'X-men', I had this notion that 'Iron Man' was more like a slapstick comedy to me.<br /><br />The two actresses, one playing Tony's Girl Friday (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) & the perky television reporter, were primarily eye candies. I reckon they were there just to show Tony's flamboyance.<br /><br />In fact, the most fascinating gadget in the movie, to me at least, was the flash-drive-sized sonic paralysis emitter, which Stane used to harmlessly knock out his opponents. I would love to have one of that.<br /><br />Did I enjoy watching the movie at the end? I sure did. Was it entertaining? Yes, especially the action sequences & witty dialogue. Was it worth spending the two hours in the movie theatre? Yes. My gym buddy felt likewise.<br /><br />At least, I now have a different impression about Robert Downey Jr.",Iron Man
4028386,B001I1NGHY, A27P0MW8TE1JQP,5.0, IRONMAN is finally a MADE MAN!!!,"Robert Downey Jr. may not seem to fit the superhero archetype, but he is the quintessential TONY STARK! Downey is egotistical, edgy; both smug and smooth, comic book fans will quickly associate him with the flawed, sometimes less than heroic head of STARK Industries and IRONMAN himself. This isn't the only good bit of casting Gwyneth Paltrow is sooo perfect as the Moneypennyish Ms. (Pepper) Potts, Stark's personal assistant and unrequited love interest. Terrence Howard as Tony's right-hand-man Col. Rhodes (and War Machine in the future-sequel) is great as is Jeff Bridges as Stark Industries co-CEO and more (as the ominous poster would indicate).<br /><br />The 1963 Marvel comic, holds up well in the 21st century, the billionaire weapon-making industrialist, has a change of heart (sort of literally) after discovering his weapons aren't always used on just the bad guys. He reinvents himself (also, sort of literally) and returns home to more altruistic designs, but discovers he may have been betrayed.<br /><br />State-of-the-art FX contains some of the ultimate transforming sequences in which Tony Stark suiting-up never gets old (infinitely better than the NFL graphics). Equally cool are the aerial combat sequences with old Iron-head zipping `round pilots. The chrome-dome-computer-generated finale maybe one of the most clich&eacute;d moments, but even this is forgivable, next to so many other stand-out moments in which the film shines (including the perfect proclamation of Tony Stark in the films final moments! Starks ego is appropriately served!)<br /><br />Actor/ director Jon Favreau, who cameos amusingly enough, as Stark's driver, may have been a risky pick for such a huge property, especially without a notable hit-list. But, Favreau must be a fan or at least understands what comic fans want, as well as grasping the needs action/popcorn fare. Props to you Mr. Favreau, this AIN'T NO HULK! I can't wait for the sequel, with more drinking for Tony (no rehab research needed for Downey there) and more flying for Rhodes.  Why not the Avengers, too?<br /><br />Yes co-creator Stan Lee shows up, this time with an entourage!<br />Stay `till after the credits roll or you'll be furious....FURIOUS!!!",Iron Man
4028387,B001I1NGHY, A13E0ARAXI6KJW,5.0," A Superhero Epic with Wit, Heart, True Political Relevance and Downey's Knowing Work","Casting Robert Downey Jr. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0784011680"">Chaplin</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XCZGV8"">Zodiac</a>) in the title role turns out to be a masterstroke as the beleaguered actor slips easily into all the complexities of a brilliant scientist who also happens to be a billionaire industrialist and a hedonistic playboy whose every pleasure-seeking habit has turned into a death-defying addiction. The textured part of Tony Stark so mirrors Downey's former tabloid-headline-grabbing life that the actor can't help but inform the role with layers of resonance and irony that elevate what could have been a more cookie-cutter superhero epic. At the same time, director Jon Favreau (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002F6BRE"">Elf</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DBHX4M"">Zathura</a>) has more on his mind than creating another heavily stylized comic book myth, as he spends the first part of the film on establishing the realistic context for his hero's circumstances in rugged, war-torn terrain of Afghanistan. No less than four writers were recruited for the screenplay - Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway - on top of the original work by Stan Lee and his creative team at Marvel Comics. Usually having too many hands is a warning sign of a bad, neutralized movie but not this time - this is smart, provocative entertainment that doesn't forget it's also a popcorn flick with plenty of special effects, nonstop action and an unsubtle sense of good versus evil.<br /><br />The story has Stark, the head of his own multinational corporation specializing in the manufacture of state-of-the-art, mass destruction weaponry, in Afghanistan demonstrating a new guided missile that can launch a multitude of smaller missiles aimed at individual targets. His military convoy is ambushed by insurgents who kill the soldiers escorting him. Stark survives due to the quick-thinking ingenuity of a local Afghan physician who implants a device in Stark's chest to ensure the remaining shrapnel left in his body doesn't travel to his heart. Stark's captors demand that he build a missile like the one he just demonstrated, but instead, he makes an elaborate armored suit and blasts his way out of the cave where he was held hostage. Lots of carnage inevitably ensues, but Stark's miraculous escape sets the stage for the rest of the story. Transformed by his traumatic, three-month experience overseas, Stark has a change of heart which has detrimental ramifications on his company but also allows him to follow his monomaniacal pursuit of building a sleeker, more powerful version of the suit he built in captivity. Three people, in particular, are impacted by Stark's unpredictable actions - his military liaison and best friend Lt. Colonel Jim (""Rhodey"") Rhodes; Stark's cagey second-in-command at Stark Industries, Obadiah Stone; and Stark's devoted personal assistant Pepper Potts.<br /><br />With impressive agility, the often underappreciated Downey makes Stark's transformation palpable and brings surprising conviction to a role that must have seemed absurd on paper. Favreau's other casting decisions also pay dividends though some more than others. Shorn of his thick hair and sporting a salt-and-pepper beard, Jeff Bridges, another actor who never seems to get his due, is still recognizable from his trademark grin and plays the avuncular, villainous Stone with great relish. Credit Bridges for not overdoing what could have been an excessive Willem Dafoe-like turn in the first <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKCH"">Spider-Man</a>. One suspects that Terrence Howard will have more to do in the sequel as Rhodey since he is not called on to do much in this first installment except provide support and official alibis. Playing the distressed female again after a similar role as Polly Perkins in Kerry Conran's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IIPIK"">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</a>, Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't have much more to play here as Pepper Potts, but she makes the most of a mostly observational role and effortlessly delivers some of the film's more amusing lines. All the production values are top-notch - as they have to be for this type of franchise - and special mention should be made of J. Michael Riva's elaborate production design (Stark's Malibu estate is quite an eye-catcher), Matthew Libatique's crisp cinematography, and the dozens involved with the seamless CGI effects. Make sure to stay after the credits in order to see a surprise final scene which gives a hint of what the sequel may be about.",Iron Man
4028388,B001I1NGHY, A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,3.0," Like the Tin Man, Iron Man Lacked Heart","Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a genius with technology.  He inherited Stark Enterprises from his father, and has turned it into the leader in international weapons.  He is wealthy beyond imagination, and lives the playboy life to a hilt, spending as much time as possible drinking, gambling, and pursuing anything in a skirt.<br /><br />On a trip to Afghanistan to demonstrate his newest weapon, things go wrong and he is kidnapped by a gang of terrorists.  What he sees there changes his outlook on his business.  After three months in captivity, Stark manages to escape.  He returns home determined to change the direction of his company.  This does sit well with the board or Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), his father's partner.  Will the new suit he is building help him with his goals?<br /><br />The biggest problem with this movie is it is an origin story.  As a result, much of the movie is slow, even for someone like me who is unfamiliar with the character.  What we do get in the way of action scenes are wonderful and had me on the edge of my seat.  The climax didn't quite make sense, but that's worth noting only in passing.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the special effects were great, especially the shots from Iron Man's point of view.  And the robot assistants were very funny, proving a nice balance to some of the darker moments.<br /><br />The biggest problem the movie has is the characters.  Even with all the time spent creating Iron Man, we aren't given time to get to know the characters.  This is especially problematic for Tony who comes across as an egotistical jerk at first.  While his character softens, I never fully warmed up to him.  The other characters are only given one or two notes, and that isn't enough to make us truly care for any of them.<br /><br />Now this isn't a reflection on the top notch actors.  In addition to the two already mentioned, we've got Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow.  They all did the best job they could making the thin characters come to life.  I will admit that I couldn't get past Robert Downey Jr. and his past problems when looking at Tony.  It's more of a personal problem, but it was another stumbling block in any attempts to warm up to Tony.<br /><br />To me, the flaws were equal to the strengths, making this a fun but shallow superhero movie.",Iron Man
4028389,B001I1NGHY, A2XNOB1T796Y6B,5.0, W-O-W....,"Before I say anything, I have to say that I reluctantly saw this film. I was mildly curious about it (especially considering it's RD Jr's first big film in a while), but not really enough to want to pay to see it in the theaters. However, my father wanted to see it & I went. Boy was I glad that I did.<br /><br />The movie starts off with an action scene as well as a  bit of an info dump about Tony Stark for the newcomers like me. It doesn't last too overly long, so as not to bore the fans who are well versed in the lore of Iron Man. From there the movie can honestly be divided into three parts. The first concerns Stark's time as a prisoner of war and how he frees himself with the help of another prisoner (the birth of the first suit). The second concerns Stark's improvements of the suit as well as on the technology that is keeping him alive & how Stark tests out the suit. This is easily the most light hearted and thrilling part of the movie. The third is when Stark begins to discover who is behind the sale of his weapons to terrorists & the final showdown with the big baddie. All of these parts flow seamlessly into each other and overall the film is very cohesive. The ending had to have been one of the most awesome I've ever seen, although I must admit that I missed the bonus at the end of Nick Fury (I had to look for it on the net to see it afterwards).<br /><br />The acting was all first rate and I thoroughly enjoyed that the director & crew decided to bring out Paltrow's natural beauty rather than slather her face with makeup. It really lent an edge of ""realism"" to her character. The soundtrack was also incredibly good and it all fit the movie well. All in all, I'd give this film a 5/5. It deserves it. I may rate it lower after rewatching it at home, but at the moment I have to say that I really enjoyed it.",Iron Man
4028390,B001I1NGHY, A3GAY5VH2LDFWK,4.0, 4 1/2! Another great Marvel production,"""Iron Man"" Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Directed by Jon Favreau<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is head of the extremely successful weapons manufacturer Stark Industries. Tony heads to Afghanistan for a demonstration of his latest creation. Unfortunately on the return trip Stark's military convoy is attacked and Tony is taken captive. His captors demand that he build a missile for them. Tony discovers much to his dismay, that the militia that has captured him is well armed with weapons from none other Stark Industries. His former cavalier attitude about his weapons changes and he decides to move his company into a different direction but first he has to create his means of escape...<br /><br />This was another great addition to the Marvel stable. I can't speak for the die hard Ironman fans about how true the movie is to the comics (I was always a Wolverine Fan) but I think overall the story was well told and well thought out.<br /><br />The Good: I was a little bit skeptical at first but Robert Downey Jr. actually portrayed the Tony Stark Character very well. The movie overall was well cast. I think Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for her role as Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges (formerly the Dude) was very convincing in his role as Obidiah Stane. As always look for Stan Lee to make a cameo but this time he actually plays a known person and it was pretty funny even though very brief.<br /><br />The special effects and action sequences didn't disappoint. The flight sequences were all very fast paced and had good intensity. The suit was very well done and stayed true to the comics from what I've seen.<br /><br />The sound track was also good with tracks from A/C D/C, Black Sabeth and Suicidal tendencies.<br /><br />The Bad: For me nothing. As I said if you are a die hard fan you won't be able to help yourself at picking apart any inaccuracies from the comic to movie translation. There was a little bit of shamless Audi product placement but that is to be expected.<br /><br />Overall: This was another great addition to the Marvel stable.

4028391,B001I1NGHY, A1CQGAPQMN41LV,3.0," Brainless and borderline nonsensical, but still an enjoyable slice of hokum","Given all the praise and excitement surrounding The Dark Knight, the superhero movie Iron Man released just a few weeks earlier was somewhat overshadowed. However, reviews of Iron Man were almost universally positive at the time, so I was looking forward to sitting down and enjoying the movie.<br /><br />The resurgent Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, a hyper-rich genius engineer and unstoppable womaniser who builds extremely lethal weapons for the US military. His latest invention is a massive multi-warhead variation on the 'bunker-buster' missile, one that is meant to level entire Afghan mountain ranges. Stark is kidnapped by stereotypical Afghan terrorists during a demonstration of his new weapon and forced to build them some newer and more lethal versions of the same weapon. Stark is aided in his work by a gentle local educated Afghan man who is brought in as a translator but in the space of about ten minutes has convinced Stark that making massive destructive weapons isn't good for his soul and he needs to change. Stark, despite being under constant 24-hour video surveillance, is able to build a massive robot suit armed with flamethrowers and a jetpack instead of the promised missile, and is able to effect an escape, although sadly not to the theme tune from The A-Team.<br /><br />Having checked that I hadn't made an error and picked up a copy of a comedy movie by accident, I continued watching in mounting disbelief as Stark returns to the USA as a new, more moral man, deeply changed by his horrifying experiences in the Afghan mountains. The newer, more caring Stark decides to build a more uber version of his metal suit so he can personally go off and slaughter the terrorists with rocket launchers and flamethrowers. Of course, hijinks ensue and the story ends in a series of massive explosions. Who would have thought?<br /><br />Iron Man is a deeply stupid movie with plot holes and logical flaws so vast they render the story almost nonsensical in places. However, the movie remains brainlessly entertaining thanks to the almost single-handed efforts of Robert Downey Jr., who was clearly enjoying himself far too much making this hokum. His portrayal of Stark works excellently, despite the highly dubious writing, and I suspect his best moments were all ad-libbed. Suffice to say, without its star working above and beyond the call of duty, this movie would be a total failure. Gwyneth Paltrow stands around being, well, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges manfully deals with a curious baldness-beard combination. There's also a lot of guff about a new energy source Stark spontaneously created in his Afghan cave that dozens of the finest scientists in the world cannot replicate in their state-of-the-art labs, but none of it really matters.<br /><br />Iron Man (***) is quite possibly the most sloppily-written film I've seen since Pearl Harbour, but it's also a lot of fun, as long as you strictly remember to put your brain in neutral before watching it.",Iron Man
4028392,B001I1NGHY, AHBNPMHDWZ7SB,5.0," ""I am Iron Man.""","Iron Man was a huge surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. Going into the summer of 2008, my attention was completely preoccupied with The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk, Kung Fu Panda, Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, Indiana Jones 4, Wanted, Hellboy II, Wall-E, Step Brothers and The Mummy 3. All of which were very hyped up titles that had people lining up for them. But, among them was one of the best comic book movies ever made. As much as I love The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder (they're in my top three favorite all-time movies), I think that Iron Man is superior to both of them in some ways. It is highly entertaining all the way through. It doesn't matter if you like Superheroes, or not. There is something in this film for just about everyone. The few action scenes are top notch. My personal favorite is the scene when Iron Man returns to the Middle East to destroy all of his weapons. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. was beyond perfect as Tony Stark. I am always glad to see A-listers give their all in these types of films because it proves that they are not just for children and geeks (honestly, we all still have a little of both in us). The rest of the amazing cast consists of Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and even Samuel L. Jackson in a surprise post-credits cameo. I also have to mention the director, Jon Favreau. I only knew him from comedies and tv, but he did a great job with this big blockbuster.<br /><br />Despite the great action, direction , and superb casting, the real key to this movie's excellence is the script. The writing is not quite as deep and dark as The Dark Knight, but for a supposedly ""summer popcorn action flick"", it is right on par. It never hurts to get a team of actual comic book writers along with the creator himself, Stan The Man, to guide you and tell you what fits, and what doesn't. That is the only way to make a comic book character come to life, just as he is on the pages. And in the end it will always pay off with the most important group in the audience, the fans. I cannot say that without admitting something though. I was never an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, although he does make an appearance in alot of my books. But I am very familiar with the character, not only from my comics that he is in, but also the cartoon from the 90's. I still try to catch episodes of the cartoon to this day. The reason I never got into his comic arc is because, I honestly had no interest in the villains he fought, except for the Hulk. Most of his villains were just big robots and monsters (Godzilla was actually one of them). With that said, I was still happy to see that they chose a very conventional first villain, Iron Monger. As long as they never make a movie with M.O.D.O.K., I will be happy.<br /><br />My only complaint about this movie is how scarce the action is. There are only really three scenes of action in total. I know it may seem a little hypocritical for me to complain about the action in Iron Man and give it a 90%, when I gave The Dark Knight 100%, and it had even less action than Iron Man. But the difference between the two is that Iron Man is an action movie, but in my opinion, The Dark Knight is a drama. Alot of people would probably disagree with that statement, but after watching both films many many times, that's the feeling I get about them. The action scenes that it does have are beautiful though. I just think Jon Favreau is not an action director, so he played it safe. In the end, that may have been why Iron Man was so great. I was just really surprised that Iron Man became one of my favorite movies. It reminds me of how I felt about Star Trek. I had my doubts, but those doubts were completely shattered after seeing it.<br /><br />I'll keep this very short because I cannot pretend to be a pro. As far as I can tell, the Picture Quality is reference material through and through. Grain is persistent thoughout, but that only means that they didn't scrub this beautiful transfer clean (which would have taken details away along with the grain). The beautiful effects by ILM are on full display, and i saw no obvious flaws. The same can be said for the audio too. I'm working with a very modest Home Theatre, but I can tell the difference between a good and poor soundtrack. I couldn't hear any apparent flaws. Fine work. As far as the Special Features fo, I loved them. Plain and simple. I just wish there was a damn audio commentary. Commentaries are essential to me, and I cannot help but dock the extras a whole point for there not being one. The one that Favreau did for Iron Man 2 was exactly what we want in a commentary, so it was a missed opportunity. Otherwise, the extras were brilliant.<br /><br />8.5/10",Iron Man

4028405,B001I1NGHY, A1CHOKV10NEI8X,4.0," Grab popcorn, disengage brain, enjoy!","If you can ignore the product placement.<br /><br />An excellent rendition of a comicbook with a surprisingly good performance by Robert Downey Jr.  Gwyneth Paltrow was, of course, superlative, and Jeff Bridges was unexpectedly good as a villain.  It would be easy to wax poetical about sins and redemption, friendships, betrayal, a man unable to cope with a good woman and drowning his sorrows with less worthy ones, etc, but I'll leave that for the freshman English students.<br /><br />It was a rollicking good action flick.  Flying armor suits, bad guys you can really hate, cliff-hanging escapes from life threatening situations,a good guy who becomes more loveable than he starts out, chases, shoot-outs, a sidekick with more style than brains (what one would expect from a fighter-jock) and a beautiful love interest.  Yup, blocks are all checked.  All of this executed very competently, and well acted.<br /><br />If only they had been a little more discrete with product placement.  The Bulgari watch was very emblematic of this.  Like the watch, the movie had an excellent mechanism in terms of plot and production values.  Like the watch, the brand names were more than a little bit over-done.<br /><br />Still, the movie was very enjoyable.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court",Iron Man

Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />This is one of those rare ones, like The Lightning Thief, it is new Popcorn Entertainment. It ain't real entertainment, it is popcorn entertainment. For most of the movie, I enjoyed the mind-numbing action and the special effects, cheesy lines and everything else that goes good on movie snacks. Don't expect this to be the companion of The Dark Knight and Incredible Hulk, this is more along the companions of Superman The Movie except modern.<br /><br />One thing I found intreging is that people disrespect Robert Downey Jr., he is a great actor, I definatly like his personality. Sherlock Holmes, stuff like that. I don't think this movie DOES or DOES NOT deserve it's amount of fame, it's just fun and nothing else. It's better than what Avatar got, when it deserved nothing. Avatar was a bad movie! But, I don't wanna spend every single one of my reviews talking about how much I hate avatar.<br /><br />Another thing I'm liking is the choice of AC/DC for the music score. Any movie would go great with some AC/DC my friend! (A little Metallica wouldn't hurt either.) The characters are all blockbuster hollywood of 2008, heck, that's how everything feels like, and what's to say that that's a bad thing? This ain't one of the best comic book movies ever, but it is definatly fun.<br /><br />Well, that's it, don't expect the experience of your life just expect fun. There is not much more to say since the whole movie is pretty predictable in that aspect. One more thing:<br /><br />I AM DA CA$HMAN, SIGNING OFF YES I AM.",Iron Man

4028443,B001I1NGHY, A25CQTB313XDWO,4.0, Great Fe-rocious Movie,"Iron Man is a must see motion picture for those who love not only comic books but also those who want to see a form of entertainment with a myriad of great action sequences and special effects. Robert Downey, Jr., I must say, is perfectly cast for the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Arguably, he is a larger than life individual who is playing a character who seems to be, well, larger than life.<br /><br />From a philosophical and social standpoint, one can assert that the Iron Man story portrayed on the silver screen effectively elicits the advantages and disadvantages of being charismatic and brilliant. Like Reed Richards, perhaps the greatest scientific mind in the Marvel Universe, Stark is a highly intelligent individual whose talents draw him recognition. However, unlike so many of the other big brains such as Mr. Fantastic, Stark is a socialite who both embraces and is embraced by crowds. He is a celebrity, a lady's man, and a leading industrialist who has achieved international fame. And it is because of these traits that Stark is surrounded by those who claim to be his friends or fans but who may actually be, at best, people who are trying to vicariously live off the greatness of Tony Stark or, at worst, plagiaristic, corporate sharks who want to build Stark up with hopes of eventually tearing him down.<br /><br />If the focus had merely been upon the social interactions of Stark and how he could maintain his levels of success both publicly and privately, a great movie would nonetheless be developed. But lest we forget, Tony Stark is not just those roles mentioned above. Despite the many hats he has worn, there is one ultimate alloying of Stark the man and Stark the hero: TONY STARK IS IRON MAN!<br /><br />And it is those scenes that define the transition and transformation from Stark the noteworthy Fortune 500 figure to The Invincible Iron Man that make the story enjoyable, even occasionally hilarious. The Tony Stark in this movie (as well as the Iron Man comic book) is not a stereotypical nerd, for unlike Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four, he does not necessarily succeed with his experiments the first or second time around. In fact, he is more like Thomas Edison; he has to do it over and over......until he finally gets it right!<br /><br />There are several angles and aspects by which one can ascertain this particular cinematic experience. For those who are curious about what separates Iron Man from the other excellent movies to date that are based upon the superheroes of Marvel Comics, let me say this. Tony Stark, in order to become a hero, pursued excellence with his great mind and his unique social abilities in a way that his gifts and the developments thereof would cause him to deal with those who, over time, would see themselves, by comparison, in the proverbial Sea of Mediocrity and thus become jealous not only at the interpersonal level but also at the highest ranks within government intelligence.<br /><br />If you want to see one of the top five movies of the summer, if not the year, then go see Iron Man.

This means that you must set aside your rational understanding of physics and science and just relax and enjoy what is a marvelous adventure. Everyone knows that Robert Downey Jr. has some serious character flaws but if there was ever any doubt regarding his acting ability this film should put that to rest. There is no doubt but that Downey is one of the best actors around today -- maybe even the best.  This screenplay in the hands of less capable actors could have been campy or dull but Bridges, Downey, and Paltrow turn it into a really excellent film.  In fact the acting is so good thoroughout that Paltrow's performance is easily overlooked but she is marvelous at showing her love for Downey while he is totally oblivious to her or to his unrecognized love for her.<br /><br />To some this may appear to be an anti-war film or a film with some sort of moral message and maybe they are right -- I really don't know all I know is that this was a really enjoyable film and Downey's performance made it all worth while.<br /><br />I did stay through the seemingly endless credits to see the 30 sec tag scene that foreshadows the sequel.

I have a few quibbles with the script, but nothing that serious. {Like how did Obie manage to control that giant power suit so well when he had no time to practice his Ironman Kung-Fu?}<br /><br />My real quibble is with the Blu-ray transfer team.  They did not implement DTS-HD Master Audio, which is the top-flight audio standard Blu-Ray offers.  They should have used DTS-HD MA.  Also, there is some softness and grainy noise in the picture occasionally.  I found this very surprising.  Certainly, a movie just released this summer cannot have had time to degrade on a media shelf somewhere in North Hollywood.  Certainly, such a recent master must have had many purely digital elements.  Certainly, they should have been able to avoid some of the problems associated with film transfer?<br /><br />I am afraid Paramount is still figuring out Blu-Ray after having been entrenched in the HD-DVD camp.",Iron Man

4028454,B001I1NGHY, A3FVAWZNKW9GX,5.0, Redemption Found in An Iron Clad Heart,"I saw Iron Man. I loved it.<br /><br />Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., owns a weapons manufacturer. On a trip to demonstrate a new missile, the Jericho, which knocks out a wall of defenses with many small bombs deployed from a single shot, he is captured. His captors are essentially killers Al-Qaeda. They want him to build this device.<br /><br />In a cave, he realizes he cannot escape on his own. He'll build the bomb, and then, they'll kill him. Bad deal. He secretly builds the Iron Man suit and gets back home. Fellow captive and engineering genius Dr. Yinsen cautions him, ""Don't waste your life."" Yinsen gives his life to save Tony's.<br /><br />While in captivity, he sees that his weapons are used by the enemy. Why? How?<br /><br />He had been a sleazy, rich, indulgent womanizer. Now, he sees the light. Not only is he a new man with his morals, but, with his view about weapons. His Iron Man suit will be used for good, by him. Specifically, he will use it to take down the enemy's stock of Stark Industry weapons.<br /><br />One problem. His partner, Obadiah Stane, is in cahoots with the enemy. He sanctioned Stark's capture, and is the one selling Stark products. He double crosses the enemy, and acquires the Iron Man prototype suit and plans.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), previously seen as a plain assistant, starts looking good to Tony Starks. Both realize they are nowhere without the other.<br /><br />What now?<br /><br />Go see it. Surprise ending.<br /><br />When you do, look for Stan Lee. He's the Hugh Hefner lookalike.<br /><br />The acting is solid, with Downey spot-on for the role. Paltrow is replaceable. Jeff Bridges, as Obadiah, is excellently cast. Shaun Toub as Dr. Yinsen carries the role impressively, though we only see him in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Terrence Howard as Lt. Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes is the weakest link, as he comes across too feminine and insipid to be the kind of leader he should be as the liaison between Stark Industries and the military.<br /><br />The movie's messages: heroes are men who do the right thing even if it means sacrifice, and, bigger guns do not necessarily lead to peace. The message is conflicted, however, as it is bigger guns which save the day (with some good ol' experience thrown in).<br /><br />The idea of not wasting one's life -- having purpose and vision -- comes through well. This brings the movie from sheer pulp to something with depth. Tony Stark is not perfect; some of his faults are indefensible. He is, though, a man on a mission. That's a pretty good idea for all of us.<br /><br />Violent at times, horrific at others -- the terrorists here are put in their proper light, but as they murder, it is very realistic and frightening.<br /><br />Sensuality -- Tony Starks is a womanizer, and we see evidence of this, especially as he seduces an equally arrogant Brown University graduate and magazine writer Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb). When Pepper Potts is escorting her out, she refers to her as trash.<br /><br />Would I bring kids? Probably not. PG-13 it is rightly rated.<br /><br />Look for a sequel.

4028455,B001I1NGHY, A31R0HQR76F84L,3.0, Should have gone a different direction.,"My biggest complaint about this movie is that the ""big showdown battle"" was between Downey and Bridges and not Downey and Say.....the kind of people who kidnapped him such as Terrorists and other scum of the Earth. I think people have never gotten a sense of ""payback"" after 911 and this could have been the perfect film to do just that. Instead it's wasted on two so called Business partners and of course one turns on the other.<br />The film was fun and enjoyable for the most part, but i regret buying it for my collection.",Iron Man
4028456,B001I1NGHY, A3M6RVUVZOQZLB,5.0," Suit up, Ironman, time to soar...!","Review Number 447.<br /><br />What has red plates, an arc converter, firepower, the ability to fly, and Robert Downey, Jr inside? Yes, I know you know--Iron Man! What with the magic of movie making tricks, a great cast, a creative director, and the edgy, cagey star power of Downey, why wouldn't this movie be a hit? A BIG HIT!<br /><br />The really wild aspect of this movie is that it does not have the feel or look of a comic book. It's more akin to true sci-fi--take a man who has barbs of a modern bomb in his chest, barbs that will migrate to his heart without a battery attached to keep them stationary. Then take this same man who is a munitions genius holed up in a cave with crazed, power hungry Middle Easterners as his captors, demanding the Jericho bomb for their very own. They have many of his weapon types with the puzzling question--how did these weapons end up in their possession?<br /><br />Tony Stark, son of a powerful, very wealthy weapons designer and maker, and godson of Jeff Bridges' character who assumed the mantle of the company at the founder's death, finally has an awakening to the true meaning of destruction while a captive. He must escape with the mysterious, multi-lingual man who assists him in the creation of an escape device--an iron suit, indestructible (for a short while).<br /><br />I've given a background for Iron Man--how he came to be, his inner turmoil leading to a change in professional and personal direction. Robert Downey Jr. makes this all work with his slim, but not powerful physique. He's just Joe Average physically--well, better than that because he has no fat, but he is not bulked up. It is his face, those eyes that make his every close-up so conducive to the building of the story. In his early middle age, Downey has IT and makes IT work in his character and role.<br /><br />Other actors contribute as much: Jeff Bridges (always a favorite actor) becomes an excellent villain. My gosh, in his first scene the viewer knows  he will be a villain. He looks the part! Terrence Howard continues to build his impressive resume here, although he doesn't have as much to do, but his last line sets his role in a sequel.<br /><br />Although Gwenth Paltrow plays the handy girl assistant-- again, the viewer knows that her role will also expand in the future.  As for the S.H.E.I.L.D. agent, I expected him to say ""the Other Christine"" at any moment.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is an exciting movie. I expect to see it again! What's the record for reviews of a movie on Amazon? I expect this one will break that record! Once a person views this film she just has to praise it--it's that good (if you like violence and excitement and creative genius and heroes and desire to do the right thing and....see what I mean?)",Iron Man

Don Cheadle was an injustice to Terence Howard. In the pursuit of perfection as viewed in ""The Making of"", the personalities of the characters got nixed. If it was because of comments akin to Rick Sanchez or Mel Gibson that did Terence Howard in, then they are baseless paranoic delusions.

4028465,B001I1NGHY, A2EZTM9WY5B5IL,3.0, Too Long,"What I liked best about this movie was not everyone spoke English. And there were no subtitles! Here's the negative side: I could not believe a guy, who is almost dead, held prisoner in a cave, could possibly set up a foundry and a lab. He built himself a version of Robo-Cop. Meanwhile the Taliban's watching him on closed circuit TV. Needless to say, Downey escapes and gets back to the United States. But not before his robot character crashes and the Taliban pieces fragments back together again.<br /><br />Downey is so smart, he can build robotry control circuits from scratch like he's making pasta. In the film he is engaged by two jet fighters, but flies faster and smarter. I did not like Jeff Bridges, as he always plays himself in these films. This was poor casting.<br /><br />This plot is too much to believe. Kids will love it because kids believe anything. The movie technicians did a great job assembling parts; special effects people get an A+.<br /><br />I would take my kids to see the movie. I would not take my wife, because she would rather go shopping for shoes. Oh, one last point, the role of the Air Force colonel was miscast also.

4028467,B001I1NGHY, AIBSC3DOO3UHR,3.0," Good overall, but flawed.","Overall, I enjoyed this movie alot. The special effects were good as was the action, and it had many genuinely funny moments.<br /><br />The first flaw comes in the form of inappropriate content with the pole dancers in the plane and the one night stand (which could have been implied without actually having the scene in the bed - just to show Tony's self absorbed nature at the beginning of the film). These scenes added nothing to the movie and are completely inappropriate for a movie you know is targetted towards kids (why else all the Iron Man toys?).<br /><br />The other flaw is a plot point. After his experience, I would think it more believable if his first reaction was to start secret investigations to find out how terrorists got his weapons, rather than deciding to stop making them altogether. (After seeing the American soldiers slautered around me, I would still be interested in making things that would give THEM the advantage in any such future engagements.)",Iron Man

4028470,B001I1NGHY, A1PPOI55JO8VU1,4.0, A Man of Iron is Sronger than a Man of Steel,"While I was waiting for my ticket for Iron-Man, I got to thinking, 'Who actually has heard of Iron-Man before?'. He's not a mainstream hero like Batman or Spidy, he hasen't been to big on the comic book scene, but still, a movie was made. Whats gonna be next, a Green Lantern flick?<br /><br /> The plot of Iron Man is kept semi-simple, portraying Mr. Billionaire Tony Stark as a Middle Eastern hostage, forging a super-soilder suit to escape, then expanding on the idea, which turns into Iron Man. Corperate greed, double-dealing, and press coverups show a diffrent side of superheros that we've never witnessed in movies(this is before Dark Knight). Ditching the famed cookie cutter look at hero's, Iron Man dives a layer deeper into realism for a superhero.<br /> On the down side, having the movie take more time showing the 'Fast Life' of celebraties and less of the actual Iron Man kicking booty made this feel like more a prequal, rather than the first instalment. Seeing the hero in a suit with a tie more than a metal one isen't too heroic, often he'd talk at mawk speed with press, giving sarcastic responises, which is 'chic' I guess, but not needed for a Hero movie. This was more of an orgin story on how the suit was built, and Tony's life, more than him donning his matalick tights. But when they where donned, hell hath no fury, and coolness, than Tony Stark. We need to see more of that.<br /><br /> Just as a side note, has anyone seen the trend right now of Superhero movies and how the baddies are dark versions of themselves? SpiderMan 3 had Venom, a dark suited villian that had exact same powers. The new Hulk featured a bigger, badder, and darker shade of green Hulk as the nemises, now Iron Man features a guy in a big grey body suit with sooped up Iron Man poweres. Is this gonna be the trend now?",Iron Man

4028474,B001I1NGHY, A319SKSB556033,3.0, RoboCop too,"Despite being a huge hit and a definite crowd-pleaser, Iron Man is actually quite a shallow, unexciting movie. It's not something you can make a night out of watching once you've seen it once. I'd classify it as a movie you can have on while doing the ironing or something. It's a pure cheeseburger movie with no substance at all.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Downey Jnr. in a star-remaking role) is one of the top genius minds on the planet, but when he's captured by generic Arabs he secretly creates a robotic armor costume to break free. Impressed by the suits potential and abilities he refines it upon returning to safe, sunny Malibu. As soon as the suit is ready to go he jets off to Arabistan to kill/subdue the enemy with lots of safe, bloodless action. Beneath this flimsy plot his right-hand man Obediah Stane conspires to steal Stark Industries from right underneath him.<br /><br />There is no depth to Iron Man. The plot involving the Arabs is resolved fairly quickly and the succeeding plot feels like a last-minute afterthought. The Arabs have no mentioned affiliation or motives, since we don't want to scare the kiddies. The action is just a little too cartoonish, and Iron Man himself just looks like a video-game character. There's no tangible edge to this film and very little of it feels real or credible.<br /><br />The ending features the hero and villain inside robotic armor, one lean, one monstrous, clobbering eat other until one of them falls over and doesn't get up again. I'm sure I saw they exact same thing in a movie back in 1990. What was it called again?<br /><br />There's a scene after the credits that sets-up the long, long, long in-development Avengers movie, which I honestly could not care less about.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks good in 2.40:1 1080p with Dolby TrueHD sound and plenty of extras.",Iron Man
4028475,B001I1NGHY, AWGPEXO9M8R7Q,3.0, Devil in the Details for Blu-Ray,"Let me start off by saying that Iron Man is a great movie. It's easily one of the best Marvel Comics based movies I've seen, right up there with the X-Men movies and the Spiderman movies. The special effects are great and make it one of the most Blu-Ray worthy movies I've seen in a while. The action is top notch and Robert Downey Jr. nails the role of Tony Stark dead on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to knock down the rating for one simple reason. The blue ring of death that occurs because of the player trying to download the BDLive content is inexcusable. Basically, you absolutely cannot play the movie because your Blu-Ray player is trying to access web-based special content. I'm sure this will be cleared up once traffic to the server is cleared up. Until then, there's a problem.<br /><br />Yes there it is a simple matter to go into your settings and turn off the internet connection or disable BDLive. But there is no mention on the package that this blue ring of death could happen nor any mention of how to clear it up. I had no way of knowing that this is what the problem was. I came pretty close to taking my copy back to the store I got it from and exchanging it for another disk that would have the same problem. It's only because I happened to see G.Chance's review that I saved myself the trouble. Thanks G.Chance. That's well worth a helpful vote.<br /><br />I paid Blu-Ray prices for a Hi-Def movie, not for a puzzle with no clue as how to solve it. Quality Control really dropped the ball on this one.<br /><br />However, like I said, this is a great movie. I'm sure once the server traffic lightens up, things will work fine.

4028481,B001I1NGHY, AMPTUVYLEH4T8,2.0, Marvelous Script?,"Hype can work against anything that is mediocre. If it doesn't live up to the hype, it becomes a bigger disappointment than would have without the hype. This movie, Ironman, was just an ordinary action movie. Personally, there are too may holes in the plot to live up to Stan Lee's reputation. When you are expecting the detail and original ideas generated in comics or graphic novels you know that plot lines and details really matter. This movie didn't live up to hype or the methods they could have used to tell this story.<br /><br />As Marvel's first major production movie it was just OK. Again, I was expecting to be told a story of Tony Stark, Stark Enterprises, Obediah, Pepper and war, that's what I got. However, with the wealth of truly original story lines and material generated over 30 years of Ironman I expected the story to move and excite me. It didn't. I think they took pains to make Tony Stark and the birth of this franchise believable and that made the first 25 minutes slow.<br /><br />There are many different time lines and plot development techniques that could have been employed here. Instead it was a straight forward and unfortunately, generic version of Ironman. I had thought that with all the complaining Marvel did when the big studio's did, Spiderman(s), Daredevil, Ghostrider, The Fantastic 4(s), The Punisher and X-Men that they themselves would have learned that it is not just a movie; these are legends. These stories should be treated like the campfire legends of history. But instead, we got a movie that spent too much time laying the ground work to become the Ironman franchise.<br /><br />In my opinion Jon Favreau did a great job, Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job, and although I didn't agree at first, Jeff Bridges did an excellent job as well. They just had a Ho-Hum script to work with. I would suggest sending the screenplay writers to Pakistan for some more research.<br /><br />Edited on October 11, 08:  At first I was very disappointed with the movie, even regretted purchasing it.  Now I have watched it 2 more times and I have actually enjoyed it more each time.  The Blue Ray 2nd disc is really interesting with an entire breakdown of the process from set location to casting, all the way to title graphics and sound editing.

4028489,B001I1NGHY, A14JBVLB1ACDVO,2.0, This was it? Really?,"I never jumped on the Ironman bandwagon because I wasn't blown away by the trailers and I'm skeptical of superhero movies. But over time after reviews by critics and moviegoers I actually watched this movie last night.<br /><br />I have to say I was extremely disappointed. The opening scene where Tony Stark riding in a hummer with GI's through Afghanistan was laughable in my eyes. First off it opens up with some guitar music...and I immediately thought ""oh great... ok it's that kind of movie!"" but i stuck with it. People say RDJ character is witty? Seriously? I thought his wittiness was amateur, expected, uncreative and cliche from a half ass writer and a director who should go back to doing cameos in Vince Vaughn and Jeremy Piven movies.<br /><br />Then there's the scene where a hot journalist interviews Tony Stark before jumping into a limo. He gives some arrogant cliche line about maybe stop making weapons and making baby cribs and bottles. then all of the sudden they're naked rolling around in bed. Seriously, wtf? His helper (don't recall catching his name) in the cave in Afghanistan was also laughable. His presence only provided the watcher a gimmick into the idea that Tony Stark is softer then he appears without actually developing Tony Stark character. I laughed out loud when his helper was found dying at the opening of the cave. He whispers and mumbles things in his dying breath to Stark that Stark will take with him forever...but the watcher will never remember that guy who made Stark change because as i said...it's just a gimmick to cover up for bad character creation and writing.<br /><br />The relationship between Stark and Pepper Potts was predictable before they even spoke, and seemed to use every cliche in the book.<br /><br />Ironicly the best acting in my opinion in this overrated Fantastic Four in a Ironman suite of a movie was Jeff Bridges. I honestly thought the best part of the movie was when RDJ and Bridges spoke in front of the giant ARC reactor discussing Stark's decision to go away from making weapons. Bridges in that moment seemed like he could be inserted into any scene in Mad Men.<br /><br />One of the best tips I've read from writers like Harlan Ellison is that you have to leave cliffhangers, keep the audience or reader guessing to which direction a story will go. That leaves them immersed and feeling like they are apart of it. At no point in this movie did I ever think to myself ""damn, i wonder what that's about"", ever feeling I was unsure on what side of the fence a character stood, or feeling slightly sympathetic to a villain like I did with the Joker in The Dark Knight. I felt I knew exactly what was going to happen throughout the entire movie.",Iron Man

I was so bored and confused by this train wreck, I lost interest after 45 minutes of nothing. Robert Downey Jr. is horrible, he brings nothing exciting as Iron Man, highly over-rated actor. I give this film two stars thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard, wish they were in it more, they are the real deal. This is one action film I won't be seeing twice, yuck!",Iron Man
4028495,B001I1NGHY, A75MSQQ3LN86Z,2.0," DON'T BUY IT, RENT IT!","This IRON TURKEY isn't a flick you're likely to want to view twice.  Oh, it may well be a reasoable or even a competent recreation of a Marvel Comic strip Superhero, I don't know because prior to the film's publicity I was unfamiliar with the Superhero.  But, the publicity campaign was effective and the effort was touted as having been produced with a high level of artistic skill and vision.  Nevertheless, five or ten minutes of viewing time, showed the effort to be considerably below the level of other recent films in the Cape/Action/Superhero genre.  It was patently inferior to HELLBOY, for example, on every level.  Or the latest BATMAN.<br /><br />What's it about?  Not much.  The first fifteen minutes of the film is so dark and the sound is so confused and muddy, one sits stymied, wondering what comes next.  All this takes place somwhere in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area.  An American arms manufacturer is captured by terrorists of some sort, who live in caves.  (All very well played and costumed, by the way; most effective.)  They want this man, Tony Stark of Stark Munitions, to make a ""guided"" missle for them.  Tony has been seriously wounded and now wears a sort of big flashlight diode aray where his sternum ought to be.  (Idiotic justification.)  Aided by a doomed multi-lingual individual of uncertain origin -- who is somewhat interesting in spite of the far-fetched and murky dialogue -- Stark builds a self-powered, napalm-spurting flying suit of armor, and escapes the cave.  He crashes in the desert and is promptly picke up by American copters.  Next, he has a one-line epiphany on his way home, which he announces at an impromptu news conference.  He intends to lead Stark Enterprises ""out of the munitions business.""  Into what, everyone wants to know?  ""I don't know yet,"" he replies.<br /><br />Now here we have to pay close attention to Jeff Bridges as he proceeds to fold the movie up, stick it in his breast pocket and walk away with it.  He's absolutely terrific; the best thing in the movie, by far, playing the role Kris Kristoffersen aced often, and last for Wesley Snipes; that of the substitute father-figure.  Here he's Big Daddy Warbucks with a shaved head and white beard, sporting good suits and an enormous cigar.  A baddie too, for all the difference it makes.  But so good and so likeable you yearn to see him from scene to scene until, at the very end, he re-appears driving and 'wearing' a super-flying enhanced armored suit to battle the smaller Tony character in his smaller suit: its like the mano-a-mano last scene in ROBOCOP as the good Humanist Robo battles the bad Corporate Robo.  Not better, just similar.<br /><br />Second best?  Gwenneth Paltrow with a discreetly padded chest, sporting an orange wig and the highest possible stilettoes.  She has nothing to work with, character-wise or script-wise, but manages to create the impression that she endures labial seizures every time her co-star comes near to her.  Its a feat of acting ability and almost comic, because Downey never does anything that even remotely suggests any degree of physical intimacy.  Endlessly condescending, he ignores her and talks over her constantly.  Cold and narcissistic, he touches her once when they briefly dance together for a few seconds.  Prior to this, she does what Lois Stewart did as Miss Moneypenny in the JAMES BOND Series, rolling her eyes and appearing to ooze as Bond passes by.<br /><br />BACK TO THE PLOT.  What's Tony up to?  After his vapid revelation?  He's at work in the billionairei's workshop - garage under his huge  billionaire's hilltop Malibu cottage, re-fashioning a better version of the iron suit he made whilst among the brigands.  Very flashy toys on display.  Virtual this and that.  Flashy cars.  Flashy welding and tooling equipment.  Super electronics to handle his secret Power ""Source.""  Tedium.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Daddy Warbucks reveals himself as working to take over STARK ENTERPRISES for himself.  Purpose?  To sell the newest munitions to the insurgents in the hills.  Tony  finds out and flies -- that's right, flies to Afghanistan -- and Flying ROBOCOP blasts the baddies himself by means of the diodes in his palms and on the soles of his feet.  He is attacked by jet planes, but escapes.  And then, finally, he meets his nemesis at Stark Labs Headquarters and they fight it out.<br /><br />Well, if you enjoy this genre of action movies -- capes and gadgets and super-powers -- you accept the improbabilites that go along with the fantasies.  And,  you have your roster of favorite stars, and you might have wondered  how it came about that Robert downey Jr got cast in the role?  Especially when there's Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Vin Diesel or Wesley Snipes.  And that's just the Americans.  Unless you figure they'd be an ethnic stretch for the story.  But then there's Christian Bale, Patrick Swayze, Orlando Bloom or even Mat Damon and Ben Afflek.  And from the set-up, one wonders if IRON MAN might not have been intended for Afflek or Damon?  La Paltrow is a personal friend of both men and has appeared with them both in various films.  Afflek did well in DAREDEVIL, which did well at the Box Office.  Did he tire of the tights and pulleys and wires?  Or did Damon commit, and then refuse at the last minute, or after reading the script?  Leaving...  Gweneth, and crew.  Money talks, or in this case, it keeps mum.<br /><br />The project is odd, yet conventional, without being entertaining in an unconventional way.  It gave off the feeling of having been stitched together out of whole pieces of comic book and monster movie cliches.  Downey doing his red carpet celebrity walk through the crowds while not speaking to anybody directly -- which he did so perfectly in SOAP DISH, one of the best Show-Biz comedies of the 80s -- in imitation of Bruce Wayne' many entries and exits in all of the latest BATMAN flicks.  But why Downey, particularly?<br /><br />And what about DOWNEY anyway?  Well, since his publicized recouperation, it is obvious that the course of treatment involved an intense regimen of body-building, for the actor has managed to become an obvious Gym-Rat, and Gym-Rats have something in common with Downs syndrome people.  As Downs sufferers share a round-faced, slant-eyed asian appearance, so Gym-Rats share a gaunt, sunken-cheeked volpine resemblence that makes them look like brothers.  Astonishingly, Downey with his pitch black hair, thick browns and inky moustache and goatee, has become the identical twin of venerable Gay porn performer and total Gym Rat, Jason Probe aka Joshua Perez.  Well, let me put it to you this way:  Downey is rather a small, compact man.  Everybody in the entire movie is bigger than he is, and some tower over him.  This is a very odd handicap for a Superhero.  Which makes me wonder why anybody would cast this movie in that way?  What is the point?  The Mighty Mouse effect.  It trivializes everything the hero does.  And if Mr. Downey's height wasn't a consideration in the casting of this movie, why would any producer hire the same casting people to do another job?<br /><br />This is a re-hash of the old BULLETMAN strip.  But, as I say.  Look at it once and return it the next day.  It's good for a bag of popcorn.",Iron Man

So I finally get to see it...and it seemed like 2 hours before he finally got the damn suit on.  Pretty slow build-up there.  Also the ""villain"" was...nobody.<br /><br />Good news is Robert Downey Jr. was FANTASTIC as a playboy, pompous businessman, monkeying around with the suit, sitting eating a burger during the ""change of heart"" press conference etc.  The tension between him as Bond and Paltrow's MoneyPenny (or whatever the hell her name is) was believable too.<br /><br />But once it gets building up to the climax...I really stopped caring.  Particularly when the final battle ends of being a blatant, BLATANT rip-off of the final battle in RoboCop 2.  If you didn't see that one, what happens is little RoboCop ends up fighting a much larger Robot with a gatling gun on his right arm...and later ends up on his back, piggy-back style, destroying it.<br /><br />Sound familiar?<br /><br />Christ people...would it kill you to write something original?<br /><br />So I recommend RoboCop 2 (and the orignal of course).

4028502,B001I1NGHY, A2XR9XYOJSGBV8,5.0," Flashy and self-indulgent, but relentlessly entertaining as well","I'll be the first to admit here that I'm really not a comics buff.<br /><br />I buy comics occasionally and sometimes, I like them. But the comics I buy are far more likely to be, say, the newest trade paperback of Knights of the Old Republic than a Spider-Man comic. In fact, I've never bought a typical superhero comic book, though I've read a few. In part that's because I'm obsessive over continuity and I couldn't force myself to read every Spider-Man, X-Men, or Batman comic in existence. So when I read superhero comics I tend to lean towards new continuities, such as Ultimate Marvel.<br /><br />So I like superhero movies. When they're good. I thought the first Hulk film was embarassingly awful, in spite of having an excellent director and cast. I was passionately disappointed with both the third Spider-Man and X-Men films and I, to this day, still don't understand what's so good about the new Superman movie (but then again I always thought that character was silly). So given all the disappointments I wasn't sure what to expect of the new Iron Man film. On the one hand, the previews looked good, the ratings from critics were astounding (the best rated film this year!), and people had told me it was good. So I had high expectations. But a tiny, little voice inside of me kept telling me that I was setting up for a disappointment, to remember last few year's superhero movies, and that the hype never is lived up to.<br /><br />Fortunately, that little voice was wrong - this time.<br /><br />Surprisingly, given the fact that the script wasn't finished at the time of filming, the story is one of Iron Man's strongest points.<br /><br />The story of Tony Stark's transformation from billionaire to superhero is handled alot better than many origin stories, which often come off as what they are - preludes, prologues, promises for a bigger story. It was the problem with the first Spider-Man film and it was even worse for the first X-Men. But Iron Man, like Batman Begins delivers a story that both promises more (particularly in the last scenes of both) but at the same time delivers a fun and complete story in of itself. Maybe it has something to do with superheroes that don't have superpowers. Or maybe it's because the folks at both Marvel and DC are beginning to realize they need to reinvent the superhero movie into something more in order to retain audience interest after so many.<br /><br />And like the best of the Marvel films it doesn't rely on knowledge of the old superhero comics on which it is based, drawing from both the old continuity and the new Ultimate Marvel stuff. Which is probably the best way to go through with it, since a lot of fans have nostalgia for the old comics but whereas Ultimate Marvel is more befitting for our current time.<br /><br />Tony Stark, of course, steals the show and not least because of the acting behind him. But he also stands on his own as a wry, egotistical, and intelligent superhero who stands out from just about every other superhero. There's not really, as far as I can tell, another guy like him in either the Marvel or DC universes. There's of course the paladin-esque superheroes like Spider-Man or Superman and there's the anti-heroes like Wolverine or Batman (at his best, so long as he doesn't delve into Miller-machismo). But there's not really another superhero who both plays the Lawful Good card and can act like a scoundrel at the same time. It's a nice juggling act and done well here.<br /><br />The transformation of Stark into... a weapons-hater is a little less convincing. This is derived, from what I understand, was a major shift in Marvel's approach to the Vietnam War back in the 1970s, when their readers made it clear they opposed the war (which Iron Man had previously been supporting). So they made Stark into a pseudo-pacifist, which really doesn't work. Thankfully they figure that out and moved on, turning him once again into a super-soldier, though one with a strong set of moral boundaries. I have a feeling, given how Iron Man acts in the film, that this is sort of where Stark is going in the films as well. A good thing too as the whole concept of a superhero walking around in a combat exoskeleton who believes weapons are by default evil and should be destroyed is hardly believable.<br /><br />That said, he doesn't lose his touch once he makes the transformation.<br /><br />As for the supporting characters one of the more interesting is Obadiah Stane, who I'd thought was an original character but who I later learned is from the comics. Although near the end of the film his character declines into cliches throughout about 80% of the film he's as engaging as Stark himself. He fills that borderline between comfort and discomfort, of a character you can't quite really decide on who he is or what he stands for. He's elusive. And that's how it's meant to be and that's how it should be. On the other hand, James Rhodes is less interesting as a character though he still manages to make himself endearing. More or less he's the military man stuck with a guy (Stark, of course) who he likes but can't help but realize is a total pain in the ass. Similarly, Stark's Girl Friday ""Pepper Potts"" (how I wish I was making that name up) is thoroughly and irredeemably boring. Why is it that superhero girlfriends have always got to be absolutely unmissable?<br /><br />The special effects in Iron Man are pretty good - though they're not the best I've seen, either in film *or* in television (they're roughly Battlestar-like in quality). As good as the effects are though, they're not the star of the film's production values. That's the cast. Indeed, there are a large number of big-name actors in this film - the biggest name being the aforementioned Gwyneth Paltrow though oddly she's the least interesting of the cast. But, Robert Downey Jr. (as the titular Iron Man / Tony Stark) and Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane) are the true stars of this film and fill out their roles wonderfully, bringing wit and life to the characters they play.<br /><br />Downey is likely the best casting choice for a superhero lead since Christian Bale and, as OSC put it, ""we never get a sense that the actor is playing his part with tongue in cheek; instead, Downey is playing a character who lives his life with tongue in cheek."" And Downey does this wonderfully. Likewise, Bridges is excellent.<br /><br />Overall, Iron Man is a brilliant superhero film that, alongside The Dark Knight, has helped to reinvigorate the genre.",Iron Man
4028503,B001I1NGHY, A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,5.0, Love Iron Man? You'll Love This Movie. Never Heard of Iron Man? You'll Love This Movie.,"I really liked this film. It's the best Marvel Comics movie yet. As a long time comic book fan, I find this movie fascinating for how it combines elements of the original comics with new takes on the character, all to perfectly capture his essence.<br /><br />Iron Man first appeared in 1963. Stan Lee who created the character and wrote his early adventures makes no secret of the fact that Tony Stark was originally based on Howard Hughes. I'm not talking the later, paranoid, mentally unhinged, obsessively germophobic, hasn't-trimmed-his-fingernails-or-taken-bath-in-five years Howard Hughes, I'm talking the young, amazingly good looking, high-level genius, kinda-looks-ike-Errol-Flynn-and-bonks-any-gorgeous-Hollywood-starlet-he-wants-to Howard Hughes.<br /><br />The early parts of the movie pretty much follow the 1963 origin. While in a foreign country supporting the American war effort (in 1963 it was Vietnam and doing a field review of Stark-designed weapons' performance, in 2008 it's updated to the War on Terror and hawking the Jericho missile system), Tony Stark is severely wounded in an explosion, a piece of shrapnel lodged near his heart that will in weeks work itself inward and kill him. Imprisoned with Professor Yinsen (originally Vietnamese, natch, in the movie not) they work together to free themselves from the evil warlord who has imprisoned them both. Tony builds an armored chest plate that will keep the shrapnel from piercing his heart, and around that he and Yinsen design and build a crude suit of armor, somewhat paradoxically inset with all the cutting edge technological weaponry that a high-level genius intellect, feverishly battling for freedom and against death, can invent when pushed to the edge under incredible time pressure. Tony uses the first, bulky, prototype Iron Man armor to escape but Yinsen dies in the attempt.<br /><br />Stan Lee always felt that every good hero, no matter how powerful, should have a counterbalancing weakness. In Tony's case it's the damage to his heart, and the irony (pun intended) that the Iron Man armor (or at least the chest plate of same) is not just there to be his superheroic identity, it's a necessity to keep him alive. Tony can never take off the chest plate, he has to wear it constantly, hidden under his clothes when not Iron Man, openly when he is. Eventually this goes away when Tony's damaged heart is removed and replaced with a cybernetic heart of his own design. Overtones of the Wizard of Oz's Tin Man without a heart do occur to me.<br /><br />But...I get ahead of myself. Back to the early comic books, and the movie's storyline.<br /><br />When Tony returns to the world, in short order, having seen and felt the ravages of war up-close and personal, he terminates Stark Industries' production of war materiel. Up til this point, the movie is pretty much a well-produced updating of the original story.<br /><br />The rest of the movie skips ahead and pillages ideas from Iron Man stories of decades later, specifically Iron Man's conflict with Obadiah Stane who starts out as Stark's business rival and eventually dons a set of armor called Iron Monger to become Tony's armored antagonist. (Iron Man is always at his best when he's battling high-tech armored villains with suits to pit against his own.) In the movie Stane is recast as Tony's business partner and paternal figure after his own father's death.<br /><br />We do skip in the movie the iterations of Iron Man armor between the first gray suit and the most current versions which are visually based on Japanese samurai armor, very techno-geek manga-esque. In particular we skip the sleek design that Stark wore longer than any other suit, and for me has always been THE classic Iron Man.<br /><br />Pepper Potts was an early cast member who then disappeared for decades before eventually being reintegrated into the Iron Man mythos. James Rhodes (Rhodey), though retconned as one of Stark's oldest friends, was actually a much later addition to the series, not first appearing until the late 1970s. They both work well as supporting characters in the movie. The robot Jarvis, for those who aren't comic book fans and thus don't get the little in-joke, is a play on the long running character of the Avengers' butler, Englishman Edwin Jarvis.<br /><br />The linchpin of the film is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark. When I first heard of his casting, it was from a guy bitching about what a BAD idea he thought it was. ""Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, that's just ridiculous."" I said slowly as I thought about it, ""Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark....that's just F--KING BRILLIANT. Perfect casting."" And it was. Downey Jr. can play an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high-IQ addict (I've heard it said we'll get into Tony's alcoholism in the second film) because he is in fact an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high-IQ addict. It's tempting to say that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play this role.",Iron Man
4028504,B001I1NGHY, A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,5.0, Birth of new film franchise never misses a step - fantastic adaptation,"Forgive me for not being familiar with the comic book ""Ironman"" - I've only put a toe in the graphic novel pool and I've flat-out missed this one.<br /><br />So perhaps my rave review of this comic book adaptation is somewhat uninformed.  But given the fact that the filmmakers went for a PG-13 blockbuster approach, it's hard to imagine how director Jon Favreau (no, not President Obama's speechwriter, but the guy from ""Swingers"" and ""Elf"") could have given us a more polished, pitch-perfect movie.<br /><br />Start with a clever and detailed ""birth of Ironman"" story, a pretty funny script, and a wonderful ensemble of top-notch actors, and you've got a great cocktail.  As has been widely commented, the movie starts and stops with Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar performance as genius weapon-designer Tony Stark.  Poking gentle fun at Downey's sordid past, ""Ironman"" provides a fresh perspective on the superhero - Stark is one cool dude.<br /><br />Surrounding him are Gwyneth Paltrow as secretary/love interest Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as sidekick and straight man Rhodey, and Jeff Bridges as the bombastic Obadiah Stane (the name should give you some clues).  These gifted actors breathe life into characters that not only shine in the big scenes but also in the quiet, more mundane moments in the movie.<br /><br />I won't bother recapping the plot - it's pretty by-the-numbers fare - but strongly recommend enjoying this movie for its attention to detail.  Virtually every scene has something to recommend it, which isn't always the case with comic book adaptations because there's often so much darn exposition and backstory.  The first half of the movie shows the birth of Ironman in perhaps the most entertaining form of all - a birth of necessity.  You're so captivated by the character of Stark that you find yourself ignoring the top-notch special effects and how the movie - for all its violence - stays safely on the PG side without descending into ""Phantom Menace"" cartoonishness.<br /><br />An excellent film that has given birth to a new franchising juggernaut (""Ironman 2"" and ""Ironman 3"" are already in pre-production), ""Ironman"" is a guilt pleasure without the guilt.",Iron Man

The plot though thin, rang true and the superhero is expected to do some real acting. Though his feats are amazing, it is the scenery, his soul and the people supporting him that make this film so good.<br /><br /> Robert Downey, Jr plays Ray Stark, he owns a company that makes and sells high tech weaponry. At the moment he is in Afghanistan showing off his weaponry, when his group is attacked. He spends the next three months  building a suit to protect his new heart and himself. In the process he escapes and comes back to to life in California. Iron Man has a great cast of characters- Terrence Howard, as the military man, Gwyneth Paltrow as his girl Friday and Jeff Bridges as his accomplice in the company- Bridges really wears black. Needless  to say the plot thickens and Iron Man goes on to build a new suit to defend his newly found ethical behavior and save the day.<br /><br />Save the day, he does- Robert Downy Jr is a first rate actor with emotional liability and he is the Iron Man. The other actors are also first rate and this is the film of the past year, IMO.<br /><br />There is a shocking revelation and the hardware is impressive. This is a fun film for all.  The computer aided visuals are impressive and Iron Man, well he has Soul!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-02-09<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DE29SS"">Chaplin (15th Anniversary Edition)</a>",Iron Man
4028507,B001I1NGHY, AATGQ3OAC6XOA,2.0, SOMETHING VERY GAY ABOUT THIS FLICK!!,"Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark character was not hard enough for me and when you are a Superhero, you have to be extra hard in and out of costume!! I didn't like how every opportunity he got to turn down a kiss and sex he did so like he was fully aware of his homosexual following was watching and chose not to disappoint them. The scene where he is with his contraption looked just like he was caught ""gettin off"". As for the movie itself it was just ok and not spectacular like it should have been(like 300!). He had no true evil adversary to boost his skill level alot more so all we are left with is admiring his suit which was very cool. Marvel is so trippin' not basing alot of their stories straight out of their comic book pages and it is hurting their attempts to showcase these easy ones and they are not hitting the mark. Big budget advertising and the good box office receipts still don't impress me as I am very well versed on all these characters and see the holes very well. I would for one like it if they start making them R-rated instead of the safe PG(There are enuff kids movies already!!) which forces them to take more chances and be more creative in the action and plots. I saw more drama in Todd Mcfarlanes animated Spawn series on HBO than these movies Marvel has been producing! While it is good that they are coming out more frequently than before, they need to focus more on making these huge budget hero movies for adults where the kids can come with the parents and be braced for a cool and wild ride again like the blockbuster ""300"". The audience for it is definitely there and so is the big box office they want as long as the story , action and plot stays in tact. And finally, let the fellas ""get some"" please?!!  Better than the new Hulk but not that much. I rate it a C.  Thanks Again Ya'll!!",Iron Man
4028508,B001I1NGHY, AMPTUVYLEH4T8,2.0, Marvelous? Weak Script,"Hype can work against anything that is mediocre.  If it doesn't live up to the hype, it becomes a bigger disappointment than would have without the hype. This movie, Ironman, was just an ordinary action movie. Personally, there are too may holes in the plot to live up to Stan Lee's reputation.  When you are expecting the detail and original ideas generated in comics or graphic novels you know that plot lines and details really matter.  This movie didn't live up to that scrutiny.<br /><br />As Marvel's first major production movie it was just OK.  Again, I was expecting to be told a story of Tony Stark, Stark Enterprises, Obediah, Pepper and war, that's what I got.  However, with the wealth of truly original story lines and material generated over 30 years of Ironman I expected the story to move and excite me.  It didn't.<br /><br />There are many different time lines and plot development techniques that could have been employed here.  Instead it was a straight forward and unfortunately, generic version of Ironman.  I had thought that with all the complaining Marvel did when the big studio's did, Spiderman(s), Daredevil, Ghostrider, The Fantastic 4(s) and X-Men that they themselves would have learned that it is not just a movie; these are legends.  These stories should be treated like the campfire legends of history. But instead, we just got a movie.<br /><br />In my opinion Jon Favreau did a good job, Robert Downey did an excellent job and although I didn't agree at first, Jeff Bridges did an excellent job as well.  They just had a Ho-Hum script to work with.  I would suggest sending the screenplay writers to Pakistan for some more research.<br /><br />Personally, I wish I would have rented this one rather than buying it.",Iron Man

If you're going to put someone in a metal suit and send them zipping through the sky, you can do much more than was done in this film. It screamed ""computer generated,"" which was a shame. I could have done much better with an empty Iron Man suit, a helicopter, some cables and some clouds. When is Hollywood going to realize we don't need to see protracted shots of Iron Man flying? Put a camera in an airplane or helicopter, shoot at a high framerame and get as close to the ocean or land as you can get and go.<br /><br />I never thought, with technology being as good as it is today, that I'd be sitting back in a theater seat and thinking, ""Fake!

How else to explain it's 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes?  Packed with airheaded one liners masquerading as meaningful dialogue, and one dimensional characters so narcissistically unlikable a Wal-Mart greeter wouldn't even acknowledge their presence, this clunker somehow goes through all the motions of a summertime action movie without being the least bit entertaining.  Oh and it has a deep moral message too: making weapons for a living is evil, because someday bad guys might use them!",Iron Man
4028518,B001I1NGHY, A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,1.0, Robocop flies to Afghanistan!,"This is basically 'Robocop' updated to 2008. Except it's nowhere as good as that film. The '87 thriller is set in the future with an equally implausible scenario, but far more intruiging: the body of a murdered police officer is used to create a robot who still retains traces of the dead man's memories. The core of Iron Man is plain silly: set in the present time, the iron man (played by Robert Downey Jr.) must prance around with some kind of magnet implanted in his chest cavity, preventing shrapnel from puncturing his heart. Then, he invents an iron suit which enables him to fly at supersonic speeds and kill terrorists without suffering serious injury. Like Robocop, a computer interface is suggested inside the 'mask' of both superheroes; but in Robocop the hero is haunted by the memories of the dead man whose body was used to create him.<br /><br />There is no such internal tension in Iron Man. It's strictly a good guy-bad guy shoot 'em up. Downey plays Stark, the head of a large corporation which manufactures weapons. Stark is depicted as an arrogant playboy who takes no precautions when he travels around in a Humvee in Afghanistan. He ends up being captured by a local warlord and his crew of motley insurgents and realizes that they have been using his company's weapons to fight US troops. Now he suddenly has a change of heart and uses his skills (he's a genius!) to create an iron man outfit to escape the bad guys (they think he's working on a missile).<br /><br />When he returns to the US, he decides to utilize the prototype of the iron man outfit he created in Afghanistan to become a superhero fighting for good. A good part of the film is taken up with Downey designing the new Iron Man outfit; during the 'testing phase' he gets thrown against the walls of his laboratory numerous times (how exciting!). Finally, he starts flying through the air with this metal suit on and almost crashes when he goes too high up in the atmosphere and his suit gets frozen with ice (funny how he wasn't smart enough to invent some kind of deicing device contained on most commercial aircrafts).<br /><br />Terrence Howard (of 'Hustle & Flow' fame) isn't doing much hustling and flowing here in a do-nothing part as an army liaison officer for the munitions company. Similarly Gwyneth Paltrow, Stark's personal assistant, engages in a great deal of pointless banter leading to a non-romantic moment at the film's denouement. Jeff Bridges probably has the best part as Downey's partner in the multinational corporation who ends up betraying him and working with the warlords and terrorists in Afghanistan. But how did he so easily get past the alarm system or other security devices in Downey's home? You would think that breaking into a home like that wouldn't be so easy.<br /><br />In the end, there is the obligatory battle between the two machines (done much better in Teriminator 2). Bridges looks ridiculous when he takes off his metal helmet and all you see is his face inside the metal contraption. I fail to see why so many critics gave this film good marks. It's strictly a film for uneducated teenagers who read comic books all day. It also serves to lull people in this country into a false sense of security vis-a-vis the terrorist threat. By creating an invincible 'Iron Man"" who can easily mow down terrorists and bad guys, it makes us forget that the bad guys in real life are not so easily defeated. Case in point: 9/11. The only winners here are the actors who collected nice paychecks for participating in such a cheesy and worthless venture.",Iron Man

No, it wasn't an explosive missile from his arch-nemesis in the film, Iron Monger played by Jeff Bridges. Instead it was something that could have been devastating for the film's Blu-ray release and possibly delivered a spot of damage to the Blu-ray format overall.<br /><br />It seems retailers carrying Iron Man on Blu-ray, set for release on Sept. 30, are enduring an eleventh hour recall from Paramount. Considering Iron Man was one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer, the splashy special effects film is perfect for Blu-ray's high definition picture quality and Dolby True HD 5.1 lossless audio. It could have been a real set-back for the format itself at this critical juncture as Iron Man could be one of Blu-ray's break-out titles.<br /><br />Due to an apparent authoring problem with the disc Paramount has recalled the Blu-ray version of Iron Man from retailers. Rumor has it the problem was with disc 1 playing back in certain Sony Blu-ray players.<br /><br />The studio received reports of compatibility issues with review copies that had been sent out weeks ago. Distributors have only recently been told to send back all copies of the disc. As a result Paramount has stated that it may have to delay the title's release date to October 7.<br /><br />While a one week delay for the Blu-ray release date may not seem like much, especially after the Godfather Trilogy's release this week - which should keep many BD fans busy, if Paramount decides to go ahead with the DVD release on schedule it will almost certainly hurt Blu-ray sales.<br /><br />But according to some sources, the word from Paramount is that the studio is working around the clock and determined to meet the official release date of Sept. 30. Some have even reported that they've already received a fixed copy of the Iron Man Blu-ray disc so it looks like old ShellHead might have dodged a damaging projectile that wasn't in the script.""<br /><br />Amazon did an Excellent job in sending out a replacement disk - BUT -<br />I now fear that any replacement will also have this Issue...<br />(5 Star Support - Thanks Amazon)<br /><br />USE CAUTION WHEN YOU BUY THIS MOVIE ON BLU-RAY!<br /><br />FYI: I am using a PS3 80GB as my player and online update confirms I have the latest firmware!<br /><br />Buyer-Be-Ware.",Iron Man

While Robert Downy Jr's acting and spontaneous ability for dialogue and wit never fail to please, the story, for me, fell very short.  If this film is, indeed, based on the original comic book story of Iron Man, then the story failed to impress me.  In this film, it seems you spend more time watching the endless, ongoing process of how his superhero suit is created step-by-step rather than the action and the danger that you crave.

A superhero action movie done by-the-book. Main character (a weapons merchant/manufacturer) is caught and held hostage by generic bad guys, terrorists or just warmongers, it's not explained. What the viewer has to know is that they are bad to the bone. Their leader has plans for world domination. The hero secretly builds a powered suit of steel armor and escapes. In captivity he undergoes some sort of change of mind and doesn't want to make weapons anymore.<br /><br />The conflicts in this movie are very simple and show opposing sides playing the game of escalation in which the former weapon merchant and genius inventor clearly wins.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin) is expectedly very good, although I have a feeling he didn't have to strain himself very much playing the cartoonish Tony Stark/Ironman. He definitely makes the best from what he gets. Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love) is WASTED in a subplot which leads nowhere. At least her character (excuse my forgetting her name) gets lots of money from the Stark's company. Jeff Bridges (Big Lebowski) (another actor wasted) plays the company co-owner and, by the end of the movie, a giant evil robot, a villain whose motivation is money. There is also the general (another wasted actor, sorry for not remembering the name) who is only there to show that Stark has a friend and to prevent IM being shot down by american forces.<br /><br />There was not a shred of good dialogue in the movie, except for several Stark one-liners included for laughs (some of them actually funny `tho). Special effects are cool and are the best part of the movie and prevent it from being a complete disaster. Ending is incredibly weak. The first 1/3 (or so) lets you expect something that doesn't come later. Stark escapes and from there the intelligence of the movie goes downhill.<br />All in all this is a good summer entertainment but nothing to ponder about after watching.",Iron Man

But when Tony Stark makes his escape from the terrorists it begins to go downhill.  Sure it had it's funny moments as Stark builds his second Iron Man suit as well as one good action sequence once the suit was completed.  Jeff Bridges, Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow were completely wasted.  Terrence Howard's character could have been written out of the script without affecting what little story this movie had.

4028546,B001I1NGHY, A2OP1HD9RGX5OW,2.0, One of the most racist movies I've ever seen.,"The special effects were excellent.  There were moments of comedy, and the plot was decent.  I particularly appreciated the attempt to support nonviolent action.  The acting by Jeff Bridges, Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, and Gwyneth Paltrow was amazing- though some credit needs to go to the make-up job as well.  I was racking my brain, for I knew I'd seen these actors before, but they did such a good job of embracing new characters, of becoming characters, that I lost sight of the actors themselves.  This had the makings of a great movie, for its genre.<br /><br />There are some glitches, however.  Repeatedly people go into Stark's chest cavity without a sterile environment- when everyone knows this is just a recipe for infection and disease.  There are difficulties with how fast the villain learns how to use the weapons.  But of greatest difficulty is the dating of the material.<br /><br />Honestly.  We are in the 21st century.  Do we still need caricatures of people groups appearing as incompetent buffoons and inherently evil?  This film reads as if the director took his cues from Shaheen's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1566563887"">Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People</a>.  Nearly every classic point of Arab stereotyping in Hollywood is followed by this movie.  A full third of the runtime is spent with the evil Muslims and Arabs, yelling in Arabic and killing people and thirsting for more weapons.  All of this takes place in Afghanistan, but there seem to be few Afghanis around.  It's a multinational terrorist force, run mostly by Arabs, and in Arabic.<br /><br />Sure, it's only a comic book movie. I'm not expecting the in-depth real-life drama of the Afghani <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OX7EO"">The Kite Runner</a>.  But comics and the movies- indeed all of popular culture- have the ability to greatly influence us.  This after all is the goal of anyone who creates a quality movie.  Indeed, this has often been the maxim of The Great One - Stan Lee (who incidentally has his best cameo ever in this film).  Stan Lee often speaks of how much comics can influence culture, that they should not be viewed merely as comics.  He often very purposely puts his crusade for justice into the midst of his characters and stories. Sadly, some don't take the words of the author seriously- that his stories matter, that justice matters.<br /><br />There is of course the courtesy good Arab guy who initially helps Stark out, but we barely know he's Arabic.  He looks less swarthy, he's a polyglot, and rarely speaks Arabic.  In mannerisms and culture he acts like a typical American- letting us know that Arabs are alright as long as they are so much like us that we don't have to realize that they are Arabic.<br /><br />As my stomach turned, I kept hoping that the movie would somehow redeem its initial treatment of Arabs, perhaps showing us in some way how the Arabs in the movie came to desire weapons, because their homes were trashed by the Americans and Stark was selling weapons everywhere.  Evidently no redemption was possible.  With one exception, the only people Iron Man kills are Arabs, but there are thrilling moments of him going out of his way to rescue Americans who were attacking him.  (By this point we've obviously lost the hope for the non-violent focus that was initially so promising.)  The coup de grace is the line from the ultimate villain to the head Arab villain, that ""their part of the world"" has never been able to keep up technologically.  It's not just that the Arabs are villains.  They are bad villains.  They can't even do that right.<br /><br />The issue of course is not one movie.  It is rather that, in the thousands of movies that Arabs and Muslims have been shown in in Hollywood history, nearly all of them have been stereotypical or negative portrayals.  (About fifty have been positive.)  And Iron Man has suddenly risen to the top of this infamous list.  There was no need to use Arabs and Muslims in this modern portrayal of the Iron Man myth, for there are plenty of other villains around.  If Arabs were to be the villains, there was no need to show them as stereotypes.  If Arabs and Muslims were to be the villains, the directors could have taken this opportunity to show how they are also humans, and there are reasons that they turn to a life of violence.<br /><br />If you see this movie, consider as you watch it if every single Arab or Muslim in the movie was replaced by a Jew.  It's not so far-fetched.  Movies of the 30s commonly had the stereotypical Jew in the role that Arabs and Muslims now fill all too often today.  But we now realize portraying most minorities as stereotypes and over-the-top villains is wrong.  Thank God we now know this is anti-Semitic, and have rejected such racist portrayals.  Except Arabs are Semites too.<br /><br />This movie had the directing, acting, and writing to have a lot of potential.  As it is, it will show all over the US and confirm American prejudices of Arabs and Muslims.  Then it will show all over the world, and confirm Arab and Muslim beliefs of what we think of them.  And that won't go very far in obtaining peace.",Iron Man
4028547,B001I1NGHY, A3DGVB3T5QJNRE,1.0, Memo to Hollywoo,"I have to admit, I fell for all the hype that this was going to be a enjoyable film. The reason I pay close to$10.00 to watch a film on the big screen is to be entertained, to get some emotional pleasure! One of the problems with Iron Man is that it's geared towards the mind of a child/young teen without any charm. It's so incredibly predictable, a sort of comic-book-story-formula-film. A very clever way for Hollywood to make a quick buck at the expense of an interesting (on some level) story. I'm tired of the meanie terrorist villains. I'm tired of the totally clueless good guy(s). I'm tired of the evil mentor! This story has absolutely zero imagination. It's at the intelligence level of a second-rate, Saturday morning cartoon!<br /><br />It's also about the crudest form of exploitation for financial profit imaginable! The really bad guys have always got to be Arabs, or look like Arabs. They kill innocent civilians for no reason. They hide in caves, like the hated Japanese soldiers did in World War 2. But only a rich and powerful U.S. weapons inventor & dealer can come to the rescue! Wow! What a message that sends to weapon makers of the world! Who would ever of guessed that deep, down, inside, one of the Merchant's of Death literally has a heart of gold (or palladium, in this case)!<br /><br />Afghanistan is currently an extremely troubled country even though it has a very rich cultural tradition. It's a shame it was dumbed down in Iron Man to helpless civilians, brutal warlords, an impotent and clueless U.S. military and one white man who had a very unconvincing conversion experience. If Hollywood is going to bring politics and current events into a comic book story then they need act more like mature adults, instead of soulless moneygrubers trying to make a quick buck off of the horrific suffering of people in some distant land. Afghanistan is not some make believe place! It's a place where real people, including brave Americans, and many others from around the world, are risking their lives everyday!<br /><br />I hope Hollywood stops treating the moviegoers of the world like a bunch of idiots. And, while I'm at it, it would be nice if some of the many millions of dollars Hollywood is going to make from Iron Man is donated to various third-party, non-profit organizations working on reconstructing Afghanistan's civilian infrastructure! They certainly could use the money!<br /><br />For those who think selling weapons is funny see: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047026196X"">Merchant of Death: Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible</a>,  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BYA5GO"">Lord of War (2-Disc Special Edition)</a>,  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009AOBP"">The Ugly American</a> and most importantly: Committing to Afghanistan: the case for increasing U.S. reconstruction and stabilization aid.: An article from: Military Review<br /><br />For a MUCH more entertaining approach to Science Fiction see:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAE"">Zardoz</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAC"">Enemy Mine</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TZN7KQ"">Fantastic Planet</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXP"">A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630587493X"">Bicentennial Man</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S86J0I"">Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)</a>",Iron Man

4028557,B001I1NGHY, A364W6U6YL219D,4.0, A cool exec with a heart of steel?,"Iron Man  (2008) One of Marvel Comics' coolest, if not most famous superheroes finally gets brought to the big screen for the first time in this new flick from director Jon Favreau. Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a brilliant billionaire industrialist and weapons manufacturer carrying on the legacy of his late father in designing bigger and better weapons to protect this great land of ours. He is a hard drinking, womanizing, self centered vanity case, but his charm carries him, along with the piles of money he makes. While on a junket in Afghanistan to show off his newest missile, Stark's convoy is attacked and he is caught by a ruthless Afghani terrorist cabal. The attack left Stark with deadly shrapnel in his chest, threatening his heart, but a fellow scientist prisoner manages to cobble together a nasty looking but effective electromagnetic pacemaker and jam it into Stark's chest to hold the shrapnel at bay. The terrorists want Stark to build them one of his new missiles, but seeing them using his weaponry, devices he created to protect Americans, which there should be no way they could have, Stark has a figurative change of heart to go along with his literal one. He agrees to make the rocket, and makes a list of materials he'll need. When the baddies give him the goods however, he instead cobbles together a clunky but highly effective armored battlesuit he uses to wipe out most of the villains and escape. Back in America, Stark picks up his old life with Air Force pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard), mentor Stane (Jeff Bridges), and especially Girl Friday Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). He does have to deal with wearing a glowing chest ornament the size of a small dinner plate, but no Marvel Comics hero's life is perfect, no matter how much money he has. Stark also takes the battlesuit design further, building a sleeker, faster version that turns him fully into the superhero Iron Man. Now, with all this high tech weaponry at his disposal, he has to find out who has sold him out by selling his weapons design to Afghani terrorists. And, unknown to Stark, that same someone is using the pieces of his first design to reverse engineer an even larger, more deadly battlesuit. Once again, jumping right into line with ""Michael Keaton as Batman"" I wasn't sure an Iron Man movie starring Robert Downey Jr and directed by Jon Favreau would be what I wanted it to be. And once again I couldn't have been more wrong. Downey is totally committed and up to the game, giving Stark a roguish charm that is simply perfect, and he's not afraid to let the identity hiding armor take over when Iron Man shows up. Of course, it doesn't hurt that unlike Spider-Man, director Favreau can cut to close-ups of Downey inside the armor, so we the audience still get to see all the emotions the actor's face can show without having to rip the hero's mask off in every scene. The casting is perfect down the line, with every actor and actress looking exactly like the comics' version, and that extends to the moment after the credits too many people will have missed, a fine bit that promises more fun to come AND ties this film directly to another summer release this year. (Crossover sequel anyone?) Kudos to director Favreau for balancing the action and lighter moments, and providing a lot of flash bang but not letting the movie coast on the effects. (He also takes a prime role for anyone familiar with Iron Man's comics backstory as chauffeur ""Happy"" Hogan, who doesn't get a lot of screen time here, but promises to show up more in the sequel and get some quality time with Paltrow!) All in all a fun flick I highly recommend to those so inclined.",Iron Man

Everything felt right. Robert Downey JR was born to play Tony Stark/Iron Man. Jeff Bridges still plays a bad guy as well as anybody onscreen. Gweneth Paltrow IS Pepper Potts in look and characterization. Marvel hit one out of the ballpark with this movie.<br /><br />The story updates the characters for a more modern look and feel. Instead of Vietnam we are in the middle east. Yet, the update is so true to who the characters are that they never lose track of how things should be. The first Iron-Man armor is crudely built to escape from the bad guys. Tony Stark's motivation for being Iron-Man is stronger than his comic book's version. Here he is fighting to undo the bad (Stark's company selling weapons for war usage) by becoming Iron-Man.<br /><br />Once back home Tony goes through a few Iron Man armors which fits in perfectly with his comic book history. I don't say this with a grain of salt, this is one of the best comic book movies ever! It stays very true to the comics but also adds to the characters. We almost know what's coming but the movie still surprises. It's one of the rare comic book movies that holds up in repeat viewings. I'd put this up with the first two Spidey movies. first two Superman movies, Tim Burton's and the current Batman movies & X-Men 2.

4028560,B001I1NGHY, A23GFTVIETX7DS,5.0, Marvel Comic with Pizzazz (From Blu-Ray Version),"Iron Man seems made for Blu-Ray, although it succeeds in any format.  This witty, human, explosive action film sets a high standard, along with The Dark Knight, for the genre.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark, a playboy, irreverent billionaire who believes, like his father, that whoever had the biggest stick keeps the peace.  His company provides the US government with high tech weapons meant to destroy enemies in enormous numbers, and he sees nothing wrong with it.  However, Tony finds himself at the wrong end of Stark Enterprises and has an epiphany.  Iron Man emerges from this psychological low:  a uniquely powered metal suit with jet packs, flame throwers, and brute strength that houses Stark.  A weapon, yes, but one designed to protect.  Unfortunately, his displaced second, once the CEO of Stark Enterprises, Stane (Jeff Bridges) does not agree with the direction Stark intends to take his company.<br /><br />Downey, Jr. is simply perfect for the role of Tony Stark -- he plays smarmy as well as he does brilliant, intense as well as he does comic, heartless as well as he does lovable. His facial expressions while ""inside"" the Iron Man suit remind us that a human we can empathize with is contained within the seemingly invincible armor.  Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet, if a little ditzy, as romantic interest Pepper Potts, but her performance stands up against Downey Jr's charismatic screen presence, not an easy feat.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning, particularly on Blu-Ray, and the soundtrack is powerful.  The Blu-Ray comes with two discs containing some special features of note:  the creation of the special effects; interviews/commentary, mostly with Stan Lee, of the evolution of the comic book series; and a fun glimpse into Downey Jr's and Bridge's rehearsal of one scene.  Blu-Ray also includes BD Live, if you're into that kind of online chat.

So the filming puts you into a mood the characters and action does not really support.  And speaking of action, this moving is terribly lacking.  The previous potter movies were action packed with all sorts of jokes and interactions.  This movie has some action, then it goes on some long drawn out hiatus.  The characters blink onto some deserted island or forest, and its totally barren.  And they sit there and look at each other for like 5 minutes.  I just can't get into it.  Seems like this is how they stretched two movies out of this.  By putting in all this dead time.<br /><br />Then the tension between the 3 main characters seems forced and strained.

The way this begins with characters that are not really bad, being in league with bad characters is awkward.

I went back to see it three more times! The first half of the book was good but a tad slow, and the filmmakers made sure this wasn't the case for the movie. They created a proper balance of comedy, action, and character development. If you like the Harry Potter series, you will not be disappointed.

4942513,B004WMKSH2, A73QPH7NGI0DJ,5.0, The end is nigh.,"If any popcultural product could be said to have dominated the first decade of the 21st century, it was ""Harry Potter"".  Between 1997 and 2011, the only years that did not see either a new book or film released were 2006 and 2008, and two years (2003 and 2007) had both.  Now, the saga is drawing to a close, with the seventh and final book being split into two films, staggered between the winter of 2010 and the summer of 2011.  At the helm once again is David Yates, who, when all is said and done, will have directed fully half of the films in the series, making his by far the most distinctive directorial imprint (though his borrows quite a bit from Alfonso Cuaron's tenure).  The decision to split the story in two has inspired two different sets of opinion, with some saying it drags things out and other welcoming the extra time.  I fall into the the latter category; the expanded canvas, in my view, allows the story to really breathe in a way that even the best of the preceding films (""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""Order of the Phoenix"") did not.  Spoilers follow.<br /><br />The preceding film ended with the death of Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon), the greatest light wizard in the world.  This is akin to America's nuclear arsenal vanishing midway through the Cold War; any sense of balance of power has vanished, and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is moving quickly to finish the overthrow of the Ministry of Magic and kill Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the only potential threat to him.  Harry and his two closest friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have a quest of their own:  locate and destroy the four remaining Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort, which will render him mortal at last.  They have, unfortunately, very little sense of how to do this, and when Voldemort's forces come after them, they end up on the run, cut off from most of their allies.<br /><br />Indeed, isolation is the key theme of this first half of the story.  The previous films were set mainly around Hogwarts, which pointedly does not appear in this film at all.  Most of the supporting cast put in only brief, though usually memorable, appearances towards the start of the movie, and a few, such Professor McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) are absent entirely.  Yates and screenwriter Steven Kloves actually heighten the sense of isolation compared to the novel, where it was already pronounced - between leaving the Weasley residence and visiting Malfoy Manor, our heroes don't encounter a single friendly wizard, whereas in the book they met a few, and the wizard radio broadcasts have become merely a tally of missing or dead wizards.<br /><br />Thus the weight of the production descends almost entirely on Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, the young actors we've been following for a decade.  By now, these roles fit them like gloves, and they all do the best work of their young careers here.  Watson, who was the highlight of the early films in particular, is amazingly expressive here.  Radcliffe has what is in some ways the blandest role, that of the hero, but he does an excellent job with it.  A frequent fan complaint about previous films was how Ron lost much of his more serious material in favour of comic relief - Rupert Grint finally gets some really meaty dramatic material here (as well as some of his usual good comedy), and shows real skill in his handling of it.  The supporting actors, ranging from other young actors like Evanna Lynch and Matthew Lewis to experienced pros like Helena Bonham Carter, Jason Isaacs, and David Thewlis, all do their usual capable work.  Some, in particular Lewis as Neville, will get their big moments in the second part of the story.  The technical aspects of the production are, as one would expect, flawless.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Assuming Part 2 keeps this level of quality, and I see no reason to think it won't, this will go down as the series' strongest entry.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The movie is by and large quite faithful to the book. This is both good and bad. The good obviously means that a great book is brought to the screen. The bad means that the pacing has to be very fast in order to preserve the structure of the book. This means that anyone not familiar with the book might have quite the task keeping pace as plot developments come at the viewer thick and fast.<br /><br />2. Our three stalwarts, portrayed by Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson, are on their own for much of the film with no supporting cast to help carry the load. They all do a fine job. The Potter series was truly fortunate when these three were cast.<br /><br />3. The film really can't stand on its own nor is it supposed to. It does try to come to a climax of sort and succeeds more or less but no viewer can possibly be satisfied with it. I recommend waiting to watch this until Part 2 is in hand to avoid frustration.<br /><br />Highly recommended. The Potter series has maintained high standards throughout. This film validates the decision to split the final book into two parts.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Harry Potter has been through quite a lot in his past 6 years at Hogwarts, but now it is time to make the full transition from child to adult.<br /><br />For the first time in film history a film based on a single piece of literature has been broken in two in order to bring the entire story safely to film. `Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1' shows us all the steps taken to the final showdown between Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort. With it comes many challenges and hurdles for Harry and his friends to overcome.  This film, while many call it a 3 hour filler is probably the most overlooked of all the films. This part of the story has some of the most incredible acting and character development seen in the past 6 films. With some amazing heartfelt moments that cause a rollercoaster of emotional states. I am quite surprised that this film gets so much flack. Now that I have seen Part 2 and I can firmly state that this section of the final chapter is in fact the better movie. I was more on edge watching this film than the second and maybe that is because I am one that really appreciates acting more than action. Not, that there wasn't good acting in the second part, but you will have to wait for my final Harry Potter film review when ` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is officially released on DVD and Blu Ray.<br /><br />I also keep stating that I have a major beef with Blu Ray. Before Blu Ray was released they managed to give us just as many special features on DVDs and now since Blu Ray at least to me is nothing but a space saver the film industry is literally taking a massive dump on DVDs.

4942528,B004WMKSH2, A2C1GJPAMJAA1N,2.0, Weak - SPOILERS,"Kudos to those of you who haven't read the book and were still able to follow this story! I read Deathly Hallows when it first came out but didn't remember much of it, and the movie did little to refresh my memory.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I rented it online, so there were no subtitles that would have helped me at least follow the fast, oftentimes whispered, mumbled or hissed dialogue. But even with subtitles, I doubt that the story would have been less confusing or more interesting.<br /><br />The flashback scenes (or whatever they were) were so fast and so short that most of them didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />The ""guards"" (or whatever they were) at the Ministry of Magic wore uniforms that were clearly inspired by the SS. Everybody else seemed to be in Muggle clothes. Why was nobody wearing robes? Wouldn't that have been part of Voldemort's cultural purification program?<br /><br />Why were Harry, Hermione and Ron Apparating around the country? What were they trying to accomplish? Did they think they would stumble across a Horcrux in the middle of a forest?<br /><br />What was up with that Bathilda Bagshot character at Godric's Hollow? Did she talk to Harry in Parseltongue? Shouldn't that have raised a red flag? Why was there no discussion between Harry and Hermione after Mrs. Bagshot turned into Nagini?<br /><br />I'm assuming the locket they were trying to destroy was Salazar Slytherin's, but was it ever explained in the movie?<br /><br />Why did Gryffindor's sword appear at the bottom of a lake, of all places? In the middle of winter, at that!<br /><br />What was the deal with the shining doe that led Harry to the sword? Who (or what) was it and where did it come from?<br /><br />Why did the friends not Apparate to safety when they were pursued by the bad guys (no idea who they were) in the forest?<br /><br />On a general note: 99% of the movie took place in poorly lit locations or at night, and I found the perpetual gloom annoying.<br /><br />The online video quality is not very good.

4942530,B004WMKSH2, A1IOO9KVKA330W,5.0, A trip into the disturbing.,"Before getting around to watching this film, I'd heard a lot of mixed things from various friends and online critics. They were saying that the film dragged in places, was filled with pointless parts that amount to nothing, and that if someone hadn't read the books, they'd be completely confused as to what was happening. Most the hardcore Harry Potter fans said it was a great representation of the book. . . so while first sliding the Blu-Ray disc into my Playstation 3, there was a sense of apprehension. 'The Deathly Hallows' as a book, while good, has its problems. What if the film turned out to compound those problems instead of solve them? Many film adaptations have a tendancy toward that.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me before I'd even watched it, was why did they have to split this into two films? They produced a great film adaptation of 'The Order of the Phoenix', and that book is packed with way more content than DH. The popular answer was that WB could milk the cash cow. But come on. . . all the Harry Potter films could have benefited from being split into two parts. At least DH will be covering more area than the others were allowed.<br /><br />Now that I have watched the film, I cannot say that I was ""pleasantly surprised"". . . associating the word ""pleasant"" with DH seems wrong, given how unforgivingly dark this story is. Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is a puppy in comparison (a puppy that bites your ankles, but a puppy nonetheless). But I will say that everything taken into account, DH is a damn decent experience.<br /><br />The first scene gives us a revealing look at Voldemort and the Death Eaters, as they all sit around a table to discuss their progress of universal domination. Most interesting is that Severus Snape takes part in this meeting; even after killing Dumbledore in the last installment, you as the viewer will still suspect that there was more to that situation than meets the eye. Snape is a complex person. It's too bad that Alan Rickman had next to nothing to do in Part I, but it's always a good diversion to look at the character and wonder what's going on inside his head (Rickman typically plays Snape very stoic and collected, unless the scene calls for something else). Luckily, you'll be treated to a lot of the character's backstory in Part II; that is, if they keep true to the novel, which in this case they -really- need to do.<br /><br />The gears begin to turn fast as we see Hermione wipe her parents' memories of their daughter, along with any indication inside of their home that she ever existed (photos of her fade into non-existence). Elsewhere, Harry stands outside 4 Privet Drive and watches the Dursleys as they hastily leave with only a few seconds of screen time (you don't hear me complaining). The film moves very fast from here until the camping scenes. If you want some time to take a breather, you'll have to wait a while.<br /><br />We follow our trio on a quest that's destination seems impossible to reach, both to them and we the viewers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione need to find the horcruxes in order to stop Voldemort from ever reincarnating, but at the same time they have to evade the countless Death Eaters and Voldemort sympathizers that have infiltrated both the basic wizarding world and the Ministry of Magic itself. They all have strong doubts that their mission can ever be successful. You'll feel that doubt along with them, because this film is filled with introspective moments and rising tensions: Harry is determined, but at the same time jaded and lost. You can hear it in Daniel Radcliffe's voice, see it in his eyes. Hermione is devoted to helping the cause, always providing clear evidence of her own competence and the incompetence of the two young men. She has to be at the top of her game in this new wizarding world of intolerance, being a muggle-born. Ron's storyline is reminiscent of 'The Goblet of Fire' in that he wrestles with feelings of inadequacy when placed next to Harry, and in DH he goes over the edge (though partly due to the evil influence of the locket horcrux, a nice nod to the One Ring from 'The Lord of the Rings').<br /><br />My favorite parts, and what I believe are also objectively the best parts, all pertain to camping. The trio are isolated in their trips across the wilds of Britain; it's being out in the middle of nowhere that we learn most about them as characters, and realize how much they've matured over the course of the series. In the past Harry has depended on the Dursleys, Dumbledore, the Weasleys, but now he's on his own, calling the shots and cutting out a shaky existence for himself and his friends. Harry Potter is a man now.<br /><br />This film is darker than I imagined the story being while reading the book. While many of the events that transpire in both book and film are essentially the same, the film's execution makes the story all the more hopeless, cynical, and gritty. One scene that stands out is when Harry and Ron come up the stairs from the Malfoy's basement to find Hermione lying on the cold, hard floor with ""mudblood"" carved into her flesh, presumably from Bellatrix's dagger. For me, this was more moving than any death that happened in the films thus far; maybe it's because Avada Kedavra is a painless release from life, whereas the torture and degradation of Hermione leaves the viewer with the impression that Hermione will have to relive those moments in her mind for the remainder of her life.<br /><br />In the following scene, when the trio escape the clutches of the Death Eaters, we are met with the sudden death of Dobby the house-elf. I see this as being the ultimate end to Harry's childhood (moreso than the death of Hedwig earlier in the film). With Dobby gone, there is nothing innocent and endearing left in Harry's life to anchor him to his earlier years at Hogwarts. Dobby was always an annoying character, but a lovable character. You couldn't help but feel warmth at his efforts to save Harry Potter time and time again, even when those attempts endangered Harry's physical well-being. When Harry buries Dobby, he's also burying the last remnants of that special magic from the first few films. There is nothing sweet left in the universe until Harry can manage to defeat Lord Voldemort, once and for all. As someone who has read the book, I warn you that there are many more deaths to come in Part II. Major characters start dropping like flies.<br /><br />While darkness isn't a positive attribute in and of itself, it's a framework wherein a lot of meaningful things can happen. Usually through loss or death. And a lot of that happens in the Harry Potter series. The screenplay writer, Steve Kloves, delivers much of the potential that comes alongside mature storytelling; as J.K. Rowling did to some degree in the novel itself.<br /><br />If I had to think of something to complain about, it'd be that the film moves too fast in places. It's already two and a half hours. I believe it would've been a good idea to stretch that out a little further to give these scenes more time to play out, so that the finished product didn't seem like such a flash before your eyes.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

When I get a Blu-ray player I will already have Blu-ray and not have to re-buy all my movies.<br /><br />Let me say I did not buy this from Amazon..I bought it from target when it was on sale. Never the less this ia a GREAT BUY!<br /><br />this combo pack comes with three(3) discs. the first on is the actual Movie on BLU-RAY the second disc is a BLU-RAY disc of BONUS FEATURES(ones such as the maximum movie mode and etc.) the 3rd and final disc is a DVD of the movie.(NOTE: the DVD Does NOT include ANY bonus features. It is just the movie it's self)<br /><br />Since I do not have a Blu-rya player I cannot comment on the blu-ray disc(s),But I'm sure they are wonderful!<br /><br />a couple days after I bought it I went of to my cousin's house for the evening to watch the movie. we watched it on their ig screen TV(the older ""projection"" kind with the fat back) and the DVD's quality was pretty good on it. then just last night we played it on our own HD plasma TV(720p) tv and it looked even better!!! I don't know what people are saying about it being horribly dark. the movie is dark,cause it takes place mostly at night. but the colors where some of the best I've seen!!!<br /><br />as for the movie it's self,I think this is one of the best HPs!!!I really liked it cause the trio really got to show how good they can act and there was a lot of emotion and really good dialogue.<br /><br />so,I would recommend this movie and combo pack to anyone who wants to own both the Blu-ray and DVD and get the Digital copy as an added bonus!<br /><br />I would also like to note that the Blu-ray ""packaging"" is really good and solid..really feels nice in the hands and doesn't feellike it would easily break.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Previously, the wand fights were a little slow and nothing you hadn't seen before. In this film, the wand fights are unexpected and like something from a shoot out in a cops and robbers film.<br /><br />The performances are excellent, and the quality of the film as a whole is very good. I am not giving this five stars just yet, not until I see the final film.<br /><br />Two hours well spent.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

This movie is set at a slower pace than previous Harry Potter movies, and is not the typical Hogwarts setting.  For non book readers it might not be their favorite, until they see part2.  If you are a book reader I think it is a wonderful movie that was able to stay more true to the book than most of the previous movies.  Despite the fact that it is a bit slower moving, there is still action and adventure that will keep you on your toes.

4942551,B004WMKSH2, A3DN3A4FI5JQGR,4.0, Overall a good movie,"This movie is good overall. It can be entertaining and fun. Some parts, however, were either slow or kind of silly. For instance, when Ron leaves the group, barely anything happens. Of course, that's not the case. Harry gets to see his parents graves, which should it have been a strong scene, but it didn't felt like that.  Also, it didn't felt like these guys knew what they were doing and when they went to the Ministry of Magic. This is extra, but didn't Harry saved hundreds of wizards that day? Well I guess they missed that too. I had a lot of expectations and maybe that's why I'm a bit disappointed. But I'm pretty sure most people will like it.<br /> This purchase actually includes a blu-ray, a DVD and a digital copy, which you can redeem using iTunes or Windows Media Player. It also includes a sneak peek to a scene from HP 7 part 2. For me this seemed like an awesome deal. I own many portable iDevices which stream my computer content or syncs as well.

4942557,B004WMKSH2, A18HHKM6WGEF9D,5.0," Excellent - Captures the Dark, Stark Shift of the Book","The 7th Harry Potter book marks a distinct shift in the series, as Dumbledore is dead, Harry and friends are no longer at Hogwarts, and the world is facing a dark future that only they can prevent. This film captures those shifts beautifully. Harry, Ron and Hermione are grown, and feeling the weight of the world on their shoulders. This is a somber film, so different from the first few, but very powerful. The director used the landscape beautifully in this film to convey the stark, dark feeling of this phase of their quest, and the impact of wearing the 2nd Horcrux. From dreary woods to desolate cliffs and beachsides, the settings are gorgeous, empty, and spooky. The three leads put in their best and subtlest performances to date - no more mugging for the camera. They convey both their deep affections and inner turmoils brilliantly. Dream sequences are gorgeous, and the animated telling of the story of the 3 brothers (the genesis of the deathly hallows of the title) is brilliant. I also loved the scene where Hermione and Harry briefly take off the Horcrux and dance - just a moment of joy before they reshoulder their burden.<br /><br />My only warning would be that this film will make no sense to someone not familiar with the books or other movies. While some of the past movies have been OK as standalones, this one requires prior knowledge of the story, and very little is offered as explanation for those that don't already know. I'm fine with that - this is the 7th film after all.<br /><br />Anyway, a wonderful setup for the final film!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942558,B004WMKSH2, A1DXA6ZGQA3T7D,4.0, Mostly well done,"I'm a bit of a purist, and we are impossible to please for the most part.  I liked the fact that the movie tried very hard to stick to the main important plot elements of the story, but because this is a book (a LONG book) turned into a movie, they had to rush the plot in order to fit things in, and this was worsened by the addition of a completely STUPID scene of Harry and Hermione dancing to the radio after Ron's desertion.  Completely pointless, and the time they wasted on it could have been put to sooo much better use - expanding on the story of Regulus Black, for example.  Ah well.

I expect non-readers will be perplexed.<br /><br />So many scenes have dark lighting, perhaps a modern artistic fad, while dramatic perhaps, I do not find such cinematography interesting.<br /><br />As a Potter story it is ok.

4942561,B004WMKSH2, AHDNXNNWCFX65,5.0, Excellent movie,I have read all the Harry Potter books and seen all of the movies our so far. This one is not my favorite but still quite a fun movie. Can't wait for the next one. I appreciate when a movie follows the book without adding too much of their own dramatic influences and this one is true to the book.,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942562,B004WMKSH2, A3I41MF1O2FAC,5.0, Exceeded Expectations,"The acting was outstanding. I've always felt Rupert Grint as Ron was the most natural of the trio but up until now he hasn't had much to work with, usually stuck as comic relief. Finally he got to show off more of his skill in some real dramatic moments. Emma Watson's Hermione was the weakest to me in the first five films, overacting and constantly wiggling her eyebrows. Thankfully she improved in HBP and got even better this time! I thought the two of them outshone Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, who was good, don't get me wrong. He just slightly paled in comparison to the other two. The supporting cast was equally good. Peter Mullan was very intimidating as Yaxley and even better than I imagined him in the book. Nick Moran's Scabior played a bigger role than in the book and was almost alluring in a really creepy way. Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix was a touch toned down from the previous films, which I was grateful for. I was also so glad we finally got to meet Bill Weasley and Mundungus Fletcher.<br /><br />The soundtrack was really good. I particularly loved Obliviated in the beginning because it caught my attention right away and Farewell to Dobby because it was so beautiful and moving. The cinematography was also excellent. I wasn't fond of the camping scenes in the book but I didn't mind them in the movie because of the gorgeous location shots! Nearly all of the individual scenes were well-done, with a perfect balance of drama, action, and comedy. My favorites were Hermione erasing her parents' memories and the silver doe. I was confused about the Harry/Hermione dance scene because I felt it was a bit out of character for Harry, but it was actually pretty cute.<br /><br />The film wasn't perfect. My two biggest complaints were the lack of explanation for the mirror shard and no use of the invisibility cloak. Since the cloak is one of the Hallows, wouldn't it have made sense to remind the non-hardcore audience about it? Similarly, those who haven't read the books will be scratching their heads trying to figure out where Harry got the mirror shard.I also felt Ginny was really a nonentity. Hers and Harry's romance was poorly treated in HBP as well and I was disappointed that it was more of the same this time.<br /><br />My other complaints are really minor quibbles in comparison. I missed seeing Dudley and Harry's handshake, even though the movie works perfectly fine without it. I would have liked to see Harry and Ron hug after the destruction of the locket and have Harry assure Ron that he only sees Hermione as a sister (especially since some viewers thought he was trying to come on to Hermione in the dance scene!). I also felt Malfoy Manor, while a nice scene in itself, paled in comparison to the book. It was slightly rushed and watered down- namely Ron's reaction and Wormtail's fate. I suppose this was done for a reason, and it does work in the movie- but the book scene was so much better.<br /><br />The end only made me want Part II right now! I guess I'll have to reread the book to satisfy myself until July.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942563,B004WMKSH2, A2BNHR5F1KBAO1,5.0, Great Show,The movie is well made.  The movie is made on the slowest part of the books so it was hard to make fun to watch.

Definitely one of the best in the entire Harry Potter movie series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One was suspenseful, dramatic, romantic, and always, always exciting.  It did a great job of fitting so much plot into a really great piece of film, and I was never bored.  Although the movie was a little dark (and I don't just mean the plot--it was a little hard to see what the characters were doing onscreen at times) I thought that they did a great job of staying true to the film and the feel of Harry Potter.  Not everyone in my group loved the movie, so I wouldn't recommend it to younger people under age eleven (unless they are Harry Potter fanatics), but overall I thought it was great.

4942565,B004WMKSH2, A1KMG1AIUS00DC,2.0," A lumbering, penultimate episode","""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I"" is being released on Blu-ray in plenty of time to capitalize on the final installment of the saga, due in theatres this July.  Warner Brothers decided to divide the last book of the series into two motion pictures to incorporate as much plot and as many characters from the novel as possible.<br /><br />Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is the primary obstacle to the total control by Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) of both the wizard and human worlds.  Voldemort has sent an army of Death Eaters to find the young wizard.  Accompanied by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), Harry embarks on a journey that finds him crossing paths with many of the characters he's previously encountered at Hogwarts.<br /><br />Director David Yates handles the action sequences effectively. The film starts with a terrific chase in which Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) turns many of Harry's closest friends into Potter clones to confuse the Death Eaters.  Another standout sequence is Harry and friends' infiltration of the Ministry of Magic.  Unfortunately, the film's pacing is sluggish and bogs down the proceedings considerably.<br /><br />This installment is far different in tone from the first.  It is darker and downbeat, plodding and repetitious.  The special effects, as usual in a Potter film, are very good, but the magic isn't there.  Back are familiar characters Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), and Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).<br /><br />The three-disc Combo Pack edition contains Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy versions of the movie.  The main extra is the opening scene of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part II.""  There are also additional scenes and several behind-the-scenes featurettes.

Stunning visuals and effects, and it's wonderful to see three once child actors now fine young adult actors.

The picture quality was near flawless, even when zoomed in. No artifacts in the bright white scenes (like when Ron gets slpinched) nor in the dark black scenes. I saw some very minor ones in only one scene.<br /><br />Player: I like that this Blu Ray does not use Java. So, when I turn off/on my player, the movie picks back up wherever I left off without having to do a bookmark and go through the FBI warnings and crap (like you do for Half-Blood Prince).<br /><br />Extras: So disappointing.

4942569,B004WMKSH2, A13DCIZTD3WPHS,5.0, An adventure of a lifetime,"I have read all the Harry Potter books and loved most of them.  I have not liked all the movies.  I think that in some movies important scenes were left out.  This one is the best one yet.  It differs some from the book but still retains what the book was about.  It had not seen that showed Neville being brave.  In the first book he was very afraid of most of everything.  He has changed with the help of Harry and his quest.  One seen from the book that I think they should had added more was when Ron returned and Ron and Hermione get into a little spat.  That scene was much better in the book.  You can see how unsure Harry is but he keeps trying.  Even when he learns some hurtful things he just keeps going.  His determination is unmatch by Tom Riddle.  I refuse to call him by the name he came up with.  It is not one he earned.  In this movie you see a side of Tom, the scared side.  He thought he was the best but now he knows he is not.  He faces a moment of self-doubt which he quickly overcomes.  I hated to see the end of this movie but I look forward to seeing Part II.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The movie is part 1 of the last book and has such a great cliffhanger that it is sad when the movie ends, I cannot wait to see the next movie!!!  --I do not want to give anything away (it is hard to talk about this movie without giving away an important aspect).<br /><br />On another note, the movie looks great in HD, but they left such large bars at the top and the bottom of the screen.  It is not bad, but it is like the old days when you would watch a Widescreen movie on a full screen unit.<br /><br />I have a question about what the special features (mainly the trailer for the next movie) are...  After watching the movie on the  ""Movie: Blu-Ray"" disk, I went to Special Features and there was only an option for watching the movie in different manners.  I put the second disk ""Special Features: Blu-Ray"" in and it loaded and went to the main menu, but there was no option except Language and Special Features (which had no options other than language and subtitles).  It was strange, because the player would not move normal, I had to use inverted controls to move.<br /><br />In all this was a great movie, and a must watch, I was hoping to see the trailer for the new movie, however, I guess it is time to start surfing the net looking for it myself.  :)",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942577,B004WMKSH2, A2H3JURQZOHVMB,5.0, Harry Potter and the Dramatic Hallows,"While keeping the plot discreet, I must start off by saying that this one of the best installments of the series to have come out since the first movie. I have been fortunate in being able to see all the Harry Potter installments, including this one. However, I must say that from my perspective, that the movie is so intense, that anyone that is 12 or under may need a person to accompany them that is at least 18 or over. I say this only because I feel that this movie is terrific, but it is much more intense than the other installments. This movie finds Harry Potter and his friends coming to terms with learning who is truthfully on their side and the people that he knew that went to the dark side. There is strong romantic chemistry between both Hermoine and Harry and Hermoine and Ron that you end up wondering how the future between the three of them is going to unfold. From the beginning the movie carefully paints a picture that one cannot overcome the trials of life alone. Once again in this movie, the viewer gets to see many of the people that are going to be a part in helping Harry and his friends along their journey. This series has alot of good special effects and scenery that both adults and children are going to love. The plot, all the way up to the ending is very well developed that time really flies when you see the movie. Many of the events in the movie are very exciting and leave you in suspense. Last, but not least, I enjoyed the Harry Potter movie that was released last summer. However, I would have to say that this movie (the Deathly Hallows one) is definitely better than last years, and many like myself are going to feel that it is even better than the first (which is saying alot, because the first installment is a classic).",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942578,B004WMKSH2, A2B9EGK9RW2QGW,3.0, Not the Ultimate Edition (Four Disc Deluxe Edition Review),"I bought this items because I thought MAYBE it'd be the Ultimate Edition. Many of us fans who bought years 1-6 Ultimate Editions have been waiting for the last two movies to release as an Ultimate Edition. All that's been said is that they will release some time in 2012. I've been searching all around for any information, but no luck.<br /><br />I then see this product ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 (Four-Disc Blu-ray Deluxe Edition)"" I think maybe this is the edition I've been looking for! I go into the product details and see it says ""Ultimate Edition."" I think to myself how Amazon has had some shoddy details on other products. They may list DTS HD Master Audio on blu rays as plain old DTS 5.1. They also sometimes list anime as English or Japanese only, but they're really dual audio. I go for it and buy it.<br /><br />I got the item today. It looks just like the regular Blu Ray copy, but it also comes with a DVD and Digital Copy. The four discs are the movie (blu ray), the movie (dvd), special features, and a bonus disc. And the special lenticular cover is glued onto a basic thick paper sleeve. I should also mention the sleeve had a bar code sticker stuck to it (from Amazon) which covered up the bar code on the blu ray box. The sticker tore apart when I tried to remove it, slightly tearing and leaving pieces of the sticker on the sleeve.<br /><br />Well, at least I have a copy of the deathly hallows on blu ray. I decided to buy part 2 for super cheap as well. I may just wait for the real ultimate editions to come out...whenever that may be.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The bookend is not very heavy, so it would be fine to use with DVDs (as shown) or lighter books.  The black base he stands on does not go far under in the back, so it would probably not be suitable for use with heavier books.  Dobby is probably about 6"" tall.  I am very satisfied with this purchase as it was only a few bucks more than the DVD alone & I love the little house elf.  If you want all the extra interview stuff or bluray go with another version, but the extra novelty was worth it to me.  The special features on this DVD include additional scenes and language subtitles only, and it is in widescreen format.  Frankly I would anticipate some sort of collector pack being released when the last movie(deathly Hallows part II) comes out, so I will likely get all the years on bluray then.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

What I do, is I think of them as two separate story lines, because, with the exception of the fifth in my opinion, the movies themselves are fantastic.  The effects are good, and when I read the books now, I can't help but imagine these actors saying some of the lines.

The interpersonal dynamic is wonderful here, maturing just as the actors have. The deeply felt and often painful moments are interspersed -- gently and with grace -- by beautiful, tender moments. Hermione and Harry dancing in the tent, at the bleakest of moments, is a wonder to see and is alone worth the price of admission.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942585,B004WMKSH2, A3JLOIXFM75QNV,5.0, What a redemption!,"Hard to believe this is the beginning of the end for this series. But what a way to go out! As much as I love the Harry Potter series, I was utterly dissapointed at the last two films. They strayed so far from the source material, I was quite honestly shocked and truly feared for the rest of he series. Well, I am pleased to say that Part 1 of Deathly Hallows is near perfection. High praise, yes, but I truly felt it did the book (at least the first part) justice. People have been complaining that not much happens and it is very slow-moving. Well, yes it is, but again, that is not so different from the book. The first part is a journey and sort of a teaser for the grand finale. Though not much action occurs, it is still quite interesting and truly suspensful. Especially if you've never read the books(which is just astonishing to me since they are a million times better than the movies).<br /><br />The characters are so grown up now and with that comes so much more emotion, and drama. The Half-Blood Prince contained too much humour, I thought. But Deathly Hallows Pt.1 contains just the right amount of everything. All the actors do an incredible job, even Dan Radcliffe, who I've always seen as the weakest link in the series. He's truly developed as an actor and did a wonderful job here. You can really feel the struggle these characters are going through on their journey.  It is just Harry, Ron and Hermione alone in the wilderness, trying to keep some sort of composure during their grim endevor. I do have to say one thing though: My favorite character in the series, Severus Snape, has literally one scene. I was extrememly dismayed but can only hope for more in the second part. Even with that one scene, he steals the show.<br /><br />The imagery is fantastic, the musical score is just right, the cinematography is first-rate. Aside from a couple of odd scenes, which were not in the book, I could really find nothing to complain about. I'm glad they decided to split the book, I think it was the best decision for this film and the entire series.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942587,B004WMKSH2, A3RNIOJ1Y0R1AT,5.0, 13 year Potter fan pleased with results,"I have judged and ridiculed every single Harry Potter film because I have read the books since I was 8, and now here we are at the end. While book 7 is filled with sooo much information, any things left out comprising the first half I think we were able to do without. Obviously movies will not be as good as books, they never are, but this film did a really good job on sticking with the script. After it was over I was pleased and of course sad about Dobby and all of that. It did happen like I imagined it would and overall I think Yates did an exceptional job. As for the actors, Dan, Emma, and Rupert all did extraordinary, and I loved the added scene of Emma in her 'muggle home,' very sad. I loved new people brought in (Bill Nighy, Rhys Ifans) and I thought they did great portraying their characters. Obviously this film lacked some action because a lot of it was tying loose ends together, but all the action we will see in this next installment, which will prove the be the saddest and most heart-wrenching of them all. Coming from someone who has reread this final book 7 times, I found it to be complete and explanatory. If you haven't watched the other films recently or only halfheartedly paid attention you might misunderstand or just not understand some things, but if it was all nicely laid out for us and didn't require any thought whatsoever then...well, we'd just call it Twilight. I give this 5 stars and anxiously await the final film to see how this grand finale turns out.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942588,B004WMKSH2, A1D4NUM28WIO94,1.0, Harry Potter and the Deathly Boring Plot,"I found this movie dreary, interminable, and boring.  Around 1/4 way through, I ceased caring about Harry Potter and the whole confusing mess and stuck it out for another 1/3 until I gave up and went to bed.  I fast-forwarded through the rest of it this afternoon while my wife secluded herself so she could watch it later.  I felt the same way about the books as the series progressed, so it's not surprising.  It's also got the darkest (literally) cinematography and lighting I've ever seen on film.  I can't recommend this movie for anyone except the most devout fans, who've no doubt already seen it and will love it no matter what I say.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

He is now settled in on the mantel along with the loot I brought back from Harry Potter World in Orlando.<br /><br />The film was a wonderful surprise as I didn't get to see it in the theater. The director/screen writer did not add anything to the story to boost his ego and managed to insert important details left out of previous films to make the story hang together.  Was the best film version of the books since the first 2 movies.<br /><br />For some reason, film makers still insist on equating dark deeds with a dark screen so parts are difficult to make out but it's not as bad as I feared.<br /><br />Overall, I'm extremely pleased with both Dobby and the film and feel I got good value for my money.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

It would have been helpful if the product description had made this clear. And, after downloading the digital copy for hours, it would not play on my ZEN. All in all, I would have been better off just renting Deathly Hallows from Amazon and watching it on ROKU.

Really?,"Hi, I just wanted to say that I totally thought that splitting the movie into two parts was the best idea the writers and producers could have had. this book was so detailed that it would have been a tragedy to keep it in one movie. The movie left me excited for the second part. There were some intense parts and funny parts. I find a movie with all this exciting and the detail and feelings went in well.  The acting by all was very good showing frustration and love and admiration, this movie is different from the others as it doesn't make you scream because they added too much that wasn't there and not enough of what was. Harry in the cupboard at the beginning showed just how big he's grown and how small he was when he started.  I simply cannot wait for this movie to come out on dvd and to see the part 2 in the theaters",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942594,B004WMKSH2, A3NZQ0KTNYMVGL,5.0," Best of the 7 books, and one of the best of the movies","This movie is by far a lot better than the last two movies, and it might even beat the Goblet of Fire. The first three movies are the best, and this one is right up there with them. Some people think this was boring, but for me it was not at all. Even my friend who doesn't like Harry Potter loved this movie. I thought it was brilliantly made and this was one of those movies that are so good that you don't look to see what time it is and you don't wonder ""is this almost over?"".<br /><br />Can't wait for the finale!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942595,B004WMKSH2, A3G7791C60V6U5,5.0, DEATHLY HALLOWS BUY IT!!!,"Deathly Hallows more than blew me way...Rupert Grint and Emma Watson completely stole the show-their chemistry with each other as the bickering, falling completely in love with each other Ron and Hermione was funny, sweet, and at one time sad to watch (because you see how much Ron and Hermione love each other but are afraid to show it yet). Their performances really blew me away-watch Emma's performance when Ron gets splinched or her torture scene; watch Rupert's performance when he is all jealous of Harry and Hermione or his ""speech"". But the best is when Ron returns and Hermione is not exactly ""welcoming back with open arms"" ;) Their relationship was just fun to watch throughout the entire film and will be even more incredible to watch in part 2 as their relationship evolves further :) As for Dan Radcliffe-his highlighted moment was def 7 Potters!!! He was AMAZING there. Dan also does a great job of showing the emotional rollercoaster he is feeling about putting his best friends' lives in danger. As for the movie itself-the scenery was breathtaking, the writing incredible (*very true to the book), the acting superb-the trio, the older adult actors. I saw DH 8 times and would pay to see it another 8 times. I even have friends who dont see movies over again and they have even seen it more than once now! Buy DH!! Wont be disappointed.

4942596,B004WMKSH2, A1M39P7MO277FV,5.0, A Memorable One For the Loyal Fan,"For the Harry Potter fandom the wait for a new movie has been quite rewarding. Deathly Hallows Part I, has very successfully built up the suspense and the curiosity of the myriad of Potter fans, who will now wait restlessly for the final climax of the series. Followers of Harry Potter and his two friends, who have grown up simultaneously with the fictional trio, would have found the confusions, frustrations and rage of the stormy teenage years very familiar. The plot deals with a lot of real emotions, the emotions and aches of growing up, of being challenged. There is jealousy, anger and empathy--these human emotions mark a departure of Deathly from the bravado and mindless adventures of the earlier Potter flicks.<br /><br />Harry, Ron and Hermione escape from the numerous attacks of the Death Eaters, let loose by Voldemort. The killing mission includes a high adrenalin chase of Harry and his seven look-alikes by the blood thirsty gang, which is a high point of the movie, visually. Potter and friends escape into the wilderness, but the Death Eaters' attacks never come to an end, and their goons capture and take them to the lair.<br /><br />The trio escapes from the dungeon with the help of elf Dobby who pays with his life in the effort to release them. Dobby's death in the lap of Harry Potter brings about the most poignant scene in the movie. Now Harry and friends come to learn about the Deathly Hallows, based on some symbols and their intuitions. Hermione's reading of the story about the seven deathly hallows is accompanied by a symbolic enactment, which is very captivating and will remain deeply etched in the viewer's mind for long.<br /><br />While the development of the plot is very intelligent and flawless, there are certain issues about the pace of the movie. Some parts drag, especially the lengthy discussions and deliberations. The many ifs and buts during the unfolding of the plot frustrate the viewer, used to the fast pace of the childhood adventure and games of the earlier movies. Most of the action takes place in the outside world, away from the all too familiar school premises. That's a welcome change.<br /><br />Finally the fights and misunderstandings between Harry and Ron depict the coming of age of the chums.<br /><br />The die-hard fans will surely revel in the movie despite the fact the director David Yates has taken a lot of liberty about his selection of which part of the book to include in the movie and which to leave out.  For the uninitiated, though, this random and non-linear selection may appear quite disjointed and confusing.<br /><br />Chinmay Hota<br />Author of 'Hits and Misses'",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942597,B004WMKSH2, AIT3L2OSJNPZ6,5.0, This Is Bigger Than You Harry.,"Oh how dimwitted yet incredibly intelligent Ron can be at times, as the above statement shows. He understands that the war that Voldomort has waged isn't just about Harry. Yes, he is a huge factor; but not the whole reason. And this film really starts to show us just how big this ""war"" has become. Reaching so far as to take over the ""secure"" and ""powerful"" Ministry of Magic, and even taking over the sacred halls of Hogwarts itself.<br /><br />But, Harry is still a large part of the war. He is the figure that the good stand behind now that the thought to be immortal Dumbledore is no more.  And with that knowledge, so this film begins. Dumbledore is dead, and Harry is left clueless as to what he is to do with the fragments of knowledge that were left to him. He knows he must destroy the remaining Horocruxes; magical items housing split pieces of Voldomorts soul, keeping him immortal. But what are these items, how do you destroy them, and most importantly how do you find them. This is the main focus of Part 1. After realizing that he is not safe anywhere he goes, Harry with his trusted friends Ron and Hermione go on the run to find these remaining objects and learn how to destroy them.<br /><br />Deathly Hallows is one of the most well structured films of the series to date. Many things that the amazing J.K. Rowling wrote in the novel would have weighed the film version down and made it feel disjointed, but Steve Kloves has done a magical job at finding the root story, and side stories that are relevant to this. He has also given us one of the most emotional scripts, delivered with true and powerful performances by all; particularly by our core three. Daniel, Emma and Rupert have truly become amazing actors/actresses. So many scenes in this film are very depressing and filled with tension and all three deliver. Small additions also make the film all that much more amazing. The dance that Harry and Hermione share after Ron abandons the cause, is truly heart felt and sweet.<br /><br />But the action and set design are also astounding. The opening chase sequence with the multiple Harry's being chased by the death eaters through the skies and streets of London was amazing and intense. And the infiltration of the Ministry to steal one of the horocruxes is ingenious and while funny, very intense as well, and also gives us the chance to once again see the amazing Imelda Staunton as the ever nasty Dolores Umbridge. The chase between the snatchers and the trio near the end of the film is also very intense.<br /><br />Giving props to Daniel, Emma and Ron is commendable but the supporting cast is also amazing. Ray Fiennes as Voldomort is as always creepy and nasty as Voldomort. And Alan Rickman; although underused; steals every scene his character Severus Snape is in. But I must say that the stand out in this film to me was Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange who played the role with such cunning and murderous venom that she stole each and every scene she was in. Her torturing of Hermione was a terrifying scene to hear and behold.<br /><br />Death is also a major theme in this film, we loose several loved characters and many people are scene dead or worse in the film, so to all those thinking of taking their little kids, I'd say no. The film is very dark and morbid, and has a very forboding sense of dread hanging over it. This is not Chamber of Secrets or even Order of the Phoenix.<br /><br />I was immensely satisfied with this film, even if it was incomplete, but it is a step in the right direction. I have been, unlike some, very impressed with the last few films, enjoying the more mature and tense filled films.<br />With Half Blood Prince being my favorite to date, even better in my opinion than this one. So if your wanting to see a truly gripping film than go see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Any light washes out the picture.<br /><br />The sound quality is not very good as well. It is either too low or VERY LOUD.<br /><br />This version is not worth the price even at a 75% discount.<br />I would hope they can re-cut this in the light of day.<br /><br />It appears that success has not been good for the Harry Potter series.,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942599,B004WMKSH2, A12FLZREV32JOP,5.0," Perhaps it deserves a lower rating, but I loved it so much","Though Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One is a blockbuster about teenage wizards, the seventh in the Harry Potter series is more ambiguous and thematically relevant than many movies about adults. The plot will baffle those who have either not seen the previous film or read J. K. Rowling's bestselling books.<br /><br />The wicked Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) gathers his band of Death Eaters to create a world where muggles (non-magical humans) are subservient to wizards. Voldemort himself echoes Hitler's makeup in that he is half-muggle, and pamphlets strewn throughout the film (including one titled ""when muggles attack"") resemble Nazi propaganda.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) abandon their final year at the magical school of Hogwarts to embark on a quest to destroy Voldemort. To do this, they must find six horcruxes, objects containing pieces of Voldemort's soul.<br /><br />Deathly Hallows: Part One, the second to last film, is more appropriate for teenagers than young children. From the barren scenery to the shuddering, downcast portrait of Harry on a wanted poster, a sense of despair pervades the atmosphere. As our three young heroes struggle with uncertainty, their friendship is put to the test.<br /><br />Seasoned British thespians including Bill Nighy and Helena Bonham Carter have little more than cameos, but most minor characters are well handled. Memorable roles include Alan Rickman's icy Snape, David Thewlis's kind werewolf Lupin (in human form), and Imelda Staunton's creepy interrogator Dolores Umbridge.<br /><br />Voldemort's hosts, Death Eaters Draco (Tom Felton) and Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), exemplify the crumbling upper class. Humiliated by Voldemort and lower-class thugs, the snobbish Malfoys discover how overturning the social order can negatively affect them.<br /><br />The odious but helpful house-elf Kreachure, a CGI creation, is marvelously voiced by Simon McBurney. The more heroic house-elf Dobby (Toby Jones) is less successful. He comes across as more cartoonish than inspiring.<br /><br />But the heart of this film is the trio. Due to the amount of material crammed into each movie, Hermione and Ron have often felt more like sidekicks than complete characters. Here their acting, especially Ms. Watson's, has improved and their conflicts are fleshed out.<br /><br />We see Hermione's sacrifice as she erases her muggle family's memories in order to protect them. One of the youngest and least powerful in a large family of strong wizards, Ron and his insecurities also emerge, as does his resentment about the relationship between the famous Harry and overachieving Hermione.<br /><br />Ron and Hermione's unspoken romance is humorous, frustrating, and sweet. While Hermione notes that she is ""always mad"" at Ron, she and Harry have a more harmonious and platonic connection. Their closeness is demonstrated in the film's most moving scene, when Harry dances with Hermione. Though not in the book, this moment of joy is a counterpoint to the darkness that takes up so much of the film, and the dance dissolves when they recall the complexity of their situation.<br /><br />The most creative part of the film, arguably of the entire series, is a curious but fascinating animation of The Tale of the Three Brothers. Nicely read by Ms. Watson, the story of Death's encounter with three brothers is grim, eerie, and hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />The film is by no means perfect. It has its share of melodrama, and Alexandre Deslpat's usually lovely score can be laughably over-the-top. Long pauses prolong an already lengthy movie. Part One's abrupt ending isn't particularly satisfying; the audience will have to wait until Part Two for a real conclusion.<br /><br />Still, it is touching to see the tired and worn triumvirate walk past charred trailer homes as they listen to death tolls on the radio. Hardly older than children, they have to learn that heroism is more tedious than glorious. With only one more film to go, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One manages to be the most emotionally resonant Harry Potter movie yet.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942600,B004WMKSH2, A1OE9Z1KSQ0TMX,1.0, 2011 BluRay DVD combo & 2 disc DVD special edition,"I love the Harry Potter series.  This is not a review about the movie itself.  Go to IMDB for that.  This is a review of the product.  I am a total visual quality snob.  This is without a doubt one of the worst movie transfers I have ever seen.  HORRIBLE!!!  I bought the 2 disc special edition DVD first.  My initial thought was that Warner Bros had purposefully sabotaged the DVD quality in order to provoke people into investing in BluRay, which would then reveal the true potential of quality.  So I returned the 2 disc special edition DVD for the DVD/BluRay combo.  Alas!  The BluRay was just as horrible.  I know it's hard to wait, but I would really encourage people to NOT let Warner Bros make a profit on such a shoddy product: reject this release.  Maybe they will get the hint that with general sales getting lower and lower each year, that they can't just abuse their customers without consequences.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942601,B004WMKSH2, A35OA53L058D6X,1.0," Very Boring, Dull and Ugly Film",I never would have purchased this if I had realized how agonizing it would be to watch it.  All of the colors have been sucked out of this production and the contrast has been turned up too far.  It's a depressing film that just goes on and on with nothing happening.  The music is bad.  It is the worst of the all the Potter films.,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942602,B004WMKSH2, A36DDI3ETVFQZ,1.0, It is Magic!!! It put me to sleep in the middle of the day.,"I hardly remember the book and this movie did little to refresh my memory. I do recall how Rowling wasted 200 pages with Hermione & Harry apparating around the country doing NOTHING, and the overall impression of being underwhelmed by the story (or lack thereof).<br /><br />I thought they would cut short all the Harry & Hermione ""on the run"" sequence from the book since it doesn't do anything to advance the story. But I was so wrong.  There is  what seems like 12 hours of nothing but H&H camping, again doing nothing to advance the story.<br /><br />There is so little action, so little dialog and so many slow-moving scenes that I couldn't watch the whole thing.  I started fast forwarding after about an hour that felt like half a day and only watched scenes where people actually talked to each other (rather than just staring at each other) or some action, no matter how meager, was taking place.<br /><br />I did enjoy the ""Three Brothers"" sequence. The animation was very interesting and unusual.  As for the rest of the film I recommend that if you must see it, you rent it or see at a theater, but don't waste your money on buying it.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942603,B004WMKSH2, A1RSXP7MB772E3,5.0," Emotional, Scary, Gripping, and Sensational!","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 gives the intense feeling of a world that is dangerous. And being that I have grown up with Harry, Hermoine, and Ron, I feel for them as I would for a family member. There are true scenes of terror in this latest movie, and the music can be very alarming. I got the feeling I was watching a well done political thriller at times. This movie is almost entirely about the characters that we love most: Harry, Hermoine, and Ron. In my opinion some of the best acting of the franchise is displayed in this excellent movie.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows was almost painful for me to watch though, as I have grown up with these characters and I care for them all so much. Harry, Hermoine, and Ron are still young, but the cruel world throws them out into the fire where anything may meet them! They are hiding, scared, and alone from powerful forces bent on their deaths. Everything they love is in peril, or has fallen and nobody can be trusted outside of themselves. The thoughts of the loved ones left behind drive them to stay up all night thinking about them in unconsolible agony. The three camp in woods, with only enough supplies to survive, and in places little traveled by people. Each wearing thinner daily by the impossible burden of perhaps being the last hope.<br /><br />The warm guidance and protection of those that love them are ALL gone except in memory. It is up to them, with barely enough knowledge to suffice, and definately not enough experience! And it drives me to worrying fits, because I don't know what's going to happen to these kids. I have refrained myself from reading the novels until I have seen all the movies. I have kept myself from overhearing anything about the books, and now I am in complete mystery, and it thrills me, but also it holds me in agony at times. I was reminded how young these guys still are when Hermoine was crying like a child. I wanted to protect her and kill the people who harmed her! You forget how young the characters are because of how grim, and aged they behave at times.<br /><br />It is not only their world that is in peril, but the world that I have come to know extensively, and that I have appreciated, and held in my imagination with awe and wonder. It seems every new movie had been a slow death of that world. A piece of it would die and not return. There are real consequences in this world, though it be fantasy, it is filled with real moments of loss. Every scene is weighted down with danger. Every corner is dangerous, and may have some terrible consequence. Terrible thoughts went through my head; and there were times when I had lost hope. I can't remember when I watched a movie with such emotional responses.<br /><br />This is a movie that I instantly loved, and will watch many, many times. I am convinced that the end movie will be historic. I cannot wait for next July for the supreme finale. I am sad that it is coming to an end, but I am also very happy that it will be filmed will nearly all of the original cast in the end. I believe this is the movie of the year. Enough of this ""It's a good harry potter movie."" No, it's a great, epic MOVIE. I highly recommend this tragic, Dangerous, and Emotional movie.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942604,B004WMKSH2, A3CBV65IHPIQS4,1.0, Great movie on a horrible disc,"If you're interested in this excellent movie, buy a different version...this one was so poorly done, so over-compressed, that characters' heads jumped around by several pixels while standing still, and faces were occasionally obscured by football-sized ""artifacts"" -- junk on the screen that should not have been there.  Yuck!  We'll be upgrading to one of the multi-disc versions and hoping that the compression was better done there.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Unfortunately, the quality of the disc I received leaves much to be desired. The quality is so dark I have to completely blacken the room (never watch during the day) in order to make out what is on screen. The first time I watched it, I found myself having to remember snatches from the book in order to know what was going on on screen. The video was so dark I could hear voices, but not make out the action.<br /><br />I may have to re-purchase from some other source.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942606,B004WMKSH2, A1HGBVQDZ8RGYE,3.0," Great Movie, TERRIBLE transfer / picture quality!!!","Great road trip movie.  A bit slow at times, but excellent character building, and even some decent acting by the main three.  They really have come a long ways.  Especially Harry / Daniel who over the past few films has grown immensely as an actor.<br /><br />However, I am SO, SO sick of the studios PURPOSEFULLY doing a bad job on their DVD transfers only to promote Blu-Rays.  The explosion of combo packs has driven this further, because many folks with a 32"" or smaller 720p set can't see the difference between a Blu-Ray and upcoverted DVD...UNLESS the DVD is a *terrible* quality source.  The studios are now MALICIOUSLY doing horrible transfer jobs in order to make the Blu-Ray look better.  This is not conspiracy theory.  Watch for yourself by comparing HP7 with HP4 or 5 on DVD!<br /><br />There is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON that the HP7 DVD should look this bad.  First off, it is only using a fraction of the available DVD dual-layer space available, and as such is *riddled* with compression artifacts.  You need no more proof than that, but the real proof is in the pudding!  Compare the HP4 and HP5 dark scenes with those in HP7 pt 1 and you will see NIGHT AND DAY difference in quality.  Things should be better today, not worse.  You can't tell me it was on accident.  This was almost certainly found and raised during quality control, and quietly snuffed by the marketing folks.  It was engineered this way on purpose.<br /><br />While we are a Blu-Ray household with 4 total BD players (living room, MBR, newest desktop, newest laptop), we have nearly a dozen DVD Players counting older laptops, desktops, portable DVD players, and cars.  Overall, this movie undoubtedly will be watched more on DVD than on BD.  We shouldn't be subjecdted to inferior quality just because some bozo in Marketing things it will impact BD sales 1% to 2%.  I don't care if he's right.  It's not fair.  We pay a good price for the DVD, and we should get a product that is the best possible for the money.  Not one that is artifcially neutered for marketing reasons!!!<br /><br />I blame Warner Brothers.  There is no excuse for this.  I do not feel this was an accident, and this needs to stop!<br /><br />Rhino",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942607,B004WMKSH2, A8ZY9LI1KBU2P,5.0, The Magic Is Back!,"I'm so very happy that I can recommend this one without any hesitation at all!<br /><br />The last couple Harry Potter films disappointed me in a myriad of ways. My disappointment didn't cause me to hate them, but I did feel let down and I have to admit that I found Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince pretty forgettable. But, being a Potter fan, I still found myself rushing out to see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I today. And to my great relief and happiness, I loved it - really loved it! Yeah!<br /><br />The chase of the Seven Potters by the Death Eaters and the trip to the Ministry of Magic are tense and exciting, the endless camping trip is just as effective at portraying the helplessness and frustration the characters are experiencing as it was in the book and the scene that gives us Hermione reading Beedle the Bard's ""Tale of the Three Brothers"" is riveting and wonderfully creative - much, much better than I would have thought it could be. We finally get to meet Bill (and Fleur's briefly-glimpsed wedding dress is gorgeous!) and the whipped cream on top of all this goodness is that the film is much more humorous than I expected. While not everything is included, of course, I didn't come out of this film grumbling things along the lines of ""How could they leave out _____?"" or ""Why did they add ________when it wasn't even in the danged book?"" - both comments I have been known to make after viewing some of the other films. Instead, I left the theater feeling like I'd seen a relatively faithful rendering of the ""real"" story. And there were even one or two things that I thought the film did better than the book, most notably the interruption of Harry & Ginny's kiss. The not-in-the-book added scene of Harry and Hermione dancing was both amusing and incredibly poignant - a true highlight of the film for me.<br /><br />For some reason, the enjoyment this film gave me seemed to lift some sort of weight off me - which seems a very odd thing to say, I know. I think it returned a good deal of the joy I found in the earlier films - when seeing the characters and the places come to life on the screen was so magical. (That first glimpse of Hogwarts!) In a way, I feel like I'm back *in* - that I'm once again immersed in the film version of the story in a way that more closely echoes the effect the books had on me. While the films, IMHO, can never hope to match the books, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, Part I, let me feel the magic again. For that I thank everyone involved with it.<br /><br />I thought the acting by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson was better than it's been in any of the Potter films - they really seem to have come into their own here. Helena Bonham Carter was freakishly perfect as usual, Jason Isaacs very good and Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood a welcome newcomer. The film sounds good - the score is a mood-setting addition to the film (especially effective, I thought, were the screeching radio sounds during many of the camping scenes) - and it looks even better. The shots of the English countryside are beautiful but often seem almost overwhelmingly empty and lonely - perfect for the story.<br /><br />When it was announced that Deathly Hallows would be split into two films, I was glad because I hoped that by doing so the filmmakers would be able to do justice to the complexities of Rowling's plot. And now, having seen Part I, I feel that they've succeeded in doing just that. After this, I can look forward to the last film, not with dread, but with pleasure. And I am incredibly thrilled to be able to say that.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!<br /><br />Some info and cautions on the products:<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: Because there are reports of various versions of the DVD available from different sellers, I strongly suggest buyers check the packaging carefully to ensure the version they are considering contains everything they're looking for.<br /><br />I purchased the 3-Disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy Combo Pack offered here on Amazon.

(I was fortunate enough to visit the Wizarding World recently and enjoyed it immensely. Those responsible for its creation have done a terrific job in creating an atmosphere true to the books and films. I particularly enjoyed the many small and delightful details they took care to include. Harry's youngest fans, though, may be disappointed that the rides are geared to older fans.)",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942608,B004WMKSH2, AO4WFALWQYTW0,5.0, A necessary and fitting buildup to a hopefully grand conclusion,"Walking out of the screeing, one of my friends remarked that he hated this Harry Potter film, stating it is the ""worst"" in the series. I disagree, but understand exactly why he thinks this way. As anyone who has read the book knows, a large part of the seventh book is buildup towards the definite battle that awaits. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Pt. 1 is just buildup.<br /><br />If you have read the book, you will enjoy this film as it is faithful to the spirit of the book; if you know Harry simply through the films, you might be disappointed. For it is filmed with camping in deserted locations, forests, and other odd locations to escape from Voldermort's grasp. This is really why some critics absolutely hate this film as they can not fathom the amount of buildup this film does. However, if they want to criticize anyone, they should critique Rowling as this is a faithful adaption of her book.<br /><br />Radcliffe and Grint are great as always, but the welcome surprise is Emma Watson whose acting has gotten better and better, and she reaches a new peak. She balances each relationship very decisively , putting different emotional layers in treating Harry and Ron.  In addition, the landscapes are as gorgeous as ever, and the special effects have become surprisingly better-especially Voldermort's snake which sent chills through my spine.<br />The emotion the film induces does something that the book never did for me. It takes it out of this magical world, and into the real world, and makes the evil present in Harry's World seem like the fear many people battling evil might have felt in Germany, during the 1930's and forties. Hermione's attempt to save her parents from the hands of evil give us another view in this world which almost mirrors us in terms of what these people go through to wipe this evil horror.<br /><br />The deathly Hollows may be a boring film for those unfamiliar with the book, but for the readers of this tale it is the most faithfully done adaptation. Sure, the film does not succeed on a film lover's point of view, but one must remember any disappointment felt with this film will evaporate with the menacing, blood spilling second part.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942609,B004WMKSH2, A1C58YXM2A30CY,5.0, Dark Wizards! ** minor spoilers **,"Part I of the Deathly Hallows is faithful to the book for the most part.  Although a few things were cut out (such as the evil werewolf Greyback with the Snatchers or cutting out the Harry/Lupin fight in favor of a cute tent dancing scene with Hermione) the overall spirit of the film was faithful to the book.<br /><br />Director David Yates I feel did not make a great film with Order of the Phoenix but clearly redeemed himself in my eyes with this film.<br /><br />The film felt rushed at first. In the book there was more build-up with Uncle Vernon.  On the other hand, Harry's contemplation of the little stairway closet he used to live in, you can almost hear him say ""Wow, I've come a long way.""<br /><br />And indeed he has.  He wants no one to be hurt or injured and would rather go off on his trek on his own.  But Ron and Hermione will have none of it. and go Disapparating all over the English countryside with the Death Eaters hot on his tail.<br /><br />Several scenes they got right:  Ron's anger and jealousy with Harry and Hermione.  The Patronus doe to the lake where the sword of Gryffindor is laid.  The snake attack at Bagshot's place.<br /><br />And most amazingly, the great animation of the Three Brothers tale, as told by Hermione (and interrupted by Ron a couple times)!<br /><br />Nitpicking Follows!<br /><br />Several things I would have liked to have seen:  More of the elf Kreecher and his explanation of Regulus Black's switching of the Horcrux at the lake introduced in the previous film.  And in the book, Harry's disguised self at the Ministry of Magic enabled him to free many people from the dungeons of the Ministry but that didn't happen here.  And more of the radio -- there was a lot more going on with the radio broadcasts {Potter Watch}, like a Radio Free Wizard or something!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />I can see a person not having read the book might have some trouble with parts of the screenplay.  Reading the book clearly helps in filling in the gaps.  The snappy dialogue and the deep emotional investment by the audience is wrenching.  But the occasional humor (the tent scene) was cute.  And the soundtrack by the London Symphony Orchestra was superb.<br /><br />It's going to be a long wait to this summer!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942618,B004WMKSH2, A1VABWDOUQLULZ,4.0, Well done...,"While I thought the production team did a great job with the film, I think it's a perfect example of ""if you haven't read the book, it won't make much sense.""  At this point, why would anyone see a Potter film without having read the books?  It boggles the mind.  That said, this review is written toward those who know the story, proper.<br /><br />The direction was good, as was most of the writing.  Rupurt Grint was ever on pointe as Ron, and Radcliffe has without question grown his skills as Boy Who.  Watson finally acted, and without total reliance on eyebrows!  She was actually impressive in this film.  Maybe she has an acting career ahead, yet. The adult cast stepped it up in this installment, as well.  Billowy-cloaked Snape is a thing to behold, as is a broken Lucius Malfoy.  I was happy to see Carter act as if she wanted to be there, which finally brought Bellatrix alive for me.  Newcomer Rhys Ifans was wonderful.  In short, every actor delivered a standout performance.  Very impressive, in that regard.  The creatively layered reunion of the entire cast was fantastic.  That excitement alone boosts anticipation of the next film.<br /><br />I appreciate that this film was split, in order to do the story justice, as well it should have been.  I can't help but think that all of the action and luster is in the second half, which leaves this lead-up a bit diminished.  In the story proper, this portion should be the emotional setup for what is to come, and in that regard I felt it lacked.  The darkness, thus direness, of the Wizarding world was made evident from the opening scene.  This is no children's film.  Know that the racy scenes and violence reveal this throughout.  Still, even with poignant smatterings of grief and terror, the emotional depth did not sustain.  I would have gladly sat through a four-hour film if longevity would have maintained the momentum better.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />I was a bit bereft of the treatment of Hedwig's demise.  As the film left it, her absence was the only real indicator that she was dead.  The lack of Harry's processing of that was equally unrealistic and unclear. More acknowledgement was given to the loss of Dobby, who had far less face time in the films than she did.  Though Hagrid was Harry's first real friend in the Wizarding world, Hedwig was his first real emotional connection in his life.  I didn't think it canon that this bond wouldn't have been more acknowledged at her death.<br /><br />Though the camping scenes didn't make for riveting action (the same can be said of the book), the character development during those weeks was long overdue.  We saw a darkness in Ron prior unrevealed, a depth to Hermione and Harry's relationship had only been hinted at prior, and a long-needed resourcefulness in Harry was finally tapped.  I agree with criticism that pace slowed tremendously during those scenes, but what we learned about the trio in that stillness was necessary.  In truth, it was better delivered in the film than in the book, albeit out of sequence in the film.<br /><br />Insight into what was happening at Hogwart's bore showing.  Early in the film, the impression is finally given that this is not just Harry's fight, but is that of the entire Wizarding world.  But by focusing primarily on the trio's lives and not how others contributed to the effort--and they were--much of that communal sense of obligation, thus sacrifice, is lost.<br /><br />Explanations of the Hallows was rushed at best.  If you didn't understand them or how they and their lineage relate to Harry's plight, I'm afraid rewinding won't be much help.  That said, if you know their far-reaching relevance from the book, the animated sequence telling their story was well-done, albeit quickly so.<br /><br />The cheesiest effect in the film was Ron's greatest fears come to life, seeing Harry and Hermione passionately locked together.  It looked like a 2D paste job against a rolling CGI effect.  I was so unamused by the effect that I didn't connect with what a riveting and psychological test it was for Ron.<br /><br />The best scene in the film was Harry silently summoning Hermione to dance.  Without being romantic or sentimental it was profound, showing how Harry has matured into awareness of and reaction to the emotional states of others.  This is the trait that sets Harry apart from Voldemort more than any other, and this scene subtly conveyed his finesse in interpersonal observation and reaction.<br /><br />Several vaguely explained plot items troubled me, most of which were also problematic in the previous films.  Dobby showing up with no explanation is a major oversight that did not need to be.  The Missing Mirror, which should have been introduced way back at The Order of the Phoenix and wasn't now shows up with no explanation at all.  This lack negates how instrumental it is in the escape from Malfoy Manner, and diminishes the grief that Harry still processes from Sirius', and most recently Dumbledore's death.  Along that line, the need for the horcruxes is revealed, though the significance of the items precious to each of the Houses at Hogwart's is not.  It will be interesting to see how they jam learning about them AND finding each of them into the remaining installment",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942619,B004WMKSH2, A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,5.0, A stellar adaptation of HP and the Deathly Hallows,"Given that the concluding novel in the Harry Potter series covers so much in terms of plot and characterization, it is fitting that the movie was divided into two parts. I was quite wary about this latest installment in the HP franchise after some of the liberties taken with HP and the Half-Blood Prince (though I still loved it). I feel that HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is one of the most (if not, the most) faithful adaptation of a HP novel to be brought to the silver screen. There is a perfect synergy of all the elements that made me fall in love with the story of HP as written in the books - great characterization made possible by credible and amazing acting; gorgeous cinematography; a score that perfectly captures the angst, tension, and drama of the unfolding story; and special effects that awe without overwhelming the audience or detract from the story.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to mention and I feel is important is that this particular installment really does require prior knowledge of the Harry Potter novels. This movie takes it for granted that viewers will be able to fill in the blanks, like why does Hermione have to perform a spell on her parents which erases her existence from their memories? Throughout the movie, little snippets of Potter lore are sprinkled about which will delight any devoted fan but might confound and frustrate any newcomer to the series (which is why I would recommend starting from the first movie and working one's way through the series, in order). To really understand all that is going on, and the significance of certain things unfolding during the movie, I would recommend reading the book (to be able to see a particular scene and think, ""That's exactly how I imagined it would happen!"" or ""Ahh, so that's the significance of the ..."" was an enriching and immensely satisfying experience for me).<br /><br />I am not going to rehash the plot in detail - basically, this movie takes off some time after HP and the Half-Blood Prince ended. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) sends the Dursleys off to a safe spot as he prepares to go on his quest for the remaining Horcruxes which hold parts of Voldemort's soul. He is joined by best pals Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint). Part One of Deathly Hallows traces the trio's journey and sense of aimlessness (for they know not where the remaining horcruxes are); tension and strife between Ron and Harry; Hermione's sadnesss at losing Ron briefly; the constant pressure of being on the run; and perhaps most significantly, discovering that each of them truly have a purpose, that it is together and not individually that they are able to gain advantage over the Dark Lord. The actors who play the leads have truly come into their own and it is just amazing to see these young actors mature into and inhabit each of their roles with credibility and assurance, playing their characters with great depth. It is even more amazing given that they have been playing these roles for more than a decade, yet never do they show that they are tiring of their roles or just doing it for the money - there's real passion here.<br /><br />My only grouse is that Snape (Alan Rickman) does not get much screen time, but I'm sure that will be redressed in Part Two where he plays a more significant role. Helena Bonham-Carter was a hoot to watch as usual, playing the maniacal role of Bellatrix Lestrange with a fervor unmatched by any screen villainess in recent time (at least in my opinion). Ralph Fiennes portrays the Dark Lord with a credible sense of evil and malignancy, though his appearances in this installment are mainly via flashbacks and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's thoughts.<br /><br />Three things that caught my interest (well, many things actually, but these three were unique): The dramatization of the tale of the three brothers, i.e. the Peverell brothers was done via animation, and it is gloriously done, with understatement yet is effective in conveying to the viewer the significance of this tale to Harry's quest. Another was the controversial scene between Harry and Hermione (spoiler ahead!) - Hermione and Harry are shown in an intimate embrace during a confrontation with the Dark Lord's soul and Ron who has been beseeched with doubts regarding their relationship flounders whilst the clock is ticking. This scene was tastefully done, and not explicit at all (except for kissing), so the PG-13 rating is safe! Finally, the scenes of persecution against the Mud-Bloods were so well-done and captured the hysteria that was so reminiscent of another time in the past, i.e. Nazi Germany during WW II.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this is a great set-up to the final installment in the HP series, and will especially please ardent fans of the novels. There is a perfect blend of drama, tension, bleakness, and even humor. Recommended!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942620,B004WMKSH2, A18G7GG53G2X8A,4.0, It's the Beginning of the End,"The decision to split the final of J.K. Rowling's novels into two films was a wise one, for it allows for the inclusion of crucial details that simply couldn't be cut for the sake of time and pacing. This first installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the most faithful adaptation since the original Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It's also just like all the previous films in that it's spectacular entertainment - provided you don't mind the shadowy, deeply emotional, almost funereal direction the stories have been going in. The depth of character is amazing, in all likelihood because of the film's overwhelming seriousness. The plot is engaging, a mixture of a road film, a scavenger hunt, and a revenge fable. It balances it's solemnity with a healthy dose of magic and, in a few very appropriate places, humor. It's also the first film in the series to end with a cliffhanger, always a welcome addition.<br /><br />Being faithful, of course, does have its drawbacks. The film is not only dependent on the viewer's knowledge of the previous installments, but also on the viewer's willingness to listen. Many, many important things are said by many, many people, and if you're not going to pay attention, you might as well see something else. Fortunately, just about everything is explained at one point or another; this is usually thanks to Hermione Granger, who after seven years is no less of a bookworm. We also have numerous scenes of the three leads piecing things together from little more than sheer speculation, and this is just as it has been since the very first film. What they will discover in Part 2 remains to be seen, but you can rest assured that some of what they thought about certain things will turn out to be incorrect.<br /><br />Part 1 begins exactly where Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince left off. With the magical world in chaos following the untimely death of Albus Dumbledore and a hostile takeover by Lord Volemort and his loathsome cronies, our heroes are forced to make drastic changes. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), now the most wanted wizard in the world, ships his aunt, uncle, and cousin off to a safe location. At Harry's side are his two best friends, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). So too are members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), and even Hogwarts gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). It will be hard to keep Harry's location a secret from the snake-faced Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), since it seems he can easily be traced.<br /><br />A series of terrible events force Harry, Hermione, and Ron to go on the run; they magically transport themselves from one isolated location to another, taking refuge in a special tent that, like Dr. Who's telephone booth, holds more space than its outer dimensions suggest. Their mission: Seek and destroy magical objects called Horcruxes, all of which contain a small piece of Voldemort's soul. Harry thought he had found one at the end of the previous film, but that item - a locket - turned out to be a fake. Finding the real locket will involve an interrogation of a cranky house elf named Kreacher (voiced by Simon McBurney), the kidnapping of a shady wizard named Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden), and a carefully planned break-in into the Ministry of Magic, where, in disguise, our three friends will run into their old nemesis, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton).<br /><br />These and other events are carefully crafted, but they're also expected. Not so expected is the ways in which Harry, Hermione, and Ron are developed. The world as they knew it is gone - no more Quiddich games, no more visits to Hogsmeade, no more classes at Hogwarts. They've abandoned their former lives. In short, they've grown up. Yes, but why did they have grow up in this particular way? Why are Hermione and Ron following Harry when it's obvious he has nothing to go on apart from memories of vague conversations with Dumbledore? Was Dumbledore the great wizard Harry thought him to be, or were there chapters of his life he intentionally never revealed? Our three friends are lost, confused, and weary, stuck on a quest for objects that could literally be anywhere. These include the fabled Deathly Hallows, three magical items symbolized as a line within a circle within a triangle.<br /><br />The Harry Potter films have gone from wonderfully whimsical to delightfully dark to terribly tragic. We've marveled at their heroes, shuddered at their villains, and mourned at the loss of beloved figures. They've ignited our imaginations and beckoned us to follow along with them. Before, I've taken the approach of the giddy fanboy, brimming with excitement and anticipation. In the case of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, I take an approach of resignation and elegy. It's the beginning of the end. I always knew it was coming, but even after the passage of nine years - ten when Part 2 is released next summer - it still feels as if it's coming too soon. This new movie is wonderful, but I will always remember with longing the first time I saw three fresh-faced eleven year olds going on their first magical adventure.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942627,B004WMKSH2, A3MHGA6BJJ7P27,5.0, THE FIX FOR VIDEO ON DEMAND DARK SCREENS,"I rented HARRY POTTER last night (Sunday, first weekend of availablity, so very heavy useage.) I watched the movie LATE, about 3am on the east coast, so I had none of the problems when overuse will lock up the signal. (I had the film streaming into my one year old laptop from a wifi hooked into a high speed phone line modem. From the laptop, I ran a hookup to a 32"" LCD TV.) People worried about lockup of the picture during high demand times,  might try to download the film instead of streaming it, at a time when you KNOW the peak use is down. AS FOR THE DARK SCREEN, i encountered that the first time I rented a video on demand. I had bought INCEPTION from AMAZON, and got a free rental of the film. COOL! SO, i started the film, and my screen was mostly just...DARK. I could hear the opening music, but nearly no picture. I tried to fix it on the LCD TV, but that didnt help. THE FIX FOR A DARK SCREEN. IF you look at the top of your laptop/computer (I'm running windows 7) you will notice TOOLS. Click on, and you will notice COMPATABILITY VIEW on the list of options.  CLICK ON COMPATIBILITY VIEW. This lightened up the picture, to normal viewing. NOW, as for pixelation. I believe that's an artifact of the limits of transmission. When you have a ""DARK"" movie, it can be annoying, tho I only ""noticed"" the problem at first. Your eyes or brain will adjust. I dont have the option to rent videos, because my small city has NO VIDEO STORES, except for grocery store video kiosks. Let's be realistic. If you want HI DEF/ blu-ray reception, you cant get that via Video on demand. I dont think the servers, or the modems, or even maybe the computer processors, have the power...YET. This is new technology for the most part. WE ALL NEED TO GET USED TO WATCHING FILMS LIKE THIS, cos it IS the future. Just be patient with yourself, and AMAZON, until we all figure out how to get things to work. If you get a black/dark screen, and the FIX VIA ""TOOLS"" at the top of the page, for COMPATABILITY VIEW doesnt work, try to pull your BRIGHTNESS CONTROLL all the way to LIGHT. I think this works via the computer, and the TV as well. I SUGGEST YOU WATCH THE COMING ATTRACTION for the POTTER film, and get this bug ironed out then, if you expect a problem. If the COMING ATTRACTION doesnt look correct, and you dont want to chance it, or your have an older system with a slow processor, simply dont rent the film over the internet.<br /><br />Now, as for the HARRY POTTER FILM ""DEATHLY HALLOWS PT 1."" I had no problem with the split. HEY, i lived thru LORD OF THE RINGS getting split in ways that drove me up a wall. BUT who is going to watch a 5 hour version of Deathly Hallows, and who wants to see the last book get over edited? The last book is too important. ALSO, ""Harry Potter"" isnt a kid anymore. The films have been dark, since the death at the tournement. I think that was the first REAL death. POTTER 7 has an ORWELL's 1984 vibe, with the way the ministry of Magic was taken over. That was forshadowed when Hogwarts was taken over. ALSO, the 10-12 year olds that liked the first movie/book, are older now. HARRY and company are literally warriors now. They can only expect a warrior's life. AND, we have seen this building for some time in the films. THIS IS A DARK FILM, and not just with the pallet of colors. Its about an orphan, its about evil taking over the world, its about oppression of Moggles (read: jews, blacks, the poor, etc). If your kid is 10 years old, NO WAY is this film for them. YOUNGER KIDS should be allowed to watch the first 3 films, UNTIL THEY GROW UP A BIT.  Unlike the LOTR, this is a very episodic series, that doesnt really depend on the previous book for the plot, UNTIL you reach films #3 or #4. IF this film were NOT dark, it would not have the depth of emotion. THIS IS HARRY POTTER AT WAR, troup movements, living in tents, visiting bombed out buildings and graves, its DARK STUFF for youngsters. HEY...rent MEGAMIND if you want ""LIGHT""entertainment. WELL, lets get ready for JULY, and the LAST FILM, then we can put our elm wands away, and wait for the next BIG THING. (hopefully the Hobbit?)",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

So rather than lecture on about how this is one of the best in the series (and it really is) I would like to address some of the 1 and 2 star reviews. I find it sad that people's ignorance and stupidity has to diminish the rating of this fabulous movie. Yes I know the ratings on Amazon really don't matter, but I really bothers me.<br /><br />So to the reviewer that gave the movie 2 stars for not completing the Dobby's Burial scene and explaining Harry's choice between the Horocrux's and the Hallow's, you might like to know that is only Part 1. There is a freaking reason why they split the movie into 2 parts, that is because there were things that could not be pushed into a single film. Ever think they might address that in Part 2?<br /><br />And to that person who rated the movie 1 star because he claimed he couldn't review the movie because he hadn't watched it yet, then why did you write that in the form of a review with 1 star?<br /><br />Finally, to the person who states that it was a failure because he is a huge fan and it didn't meet his expectations, so he was going to leave the Harry Potter series, I wouldn't call that being such a huge fan.<br /><br />I could go on and on and on, but I'll stop there.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

After the Half-Blood Prince, I wasn't exactly thrilled.  But this film not only advances the roles of the existing cast, but brings back certain roles and makes the movie that much better.  Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint just blew me away with this installment.  All three of them came back with an edgier attitude and added more maturity to their characters.  I enjoyed seeing all three grow from Sorceror's Stone to the final film. The obvious gradual improvment makes this series perhaps one of the best if not the best film in history in terms of novel-based films.

The scene of Hermione wiping her parents memories and leaving home had me in tears in just the first few minutes of the movie. And then just a few minutes later, the death of Hedwig during the flight from Privet Drive brought me to tears again.<br />This movie included all the important parts of the book while leaving out some of the parts that dragged on a little too long (the many nights on the run in the countryside of England) And the ending of Part I, where Harry, Ron and Hermione are caught by the Snatchers left me breathless with anticipation for Part II.<br />Any Harry Potter that has not yet seen this movie (is that even possible?) should definitely get the video and watch it before Part II arrives in the theatres in July of 2011.

4942633,B004WMKSH2, A39W3263A9HCMN,5.0, Harry Potter and the much needed gritty do-over,"I'm one of the many who absolutely loved the last film, The Half Blood Prince. IMO, it's a long book, but David Yates did what he could and gave us a fairly solid adaptation. And so it goes, we're at the end of the movie series. It's not a pleasant feeling knowing that we're at the end, but it's been a hell of a ride! And dare I say it, Hallows part one is definitely the best film since Goblet of Fire!<br /><br />Of course, there was much controversy upon the news of the finale being split in two, and I'll admit I was one of the ""TWO movies? [...] that"" crowd, but after doing some thinking, I realized it's a long book and so much important stuff happens, so after all, it's only reasonable. And I waited. And waited. And then, the showtimes for opening night got released, and I found that it was playing in the new Canadian projection system AVX, with wall to wall screen, rocker seats and crystal clear image and sound. So I went after work, a week early too, to go get my ticket, and awaited opening day.<br /><br />Needless to say, this movie did not disappoint.<br /><br />I was surprised at the amount of material that was covered. It was more of 75% of the book in a 146-Minute movie, and so I was pleased. This movie is also startlingly different from the other ones too. As expected, and shown in the books, the dark level rose with every book, and as seen in the trailers, this would be the darkest and grittiest. And my friends, it is just that, and thankfully so too. This basically strips away the glossiness of the others and gives us a rough, gritty, raw, disturbing and depressing feel/visual palette.<br /><br />Also, I normally detest shaky camera, as it looks ridiculous, gives me a headache and looks like someone with Parkinson's shot it. But here, it was used in the best way possible!!!! It actually added to the raw feel of the film, and suited the movie's dark tones well too. I was actually floored at how well done the shaky camera was, and furthermore, just how well done the film was.<br /><br />In short, I walked out tickled pink and happy, because this is the Harry Potter I asked for, and I got. I am absolutely stoked for part two. Bravo, David Yates! Bravo!!!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942634,B004WMKSH2, A3J7G5B8DO94UH,5.0," A Give and Take, Mostly Take","Really fabulous movie. Its a shame we have to come back for Part 2 (and buy it, lol) but so far, judging from this movie its well worth it. Plus, for once the book readers and the only-movie watchers are semi-satisfied. That's sort of a guarantee. Things are missing, things are modified to make them ""cooler"" but it works.<br /><br />Hollywood has to change things like they intend to with the next movie and Snape's scene, but that so that the same feelings we felt from reading the book can be felt in a movie. You can't translate things exactly the same from book to screen and make people understand and believe and feel it.<br /><br />This movie is well worth the leap of faith.<br /><br />The kids are out of Hogwarts now, and while that could have backfired on them, it worked really well. Everything really worked really well. They are much more experienced actors and it shows. The trio in particular are completely fabulous in this one.<br /><br />I'll be buying this version, on blue-ray, merely because it was THAT good. I've been a fan of Harry Potter for roughly eleven years now, and I was not at all disappointed. Ended up watching this movie twice in theaters, which I have never done.<br /><br />The effects are not cheesy, even the ""shield"" or ""protection"" magics, and its pretty clear to anyone; it doesn't skip too many things that the ""only-movie watchers"" need to know. Did I have to explain a few things to the guy next to me that kept taking me away from the movie? Sure.

4942635,B004WMKSH2, A2YKADCJME4FSW,4.0, Harry and friends face inner demons.,"As the aggregation of six films, the first part of the final Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (whew), carries with it weighty expectations.  With each installment the stakes have been raised to the point where the final film will have awfully high hurdles to clear.  Besides, after making one's way through what's likely around fifteen hours of film already, you're likely going to want a massive payoff.  In the case of HP 7.5, it may be too early to decide whether the concluding movie delivers on the ever growing anticipation for the final conflict between good and evil, but I can confidently state that the film ingeniously ups the ante not by making Potter and his gang face off against even more powerful magicians, but by making our heroes grapple with their own interior fears, jealousies and existential nightmares.<br /><br />Just as the final film in the series has been cleaved in two, we might look at HP 7.5 as a film divided.  The first half takes the form of an espionage thriller, pitting Voldermort against the Order of the Phoenix.  Realizing that Harry might be the only person capable of defeating Voldemort, the Order of the Phoenix creates several Harry decoys in hopes of redirecting any assassination attempts away from the real Harry.  Their ruse is almost immediately discovered when several Death Eaters intercept the faux-Harries (and the real one) in mid-air, leading to an impressive chase scene across the London skyline and English countryside.  This action sequence is perhaps only bested by Harry, Ron and Hermione's infiltration of the Ministry of Magic, which has been recently co-opted by the Death Eaters, to retrieve a magic locket.  These set pieces give the audience exactly what they want from their blockbusters: big adventure and even bigger special effects.  Unlike the average blockbuster, which usually globs a bunch of CGI on the screen like a two year old with finger paints, HP 7.5's action is carefully crafted mixture of excruciating suspense and daring deeds.<br /><br />About halfway through the film, however, HP 7.5 makes a strange turn into what seems like a different film.  After recovering the magic locket from the Ministry of Magic, Harry and company flee to the English countryside in order to decide how to dispose of this mystical object.  The locket, we learned from the last installment, is a horcrux, or an object that houses part of Voldemort's soul and grants him eternal life, until they're all destroyed, that is.  The horcrux locket shares many of the same qualities as the ring in Tolkein's Lord of the Rings saga.  It cannot be destroyed by except under special circumstances and brings out the worst in whoever happens to bear the locket at any given time.  Naturally, the three take turns with the evil artifact, but this precaution still does not prevent the inanimate agitator from wreaking havoc on their interpersonal relationships.  Ron is the first affected by the heavy burden of the locket, accusing Harry and Hermione of carrying on an illicit affair and eventually abandoning their expedition.<br /><br />Of course, Ron isn't entirely wrong in his accusations.  It is difficult not to notice a simmering mutual attraction between Harry and Hermione.  After Ron leaves, the two of them share a dance to a Nick Cave song (a lesser director would have brought in the overused ""Hallelujah,"" and still an even lesser director would have used the Rufus Wainright cover), a surprisingly tender moment that is at first difficult to read.  By establishing that Ron's insecurities are more than just paranoia, the film utilizes the locket's magic to uncover real depth to its characters.  The majority of the second half follows the characters as they attempt to discover how to destroy the horcrux, all the while moving from one gorgeous British landscape to the next.  This extended camping trip seems somewhat lugubrious compared to the tightly constructed first half, and, as they stumble from one clue to the next Harry and Hermione seem at a loss as to what direction to take and where to go.  This is their ""Jesus in the Wilderness"" moment where the characters begin to question the efficacy of what they are doing.  We might also situate this stretch of the film within the innocence to experience themes that Rowlings has been working with since the first book.<br /><br />If we view the Harry Potter saga as a story about a boy growing up and learning more about himself and the world as he progresses through an educational system, then, like anyone who has graduated from high school or college, we must contend with the question of what this individual will do once he is freed from the helpful constraints of schooling, where the next step forward is always placed right in front of you.  Every schoolchild dreams of the freedom of adulthood, but few actually know what to do with themselves immediately after escaping the bonds of education (tellingly, Hogwarts is absent this time around).  Everyone has his or her moment in the wilderness.  This reading of HP 7.5 is bolstered by the strange, esoteric logic of the quest.  The way that Harry and Hermione stumble from one clue to the next signifies the sometimes directionless nature of adulthood.<br /><br />What's particularly ingenious about HP 7.5 is that it overlays adult existentialist questions over what is ostensibly a ""children's film.""  It is not, however, the first kid's film of 2010 to do this.  Toy Story 3 similarly grappled with questions of life's purpose and death's eventuality.  What makes these films ""dark"" has nothing to do with violence or obscenities (although the trash dump in Toy Story 3 was rather frightening), but rather with their ability to imbue films made for a broad audience with themes that most of us would rather not think about on our day out with the relatives.  There are other family films that are more violent and contain more sexual innuendoes, but these elements just as often make the films more juvenile as they make them more adult (filmmakers and fanboys take note).  HP 7.5 and TS 3 show us that big movies are capable of tackling big questions.<br /><br />HP 7.5 strides into theaters with the confidence only millions of ready made fans can muster.  It decides, with great effect, to slow the plot down just when most films would be hustling to throw everything they have at the audience.  It also includes a gorgeous animated sequence that incorporates fairy tales into the repertoire of Rowling's collage of influences.  If there is one thing that holds the film back, it is its role as prelude to the big finale.  It is difficult for a film without an ending to fully satisfy, especially when we know that part two is just a few months away.

When the Series Ends,"Sad days lay ahead now that the ""Harry Potter"" saga is coming to an end.<br /><br />There isn't anything else like it now (""Twilight""? Please!) and it seems doubtful anything else will be able to match it for some time to come. Author JK Rowling created a series of highly imaginative books introducing us to a bevy of unusual, interesting characters we have lived with for a long time, so long they seem like friends/ When the enormous success of the first few books led to the inevitable films, many die-hard fans were worried. Thankfully, the first two films were adequate, if uninspired. Beginning with the third film, the series takes on a darker personality, to match the tone of the books, and allowed a handful of more creative directors to create a movie series worthy of the imagination the books helped us conjure.<br /><br />Warner Bros. made the right decision to tell the story of the ""Deathly Hallows"" in two films. This frees Steve Kloves, the screenwriter of the entire series, and David Yates, the director of the last four films in the series, to tell as much of the story as humanly possible. Given ""Part 1"" runs close to 3 hours, they are covering a lot of the book. This is a refreshing change of pace as each of the previous film adaptations pared down the material, sacrificing characters, subplots, relationships.<br /><br />And much like the book, ""Part 1"" basically sets up ""Part 2"". It is basically an introduction to the conclusion, the set-up for the big finale, the epic battle between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. Some may feel there is too much exposition. I don't. It works and the filmmaking is top notch creating a thrilling chapter in the series.<br /><br />Picking up at what would be the beginning of Potter's final year at Hogwarts, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) wait anxiously for their friends in the Order of the Phoenix. Soon everyone assembles at Harry's Muggle home and an elaborate plan is put in place to move Harry to a secure location and keep him out of the hands of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). But Voldemort and his minions are hot on their path. Harry, Hermione and Ron quickly decide to flee to a secret place in the forest and hide out. They spend every moment trying to figure out how to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes. Once these powerful mementos of Tom Riddle's life are gone, they believe He Who Must Not Be Named will be vulnerable and they stand a chance to defeat the enemy. But Voldemort is looking for some very different items, the Deathly Hallows, items he believes will help him defeat that pesky Potter.<br /><br />Yates and Kloves have done a remarkable job of building the story towards this inevitable dark climax. As the stakes rise, the danger increases matching the dark tone of the narrative. Given this series was originally written with pre-teens in mind, it is nice to see the filmmakers have not shied away from depicting these dark moments.<br /><br />Throughout the series, the three leads have grown both physically and as actors. Daniel Radcliffe creates a viable persona for Harry, giving him a human quality, real feelings, making us care and root for him. When his friends face danger on his behalf, we can see the pain on his face as he realizes the sacrifices others are making for him. Emma Watson continues to give Hermione a real depth. She has always been the smart one, the one who excels in her studies, and the one her friends turn to for a quick spell or an answer to a puzzle. But as she has grown into a young lady, threads of confusion have woven into her performance; she doesn't understand the power she holds over boys, but is only too willing to use this power when necessary. Rupert Grint has grown most of all. In the early days, his google eyes and incessant mugging made it almost impossible to watch him. Now, he is able to channel the real feelings and distractions any teenager might feel which make him seem more real and more interesting.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing about ""Part 1"" is something dictated by the book, so I am not sure the film should be faulted. The best thing about this series is the rich wealth of acting talent appearing in supporting roles as various wizards, witches and villains. Alan Rickman, the best throughout, plays the sly, sneaky and snarky Professor Severus Snape. It is great fun to watch him play the role, tailor-made for his talents, with such relish. Maggie Smith is very good as Professor McGonagall, the head of Harry's house and a defacto mother for the young wizard. Robbie Coltrane, Timothy Spall, Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson, Jim Broadbent, Miranda Richardson, Brendan Gleeson, Richard Harris, Imelda Staunton, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths and Michael Gambon, to name a very few, have all taken on roles and all have been memorable.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes returns as Lord Voldemort, the ultimate bad guy. He Who Must Not Be Named is ready to battle the young wizard, his nemesis for all of these years. He is ready to take over the wizarding world, his power is growing, and he now has control of the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts. Muggles should be very afraid.<br /><br />But in ""Part 1"", a significant portion of the film involves the three young friends hiding out in the forest, trying to figure things out. This involves a lot of talking and some arguing. Most of all, these moments keep us away from most of the British actors who lend their talents to and provide some of the most memorable moments in the series. While Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have all grown as actors, it is still far more interesting to watch them interact with a virtual who's-who of British cinema. Thankfully, many of these actors should play a more pivotal role in ""Part 2"".<br /><br />The ""Harry Potter"" franchise has been and will continue to be so lucrative for all involved it makes sense Warner Bros. has always been extremely careful with each film, creating one great film after another. ""Part 1"" is no exception and I think it may be one of the most beautiful in the series. From the moment we enter the wizarding world, everything looks real, beautiful and wonderful. The ability to make this world appear so real, as it basically sits on top of London, is no small feat. The film opens with an exciting chase, our attention focused on Harry as he rides in Hagrid's sidecar. The motorcycle roars through London traffic and at one point drives upside down in a tunnel. The motorcycle speeds through traffic and helps illustrate the danger our hero faces as he straddles these two worlds. The previously mentioned scenes of the trio in the forest and other natural locales are also beautiful, reflecting the harsh reality of a British winter. When the action moves to the Ministry of Magic, you feel as though your are entering the halls of a hallowed institution.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the Tale of the Deathly Hallows. Late in the film, Hermione finally has a moment to recount the story for Harry's benefit. As she narrates the fable, it is illustrated for us using a series of dark shadows, as though puppets are recreating the tale. This technique helps to give the story a children's book quality; the characters might be hand shadows or paper cutouts moving across a sepia background. It is a nice touch to further reinforce the fable nature of the story, a fable both Hermione and Ron heard as children. It almost feels as though we are watching the story unfold through Potter's eyes.<br /><br />The ""Harry Potter"" films are magical and as the series comes to a close, everyone has such high expectation for the last two films. If these expectations aren't met, they will feel disappointed. Originally, ""Part 1"" was going to be released in 3-D, which was exciting news; using this technique promised to bring the world in these films to life. But then Warner Bros. changed their plans and I learned these films weren't actually made in 3-D. They were going to retrofit the second to last film, the same technique used to help make ""Clash of the Titans"" the piece of crap it is. Thank goodness they changed their mind. ""Clash"" looks terrible, as though the film was made in the 50s using the original 3-D technology. The newest ""Chronicles of Narnia"" is also retrofitted and looks it. I have to wonder why they continue to do this and also why didn't they just make the film in 3-D to begin with? It boggles my mind to think they might have subjected ""Part 1"" to this process, creating a sub par entry in the series. As the second to last entry in the series, an awful experience would be a huge let down to the loyal fans and would leave a bad taste in their mouth.<br /><br />Hopefully, this common sense will prevail for ""Part 2"" as well.<br /><br />""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is a necessary step to ""Part 2"". It isn't the most memorable entry in the series, but it is very good. And my expectations for ""Part 2"" are very high.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942637,B004WMKSH2, A3T0OTH5072YRE,4.0, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1,"I've read all the books, seen all the movies (to date) and this one was good but definitely not the best of them.  I do have to confess that its been awhile since I read the book, but I was scratching my head through part of this movie trying to figure out where some of the scenes came from.  Whether this is from faulty memory or drastic changes from the book, I'm not quite sure.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar with the Harry Potter series, they should be read/watched in sequence without skipping around.  To do otherwise is to miss out on a lot of important plot details.  Its also important to note that the books have vastly more detail and help explain some things the movies do not so I recommend reading the books to help fill some of these holes in the movies.<br /><br />Harry Potter had lived with his aunt and uncle and their spoiled son when one day he discovers he is a wizard and can attend the magical school of Hogwarts.  Harry has a sad past though, his parents were killed by an evil wizard and throughout the books, that wizard keeps trying to come back and kill Harry.  This wizard, Voldemort, has finally regained power and taken over the world.  Harry, and his two friends Hermione and Ron set out to find the last of the Horcruxes, talismen that hold a part of Voldemort's soul and are the key to killing him once and for all.  Their journey is not easy, and they are pursued at every step, betrayed, and even injured.  In addition to this, they have to cope with their feelings for each other and maintain their friendship.<br /><br />Since it only covers half of the book, this movie largely focuses on Harry and the gang trying to find some of the horcruxes without going into any real battle.  There are a couple squirmishes so fighting is not totally ruled out in this movie.  The fighting can be brutal and may scare some younger viewers.  Some of the characters are just plain creepy as well.  Bellatrix especially, she gives me shivers.<br /><br />Ron really took a shining role in this movie.  He was witty and showed a wide range of emotion.  Hermione of course was her perfect self, but even she was allowed to fly off the handle a bit.  Harry was stoic and set upon his task, but I do think they could have given him a few more bits of happiness in the movie than they did.  Comic relief was far and few between in this dark movie.  Which is not necessarily bad, but could make the movie a bit heavy for some viewers.  The rest of the characters were all played well and very believable.  Its nice that they really tried to find the perfect person for each part and it makes the movie that much more relatable to the books.<br /><br />My only complaints with the movie are that some of the scenes were longer than necessary.  I realize character development is important, but after awhile, watching them trudge around with their tent got a little boring and I would have liked to see the pace pick up a bit or even some of those scenes cut.  Yes, the book may have had that as well, but movie going is a very different animal than book reading, and some things should be changed to reflect that.  In addition, I was also a bit disappointed they cut out the devlopment of Kreacher in the movie when he played such a huge role in the book.  It seems to me they could have had more of that and less of tent trudging.<br /><br />For the more technical aspects of the movie, the special effects and cinematography were great.  Even better than the previous movies in my opinion. I especially loved the tree outside the Lovegood's home. The music is always wonderful and really fit with the tone of the movie.<br /><br />It was a wonderful movie though and mostly faithful to the book.  I would take a guess that any fan of Harry Potter will probably enjoy this movie.  Now I just have to wait for the much anticipated finale.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2010",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942638,B004WMKSH2, A2IZS9A6BMLUNN,5.0, Better the second time!,"I'm one of those who hasn't yet read this book. So far, I've been able to see the movie and then read the book and that works for me - I don't want any visions of anything in my own head to ruin the movie for me. Reading through some of these reviews, maybe I should have read this book first.<br /><br />But having said that, I really love this movie. The first time I saw it, to be honest, I was quite bored with all the camping scenes and could have done with some more of the wedding, instead. I didn't realize that Bill was marrying Fleur from the tri-wizard cup until the second time I saw it. And there's a tiny bit of conversation that gives the impression that Bill's now a werewolf himself and learning things from Lupin, who's going to become a father soon, at least that's what seems to be implied. Would have loved more info here!<br /><br />Also, I had forgotten some things that happened in the 'Half Blood Prince' and watched it closely before seeing the 'Deathly Hallows' the second time. Three of the characters looked the same to me, so that was confusing and I'm not sure why Mr Malfoy was acting so scared and timid around Voldemort when he'd always been so bold around him before. And I'm still holding out for Snape to turn out to be one of the good guys! And did we *really* lose Mad Eye? We didn't see him killed, maybe he's recuperating somewhere while we're all watching Harry and Hermione camping? No idea.<br /><br />The humor in this film is excellent, I didn't really think there would be much to laugh at in this installment. The scene with all the Harry's was hysterical, then George with the toothbrush stuck in his ear, that guy just has to stand there wearing that goofy expression and it's hilarious. Then comes the polyjuice potion. The guy playing Harry was absolutely perfect with his expressions and body movement, it cracked me up just seeing him turn and walk away.<br /><br />And the ultimate sign of a great movie is when the entire audience says 'ahhhhhhhhhh!!!' when it's over, everyone wants to see more!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942639,B004WMKSH2, AQJSMLYHE6GN4,4.0, The Best Yet...,"Fine, I confess; I didn't like the last Harry Potter book so much. It seemed very rushed, and the characters development just seemed to have stopping. For die-hard Potter fans, this movie DOES follow the book VERY well; but it also makes the characters more believable.<br /> For example, Ron is much more likeable in the movie. He's not perfect, but we can understand what Hermione sees in him. We get why he freaks out and why he's jealous of Harry. Hermione shines as a self-confidant, strong and smart gal more than ever. Harry is an understated character, but that works well. The casting is, as always, brilliant. Loved the casting especially of Bill and Mr. Lovegood.<br /> It's been a while since I read the book, but as far as I can tell, the movie left very little out, such as where Harry reads the encouraging graffiti at Godric's Hallow. Some scenes were added; Harry and Hermione's dance scene is great; I like how their relationship becomes closer, not quite romantic - we really feel how they're, for a time, the only person the other has. The Bill and Fleur wedding scene was altered; it's interrupted by a Death Eater Attack (which I found annoying). There was more action here than in the book; I don't remember the fight with Nagini the snake being so long; if you don't like snakes, don't watch that scene.<br /> Finally, another great thing about this movie is the landscape. I usually don't really notice the background in movies that much, but whoever was in charge of location was brilliant. Since the kids are apparating so often, they end up in completely different locations. From a snowy, sleepy town to the city to the beach, all the scenery is gorgeous.  I'll admit that, in the book, I felt lost without Hogwarts. This movie is VERY different from the others, but I actually liked it better for that. Because the characters and special effects were still brilliant, it just felt like going on a more grown-up, exciting adventure than before!<br />Love the movie, can't wait for the next, and hope this review helps!<br />PS I will totally buy the DVD, or at least rent it, so will try and give you an update on special features and so forth.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942640,B004WMKSH2, A319Y83RT0MRVR,5.0, a solid book adaptation that makes you want to see it again,"This movie was made of awesome.<br /><br />I haven't reread the book, as I've done previously with the films, so I wasn't in my nit-picking mood.<br /><br />Plus, the special effects looked fabulous. Both Dobby and Kreacher looked real and, although my brain knows that Nagiri isn't real, my eyes couldn't tell that.<br /><br />The trio are so much better actors now than they were in the previous six films - whatever advice or acting lessons they took paid off.<br /><br />Alan Rickman appears in the film not nearly enough but steals the show for the 2 milliseconds he is on screen.<br /><br />I thought that the storyline and the necessary revisions, as well as additions were handled well. I would see this movie again in theaters. Soon.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942646,B004WMKSH2, AX3WJZLFQQRCT,4.0, Best of the Bunch,"'The Deathly Hallows - pt 1"" surpassed ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" as my favourite Harry Potter movie.<br /><br />I know many did not like this movie due to lack of activity, but I disagree.  It's not just ""the camping movie"".  Sure it was a bit more understated, but I thought it also showed off better than the other movies how far Radcliffe, Grint and Watson had come as actors.<br /><br />Visually, the movie was stunning. The muted tones were nice. The locations were incredible. Let's face it, the animation for the tale of the Deathly Hallows was frickin' awesome. And yes, there was enough action (c'mon, that run through the forest from the Snatchers, filmed on a zipline was great in the theater) to not make the movie as boring as some people seem to think it was.  I loved the Ministry of Magic scene, though the Malfoy Manor scene seemed darker in print version.<br /><br />I'm not to gripe about some of the minor changes from book to screen - it happened with all of them. Get over it. I liked the tent scene w Harry and Hermione dancing. I think the song choice of Nick Cave's ""O Children"" was brilliant.<br /><br />Yes, except for the wedding at the Weasley's, there are not many folks in the movie who aren't Harry, Hermione and Ron. There are no Hogwarts crew, but it works.  It was meant to be a solitary (well, solitary x3) journey and it was.<br /><br />Still. the overall feeling of the movie was isolation, introspection and survival.  The director, location scout and screenwriter covered this nicely - and the actors did a great job of conveying it all.<br /><br />Nothing is resolved in this movie and I think that also irked people.....but the last few movies were like that as well.  Still, it now ranks as the best Harry Potter film in the series - at least for me.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

But I'd waited long enough already, so when Amazon offered a pre-release reservation, I ordered it.<br /><br />It may be discounted because this one did not do quite so well at the box office as the earlier films. It's dark, in both senses of the word. But then more people died in ""Half-Blood Prince"" than in this one. Still, the good guys are really up against it now, since the Death Eaters have taken over the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron & Hermione don't even try to go to Hogwarts for what would have been their senior year. They have far more important work: finding and destroying the rest of the Horcruxes that will strip Voldemort of his immortality and allow Harry to kill him. In effect, he is killing one part of Voldemort every time he destroys a horcrux. But it's not easy to find them, and not easy to destroy them.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows are three magical objects mentioned in ""Tales of Beedle the Bard,"" and I have a copy of that book. They include a wand which is more powerful than any other, the ""Elder Wand,"" which is suffused with dark magic. It is stolen from the former owner by killing him. There is a stone which can bring the dead back to life, but they are not happy being zombies and it goes badly. Finally, there is a cloak of invisibility. In the story, that's the only one that worked out well.<br /><br />Since this movie is just half of the last book, I wondered where they'd cut it off. I won't do a spoiler, but just say it was a good choice. However, I am now inspired to go back and read the book again, and get a better sense of what was changed and what was left out.

The special effects are impressive and the acting is right on the mark. Especially well-played is the part played by Helena Bonham Carter as she plays the demented and crazy wizard Bellatrix Lestrange. As a fantasy movie it is splendid; as an adaptation of the book it is quite good. Clocking in at 140 minutes it feels a bit short and I wish they could release an extended version of the film. Still and all a quite good film that I can gladly recommend. 4/5.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The quality of the dvd is excellent and I have no problems viewing it on my computer or my T.V.

4942677,B004WMKSH2, A3G5BUSPRTFYJ2,5.0, Amazon and Warner Video Technical Errors,"This review is a technical review for two Harry Potter movies:  1)'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1' (Amazon ASIN: B001UV4XHY) and 2) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2' (Amazon ASIN: B001UV4XIS).<br /><br />For Deathly Hallows Part 1, the product details on Amazon say that the Aspect Ratio of the movie is ""2.40:1"".  It is not.  According to the Internet Movie Database, the Aspect Ratio is 2.35:1.<br /><br />On backside of the DVD case for Part 1, it says, ""WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A 'LETTERBOX' WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING THE 'SCOPE' ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXHIBITION.  ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS.""  This is incorrect, thank goodness!<br /><br />The DVD is in fact an anamorphic DVD of the movie with an Aspect Ratio of 2.35:1.  It is not Letterboxed!  Warner Video's use of the words ""Enhanced for widescreen TVs"" is probably their way of saying ""anamorphic"".  They should just say, ""Anamorphic.""<br /><br />A true Letterboxed DVD of this movie would be a 1.33:1 image with a 2.35:1 widescreen image embedded and centered within it.  The movie would have black bars showing above and below.  It could be viewed on an older 1.33:1 TV without distortion.  It could also be viewed on a 1.77:1 widescreen TV in 1.33:1 (Pillarboxed) Mode without distortion.  Or is could be viewed on a 1.77:1 widescreen TV in Zoom Mode without horizontal or vertical distortion.  On a widescreen TV, in Full Mode, the image would be distorted and would appear stretched horizontally.<br /><br />Again, this DVD is in fact *not* Letterboxed.  If you watch this DVD on a 1.33:1 TV, the image is stretched vertically, hence it is anamorphic (which is good for those of us with widescreen TVs).  On a widescreen 1.77:1 TV, you need to watch the DVD in Full Mode to view the movie without distortion.  (Zoom Mode will not work well since the vertically stretched image will simply become bigger and remain vertically stretched.)<br /><br />For Deathly Hallows Part 2, the Product Details on Amazon say that the Aspect Ratio of the movie is ""1.77:1"".  It is not!  The Internet Movie Database tells us that the movie is 2.35:1.<br /><br />On backside of the DVD case for Part 2, it says, ""WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A 'LETTERBOX' WIDESCREEN FORMAT PRESERVING THE 'SCOPE' ASPECT RATIO OF ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXHIBITION.  ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS.""  Again, this is incorrect!<br /><br />The DVD is in fact an anamorphic DVD of the movie with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  It is not Letterboxed!<br /><br />So, the good news is the DVDs are fine.  Amazon is a bit confused about the correct Aspect Ratios and Warner Video needs to learn the correct definition of 'Letterboxed'.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942696,B004WMKSH2, A3B62CEEBAKM7M,5.0, A must for the Harry Potter fan,"This, along with part II, finishes off the Harry Potter story. Alone, it seems a bit of a bore, but combined with part II, it fits nicely into the story. You definitely need both parts of the Deathly Hallows if you want to find out how the film version turns out as they contain twists that turn the story on its head.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942697,B004WMKSH2, A124U4NFS0E2OI,4.0, Only one complaint,"This DVD is excellent, as are all of the Harry Potter Movies. The Only complaint I have<br />for this and Part Two of this feature is that it is not available in full screen as are<br />all of the other seven movies to this series. For everyone who has purchased the first<br />seven DVD's in full screen, it ruins the collection when the last ones are not available<br />in the same format. A lot of people will end up feeling ripped off, who don't like the<br />movies in wide screen presentation. I for one am tired of movie collections starting out<br />giving you a choice, and then ending with only one format available. The spiderman series<br />did the same thing. The first two were available in both formats, but the third was only<br />available in widescreen. Then to make matters worse, everytime this happens, it's always<br />the widescreen with the largest black bars, instead of the small ones, making the picture<br />even smaller. Even on a big screen TV it's like watching a movie through two slats in a<br />fence. You'd think if they were only going to offer one aspect ratio, that they would<br />compromise and use the format with the smallest black bars and largest picture. You'd<br />also think that if they're going to start a series of movies with a continuing story,<br />that all of the movies would be released in the same format. I Love the Harry Potter<br />movies from beginning to end, but I'm certainly not going to re purchase the entire<br />set just to get them in the same format, no matter how cheap the price. Once I've purchased<br />a show, I think that should be that. So to the manufacturers of these DVD's which have<br />numerous sequels, please finish what you start. I feel ripped off everytime you do this.<br />As for the movie, it was great. These stories were great from beginning to end. Great job<br />on bringing these stories to film. I highly reccommend all of the Harry Potter movies, but<br />only wish all eight were available in fullscreen.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942698,B004WMKSH2, A1J9S070L0MVWX,2.0, DVD watcher,"I love all of the Harry Potter books and movies. However, this is the worst one, mainly because it looks like most of it was filmed in the dark and it is very difficult to see the action going on through most of the film. You can still have dark overtones and still have a few lights on so you can see what's going on. Don't these directors review them before they say ""print""?  What's the point of filming a movie when it looks like it's almost entirely in the dark?  They also changed quite a few things from the book. This was a very disappointing Harry Potter movie.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942717,B004WMKSH2, A1D27BCSYV7VWH,1.0, Digital Copy Not Included!!,"Note: This is not a rating on the movie itself, this is on the Warner Brothers (WB) misleading packaging suggesting the digital copy is included.<br /><br />I got the 3 pack and of course paid extra for it but when it arrived there were 3 DVD's but no digital copy, the 3rd DVD is just special features, of which the digital copy is not one of them.<br /><br />If you look at the cover or product description is says Three-Disc-Combo Blu-ray / DVD Combo + digital copy. Don't know about you but when I see three disc combo, and that description I assumed the three listed on cover and description are actually in the package, it isn't, instead the 3rd disc is the Special Features. I got the TRON combo pack, which said it had a digital copy and it really did...<br /><br />Very misleading in my opinion, but wait, it gets worse.<br /><br />When I went to Download it, you can't even just download the movie, it makes you download a 510MB Installer (bigger than the Windows 7 Installer!). Once you have the installer it just gets worse as it then tries to make you take WB Digital Movie Manager even if you pick the option just for the movie.<br /><br />When I saw all of the junk it wanted to install I aborted out of it. So if you wanted the digital copy without a terabyte of overhead and garbage installed on your computer I would skip this deal and just get the movie without the junk.<br /><br />I like my digital copies on DVD, never saw this scam before, the WB application basically wants to take over your movie collection and report all of your movies back to WB, there are so many things wrong with that idea I will not even start, just say, Warner Brothers must be out of their mind and planning to dupe a bunch of kids. To date this is the most shamefull packaging of a Movie deal I have ever seen.<br /><br />The kicker is that if you do not agree to the totally unreasonable terms you get no digital copy. If I wanted to share the contents of my movie collection with WB I would send them an email with the list, nor will I install an application where I have no control or view in to what it is sending home, it should be illegal to put spyware like that on your system but the agreement makes you give them permission to hunt around on your PC and pass the information back to WB.<br /><br />So sad they pull this on anyone but you know this will end up on tons of PC with unsuspecting users piling more junk on their PC and WB Exclusive spyware. This is a good package to avoid unless you have to have the digital copy of this at any cost.<br /><br />If you opt for the iTunes version and not the Windows version you are not forced to take the WB manager, but you are then stuck with only being able to play it on systems with iTunes.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Usually with new releases and the upscale DVD player, it turns out really well, not as good as Blu-Ray but still a pretty good picture. Not the case with this one. WOW. Lots of jagged lines around the images like I was watching a bad copied version. I never thought they would have done this to todays Harry Potter.<br /><br />As for the movie, It was slow alot of the times. I started to get bored really. The action scenes were good but it felt to me like they were trying to kill time around the middle part of the movie. That with the poor quality, I didn't enjoy this release as much as the past chapters. I hope they fix part 2.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Much is left out of the movie, but I know that from seeing it in the theater rather than watching the DVD. The standard DVD is so dark that the screen is completely black in many places, with only voices rather than picture. Watching this DVD is kind of like listening to a very abridged audio book. And no, it is not my DVD player. I tried the DVD (two at this point) in another DVD player and on my MacBook with the same results.

I loved the movie but the picture on BOTH the BLU-RAY and DVD were pixelated as hell. I know it isn't my PS3 or TV as they work great on every other movie. I took it back to BB and exchanged it. The next one did the same thing. I have seen other reviews indicating the same problem. The picture is very grainy and pixielated. This is extremely noticeable and seriously distracting during the movie. This is apparently caused by the transition from film to digital. Warner Brothers should seriously fix this.,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

I just bought Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and watched it for the 3rd time.  I missed the parts of the books that couldn't be in the movie, because of time constraints, but found the last chapter of Harry's life on screen to be ""believable"" and compelling.<br /><br />I mourned the loss of characters that have been part of my life since the day I closed the cover on ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"", but in movie's, as in life, things don't always turn out the way you would like. As in ""real"" life, in ""reel"" life, people die and we don't always get what we thought we wanted.  This movie brought Harry (and his readers) to a logical end of childhood and the beginning of his 'grown-up' life.<br /><br />Thank you, J.K.

I'm such a ""Potter Geek"" that I went to the theatre to see the films when they wre released, and then wnet and bought my down DVD copy.  ""Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" delivered all fo theaction and special effects I expected and more.  While, I could see some of where the story was going, I must admit, I was surprised a number of times.  The actors have evolved beautifully into their roles in these films and the they do not disappoint in ""Deathly Hallows"" Part 1.  I've of course already bought ""Deathly Hallows"" Part 2, but that's another story.  Suffice it to say, the Harry Potter story is a super piece of work.  I don't recommend it for little ones, although it might be fun at first, as most know it grows darker as the series progresses.

4942740,B004WMKSH2, A385BQDTPESOGX,4.0, Deathly Hallows part 1 blue ray DVD,"The film itself was much much better watching it again after watching Deathly Hallows Part 2. The first time I watched this as a rental before Pt 2 was out I was not impressed, thought it was the least dynamic and interesting of the Potter films - kind of dull and flat, lack of plot elements as well as ""new scenery"" of the world created by Rowling. This is probably why it's so inexpensive even on blue ray. I must say I enjoy it more now on re-run.<br /><br />Bought this and Part 2 because of the upcoming ""blackout"" on Potter DVDs/broadcasts/streaming availability that is going to happen in 2012 and will last until Warner Bros. releases the new box set some time in 2012 or possibly even 2013. I do like to have Harry Potter ""marathon weekends"" on my own time, especially holed up during snowstorms and since I have all the other movies I didn't want to wait for the box set to watch the whole saga when I want to. And of course if the box set does not provide extended versions of these films with ample extra footage in all of them in my opinion it will be pointless to have since I'm not a collector but watch for ""entertainment value"".",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

I love the fact that Harry, Ron and Hermione are off on their own, a quest for the horcruxs, a sort of twisted road trip capped off with a brilliant animated sequence telling the tale of the 3 brothers and the deathly hallows.  Also, Voldimort is in truly wicked form as evil has descended on the wizarding world.  It stands alone as a great addition to the Harry Potter franchise and of course sets up the grand finally of part 2 and grand is an understatement!  I like watching parts 1&2 back to back...good times!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942742,B004WMKSH2, A1DK5AZMXS1QA3,5.0, Almost the end,"Finally, the moviemakers behind the Harry Potter films did the right thing and broke up a book into two movies, something that should have been done from the very first book.  Given that, this is still a long movie, clocking in at almost 2.5 hours, without any additional footage separate from the theatrical release.  This film is part action, part suspense, part drama, with a little comedy and romance thrown in.  There is magic, but not so much of it as to overwhelm the plot lines, of which there are several.  First is the quest of Harry and friends to find the Deathly Hollows.  Second is the relationship between Ron and Harry both over Hermione and with regards to each other.  Then comes the separate tragedies of the various wizards and muggles as they fall prey to Voldermort.  Last, but not least, is Voldermort himself, and his quest to find Harry Potter.  Mixed in is a very original and effective retelling of the Deathly Hallows story narrated by Hermione, some key deaths, and further insights into Dumbeldorf's past.  Overall, a great movie and well worth the purchase, especially considering the news that Warner Brothers will remove all the Potter DVD's from store shelfs early 2012.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Not the lack of extras.<br /><br />SPOILER!!!! SPOILER!!!SPOILER!!! If you do NOT know what happens, PLEASE STOP NOW!!!!!<br /><br />Everything you thought about Snape? Well, you were wrong (personally, I saw that coming). Dumbledor was more of a finagler that you EVER thought, even in death. The bad guys get there's BIG TIME. Harry has kids who go to Hogwarts 19 years after the end of the film.<br /><br />Okay, now to MY review. I know almost everyone knows what happens in this dvd by now. I am 58, and a huge fan of this series. Deathly Hallows 1 was a very very dark set-up to finish with DH 2. The CG effects in DH2 are way better than any of the other films. There is not ONE moment that doesn't have you on the edge of your seat/couch. The filming is dark when it needs to be, and bright when it should be. The characters are no longer young kids, they have arrived into adults, and play that role. The soundtrack...excellent. Subdued and used purely to accent the action. While the plot takes you to the inevitable end, you find yourself embracing it, and, even though it is the end of this fantastic series, accepting. You will bury your face in your hands at the sad parts (yes, I may have shed a few tears), but shout cheers at you tv for the victories. And after all, isn't that WHY we watch this series? My ONLY sorrow, is there isn't more. The world created in this series is a very special world. And I will miss it.<br /><br />As to the DVD set, there are NO extras. At all.

4942769,B004WMKSH2, A3DDPQ9342UNMY,4.0," These hallows are darker than dark...deadly, but fascinating...","These hallows are not only ""deathly,"" they're ""darker than dark.""<br /><br />Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don't mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It's the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don't know but the lighting technicians didn't account for correct light exposure, that's for sure.<br /><br />Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly ""in support."" All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.<br /><br />Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter's most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.<br /><br />The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort's secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Voldemort, but it's enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.<br /><br />Summing up: Many of the ""dark"" scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry's odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942770,B004WMKSH2, A2NXRBV0BQL5Z5,5.0, An American's review,"Well, I will begin this interview by saying, 'whats NOT to say about this charming, coming of age tale of wonder, wizadry, and groovy groovy times!' Lol.<br /><br />I'll begin by commenting about the cover...you are drawn into the movie from the get go when you see this cover, like all good covers should do to you.<br />what do we see? we see three trainee-wizards, each with a magic wand and one a girl called hermione, running through a wood. Harry Potter, the main character,wears something of a fearful expression on his handsome, slightly nerdy features, his eyes sleepy behind his infamous lenses. Ronald takes up the rear, also looking doubtful, as they sprint towards their destination. But little hermione,striding calmly at H.Potter's shoulder...there is a glint in her eye. The wand is like a sparkler in her gloved hand and her eyes are bright with purpose.<br /><br />And it is this sparkle, this explosion of destiny behind those dark, calm eyes, that is more or less the key to not just this Harry Potter movie, but every HP movie and indeed the whole philosophy and ethic of the shimmery, effervescent Rowling-conceived Universe.<br /><br />And now for the movie itself...well, its good. 'Harry Potter 2' good. Not since I first saw the little goblin guy Dobby that theyre friends with with the funny voice (Dobby) has my faith in this wonderful wonderful franchise felt so strong, to see this beautifully misunderstood creature return in such a moving way.<br /><br />Although Harry Potter is my favourite fictional character of all time, I shall stick my two hands up at this stage in the interview and admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Harry Potter stories:I've never read the books...(it's my firm decision to never read any books that have been adapted into films; they spoil the films because they're always way better (read 'Jaws' by Peter Benchley for a fruitful example of this)) so naturally Im not a massive admirer of the movie adaptations, but this was hands down my favourite of the 7.<br /><br />Having watched the Potter franchise develop from when I was a kid to now, I feel like I have grown up with my three good friends, Harry, Ronald Weasley and Hermione...<br /><br />And growing up never felt so damn good.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942773,B004WMKSH2, A27B9V8LUVHPBZ,5.0, Very Enjoyable,"I previously saw this film on the screen at our local movie theater.  Viewing it for the first time on my home system was both a delight and revelation.  Things I had not noticed in the theater almost jumped out when viewing it at home.  The quality was excellent even in the DVD format (until I get a new blu-ray player I will have to wait for the ""blu-ray"" experience)<br />  As far as the movie itself goes I recommend not even watching this one UNLESS you have Part 2 in hand.  The desire to complete the story is stronger than the desire to start a new movie the previous parts (1-6) left the viewer with.<br />  If it's been a while since you have viewed the other parts in this series the first thing that presents itself is how much these characters have aged and then how much they have, and have not, changed emotionally and mentally.  Three 17 year old kids off on a lark they are not and the uncertainty, doubt and fear they experience can be seen and, at times, even felt.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

It was mostly just having Harry, Ron, ad Hermione run around Britain hiding from Voldemort. But even though it wasn't too action packed, it was still a great movie that followed the book very well.

Some of the other movies (particularly The Goblet of Fire) left out ALOT from the book, which I missed.  Clearly after seeing how long the two movies are, there is no way they could have included all of the story in one movie and done it justice.  I'm very glad they decided to spend the money and the time to make it two movies and do it right.<br /><br />Goblet of Fire will always remain my favorite story line, but this one has to be a close second, and I thought it was done very well.  I particularly liked the animation of the story of the Deathly Hallows as Hermione is reading it; very creative.  As always, I thought most of the acting was great, and the special effects were fantastic.  As a fan of both the books and the movies, it is hard to come up with much negative to say.  That said, I have only read the book once, so I cannot speak to inaccuracies or discrepancies, so if that kind of thing really nags at you I cannot recommend one way or the other.

4942797,B004WMKSH2, A2582KMXLK2P06,5.0, now THIS is more like it!,"I wasn't a fan of the previous Harry Potter film because it was extremely shy on the actual magic and didn't contain enough action for my liking, but Deathly Hallows is a pretty remarkable improvement on *both* accounts.  To me the magical aspect of the Harry Potter series is a vital addition to the storytelling.  It really enhances the feeling of adventure.  I'm happy to report that it's back again, thankfully.<br /><br />As expected by the title of the film alone, it's about Lord Voldemort attempting to officially capture and rid the world of Harry Potter once and for all.  Will he succeed?  That's definitely not for me to spoil, hehe.<br /><br />The setting is quite the surprise as well.  Harry Potter and his friends almost never step foot inside a castle which makes the movie feel different, but not in a distracting kind of way or anything.  Most of the adventure takes places outside in the empty forests or occasionally in the city streets.  A major part of the storyline is on Harry Potter and the gang being cloned into lookalike Harry Potter's and being able to disappear whenever signs of danger present themselves (which is pretty much the norm by this point but used to great effect this time around).<br /><br />Some of my favorite scenes are when Harry Potter was outside in the dark woods by himself and he spots a glowing, mystical deer walking around.  To me this was a *beautiful* moment of creativity.  Another really fascinating and bizarre moment of viewing material (and storytelling for that matter) came later when the story surrounding Death takes place and how Death tricks people into being loyal through conniving ways.  It's actually a very interesting story and even someone like me who normally daydreams through such moments was paying close attention and enjoying it.  Good writing.<br /><br />Overall, great acting by all the characters like always, beautiful sceneries, magical superpowers dominate, good suspense and storyline development come together to create an entertaining chapter in the Harry Potter films.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

We've been sharing and enjoying these adventures through the years and now he's ready to graduate from high school and go off to college. Oh, the movie.

4942807,B004WMKSH2, A1UUA09VX5KWKM,5.0, Magical!,"For starters let me be clear! I am a hard core 'Potter' aficionado who knows everything about the saga like I know my own palm....BUT...I'm not the fan that says: ""Oh they changed that!"" and ""They did that wrong!"" for one and only reason: Books and films are different; they target a somewhat different audience and have different views. And more importantly sth that is good on page doesn't mean that it will look good on screen. Take comic-book heroes' funky costumes for example.<br />So entering the next-to-last 'Potter' film I will say that it is phenomenal! It has heart, character development, scenes to get teary or even cry about, special effects and -being the first part of the finale- sets up the pace for the last 'Potter' outing, perfectly.<br />I am one person that will say what the producers and writer did RIGHT with the changes they made and support WHY they made them. [spoiler ALERT]<br />A) They added the actual scene that Hermione took the memories of her from her parents.<br />In a teary prologue-for-the-finale scene that shows what the trio is up to, preparing for their journey of finding and destroying Voldemort's horcruxes (which are bits of Voldemort's soul and the key of his immortality), Hermione takes away all memories of her, from her parents to protect them. The score in this scene is excellent and a teary Hermione looks around the living room as she fades away from all the family photos. So emotional. And her leaving alone her house while crying before the logo is revealed. Wow! It is the end.<br />B) Death of Hedwig<br />It was a somewhat small dissapointment I had from Jo's excellent book that Hedwig that made such an impression as an owl and with the famous ""Hedwig's theme"" to have such a 'collateral damage' death. So I liked they made her die like a hero ttrying to save Harry from a deatheater and thus making it the reason why Voldemort realises who is the real Harry. Great, great scene!<br />C) Harry and Ginny's seperation<br />While I admire Harry's bravery and heroism as he will be forever my childhood hero I found lame and predictable that he broke up with Ginny at the end of 'Half-Blood Prince' book to protect her. I like more that they got seperated because of the circumstances now that the trio is hunted...<br />D) Dobby<br />Since they had not included Dobby in the previous films I found very logical his reappearence in Diagon Alley as he is now free to go wherever he wants.<br />E) Harry and Hermione dancing<br />In a newly added scene Harry and Hermione are dancing to 'O' Children' by Nick Cave. There was a lot of debait with this scene as some of the fans found that it had a romantic subtext. NO! It's one of the most beautifully written scenes ever. Harry and Hermione shared a friendship different that his and Ron's and now alone, he wanted to cheer her up. They are children that are going through things that children who are 17 years old shouldn't so the song is spot on. The scene is excellent.<br /><br />The acting is stop-notch and especially in this film that the grown-up cast is not so much around the young cast is shining truly! Emma Watson is incredible and steals almost everyone's thunder! Oh and there is a certain animation scene that really is like it's gotten out of a dream! This is a magical film, I totally recomend it and I can't wait to enjoy 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2' in my TV screen!<br /><br />P.S.

4942815,B004WMKSH2, A3CZ2LBO8VVDN6,5.0, Deathly Hallows Part 1 Blu-ray = Phenomenal!,"*Please note this review is for the quality of the film on Blu-ray disc only.*<br /><br />This movie follows the first part of the 7th book quite well, and is mostly character development. Splitting the book into two films definitely turned out to be a good idea.<br /><br />For part 1, the picture quality is fabulous overall. That's a given with these films. Many reviewers commented on how this movie is so dark its difficult to see on their televisions, whether it's the Blu-ray or the dvd. They are right. This movie is DARK. Both in content, and with respect to the filming. It's supposed to be that way. This is a torture test for television black levels. If you want to enjoy the potter movies at home in the same way you saw them in the theater, you need a dark room and an HDTV with deep black levels. If you have this combination, the movie's level of intensity goes up exponentially.<br /><br />The 5.1 DTS-HD master audio track is better than the picture quality. In fact, if you have a decent home theater with a good receiver that can decode master audio, the track easily beats out what you would hear in a typical movie theater, by a long shot. Should you turn it up to near THX reference volume (only do this if you have decent speakers...reference is loud!), every single little nuance is there, and it's incredible. This is one of the few tracks in modern cinema that truly pulls the viewer into the lives of the characters. There are bass rumbles when need be, but a large chunk of the film is quiet with just dialogue and background ambiance. It adds to the intensity, which is unrivaled by this point.<br /><br />Wow, wow, wow. That's all there really is to say if you watch this on Blu-ray with a good setup. If you don't have a good setup, I suggest starting to build one before the entire Harry Potter collection comes out :)",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

I was so excited when this movie came out but sad also as this one is the beginning of the end of the series.  How sad!  I think the producers were correct in making 2 movies out of the final book in order to get the detail and to keep the storyline intact.  The effects were good and the acting much better than years past.  I think for anyone who has not read the final book they might have some problems understanding what certain wands mean or who certain people are, but in general it was easy to follow.  It will be interesting to see how the final movie comes together at the end. Exactly how graphic will it be?  What will the director and writers choose to focus on?

4942829,B004WMKSH2, A1SHNOU2ODKIDG,3.0, Understand what you are buying before you buy it.,"This review is for the Bly-ray/DVD combo pack.  Buyers should be aware that the only way to watch the special features for DEATHLY HOLLOWS is on the bluray disc.  They are not included on the DVD or digital copy.  As for the special features on the bluray disc, they are okay, consisting of mostly standard featuretts and the maximum movie gimmick that has all sorts of interviews and even readings from the book included while the movie plays.  It's okay but I can't imagine watching it more than once.  Beware of the digital copy as it includes lots of spyware and garbage you may not want on your computer (and the download takes up a mind boggling amount of space).  The transfer of both the bluray and the parts of the DVD that I checked seemed fine to me.  Complaints about the darkness and lack of color in the film seem to be fairly true to the original look of the film and are not really the result of a terrible transfer.  This is however by no means an exceptional looking disc.  Take ""professional"" reviews of discs on sights like HighDef Digest with a grain of salt as negative reviews from them mean repercussions from the studios who send them all sorts of freebies, swag and other forms of ""payment"" for good reviews.  On a well calibrated HDTV above 46 inches the bluray (and upconverted DVD transfer) of DEATHLY HOLLOWS will look fine but it certainly isn't ever going to pop or look colorful (and it isn't supposed to).  There is also some digital noise during a few sequences on the BD and they were more pronounced on the DVD.  There isn't any excuse for it other than slopiness from Warner. As far as the playability issues, they are most likely due to a DRM change at Warner and you will have to do a firmware update to your BD player.  If you have a player more than a couple years old (unless you are using a PS3) you will probably be out of luck and will have to watch the DVD or buy a new BD player.  /  This is a very standard 3 disc release these days which means you get (mostly) the same thing in three different versions.  If you want all the special features the only way to get them is on the BD version.  Walmart has a DVD only version that has special features but it DOES NOT include the maximum movie material which makes up the bulk of the special features. This scenario is becoming more and more common (standard practice for Disney with every release) and if studios make money from it ... it isn't going away any time soon so do your homework before you buy a disc.  It sucks but thats the way things are going.<br /><br />By the way...the PQ on the DEATHLY HOLLOWS bluray isn't any brighter or more vibrant than the DVD but there is a bit less noise.  THE AQ is noticeably better.  Undoubtedly Warner is saving lots of good stuff for the Ultimate box set edition which will be released after the final film.  Then the Limited Collectors Edition.  Then the Anniversary Edition.  Then the MudBlood Half Prince Hedwig Memorial Edition with collectible film cell made from genuine digital frame capture.  Then the Hagrid's Hut Edition with Keepsake keychain............",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

This rating is only for the DVD itself- I though the film itself was one of the best (and definitely the most loyal) Potter film to date. But why are there no options for special features for DVD buyers? I was looking forward to purchasing a special edition two disc DVD loaded with special features for a fan like me, only to realize the only feature was additional scenes. No behind the scenes footage. No preview for the upcoming movie. No-that's only for people with a Blu Ray player. You think with the economy the way it is WB would realize many people can't afford higher priced products like a Blu Ray player, and it's unfair to make all the good features exclusive to that disc. It didn't make me want to buy a player-it just made me mad. If they do this for the final film I will be sorely disappointed.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

It is $19.--something and it has all the special features the combo pack has except the opening scene for DH part II which I don't find that big of a deal because the movie is coming out soon and the fact that you can get it in the combo pack means that there is a pretty good chance that it can be found on youtube or on the Harry Potter Facebook page.  So to all you people peeved by the DVD I say again go to Wal-mart. I did so last night and watched all the special features and the movie (the quality of the movie is even better--I don't know what WB is playing at).  I feel much better.<br />Also I don't know if this will make you feel any better but I found out that for people with blu-ray they had to get the combo pack in order to see the special features. If they bought just the blu-ray edition not the combo pack all you get for special features is the delete/additional scenes (just like if you got just the DVD).<br />Why would WB do something like that?--I am naive I guess.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942835,B004WMKSH2, A39KKQQ6IF54XP,2.0, Mediocre movie. Poor DVD.,"The first half of the book was pretty slow, so I wasn't surprised to see this movie was as well. Unfortunately, as a movie, this entry in the Harry Potter series really doesn't stand up on it's own. It's basically just filling the gap between the previous film and the upcoming final conflict. I suppose given the amount of story that is covered in the novel, this is a necessary evil.<br /><br />What I really want to review is the DVD picture quality. Oh my...it is bad. This is bar none the worst DVD quality I've seen since the original days of DVD. Compression artifacts are everywhere. Most noticeable is the area around Harry's glasses. There's nothing like mucking up the main character's face. As other reviewers have stated, the DVD isn't even at full capacity. Why press a DVD with unused space? I really hope this wasn't done on purpose to promote BluRay.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942837,B004WMKSH2, A1FI7I5I956LO8,4.0," Flawed, but better on 2nd+ viewing","ALERT! SOME REVEALS HERE!<br /><br />Anyone coming to this film w/o having seen the previous movies in the franchise has no grounds for complaint. However, as a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the books -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the stories as they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, as the movies *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative.<br /><br />Fundamental story matters are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it was explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the ""unnamed eighth"" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.)<br /><br />I've a fair eye for such details, so when major details like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film was almost unintelligible to me. That takes some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort.<br /><br />That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line makes more sense, and the gaps and flaws of part I are much less distracting so that the OTHER details of the story-telling can now shine through.<br /><br />Those other details really are very well done. But the flaws in the film make those finer moments difficult, if not impossible, to fully appreciate on the first viewing.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

When Ron left and then finally returned, I just wanted Hermione to run and put her arms around him and be happy he was back. It was so depressing and sad. Just kiss and make up for gosh sakes!! I did make my boys cover their eyes of course when Harry and Hermione were in a semi-naked vision of sorts, made by Voldermort to make Ron jealous. All in all I thought it was a good film.

In Dumbledore's last will and testament, Harry receives the Golden Snitch. Ron receives the Deluminator, and Hermione gets a book. Each will help in their journey.

4942856,B004WMKSH2, A25UZ7MA72SMKM,4.0," Expertly brought to the screen, but very dark.","When I say this film is dark, I don't mean in its visual presentation, which is superb. The cinematography and special effects are top notch. But much like ""Half Blood Prince"", DH Part 1 has very little of the delight and joy which were evident in the early books and movies. Yes, those stories had the dark elements associated with Voldemort and in the dangerous seeming climaxes, but other parts of the stories were highly entertaining and uplifting in their depiction of life at Hogwarts. Harry's problems with his aunt, uncle, and cousin were played for laughs. Classroom scenes were at time frustrating, and at times funny, but always interesting.<br /><br />At some point in this process JK Rowling lost the wonder of her early books, and began to see herself as a SERIOUS WRITER OF DRAMA. At that point all the fun drained out of her stories. I have finished them merely to finish them, not because I really had fun with the last books, or these last three movies. DH Part 1 is a lot like ""The Dark Knight"" in that the movie is expertly crafted, but just gives the viewer very little hang onto in terms of tension breaks. I think this is a big mistake for any movie. The goal of a movie such as this should be to entertain the audience, not exhaust them. I'll have no problem re-watching the first five movies at times, but I seriously doubt there will be ANY repeat viewings of the final three movies for me. Just as even though I'm a big time Batman fan, I've had absolutely no desire to watch ""The Dark Knight"" a second time. Unrelenting tension and misery for the main characters isn't my thing. I get enough of that just running a business. LOL<br /><br />So if you have read all the books and watched the first six films, certainly there is no way you are going to miss this one, or the conclusion. You have too much invested in the story over the years, just as we do. You will be impressed at the special effects, which are so natural to this vision of a magical society by now that you will forget that they ARE special effects. You'll be uplifted at our heroes' little victories, and sad at the tragedies which befall them. If you're like me, in the end you may also feel a bit empty, because the charm and joy which the first books and movies in this series promised is long gone by the stark and depressing tone of its ending.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942858,B004WMKSH2, A1VGQC66HKIF3V,4.0, Book-to-Movie-Gritted-Teeth Aside...,"This film adaptation to the first segment of JK Rowling's final Harry Potter book was acceptable. The imagery and film quality greatly make up for the flawed story line that was strewed together by the film writers. Characters are consistent from one film to the next, and therefore cannot be discredited for their out-of-place appearances later in the series. Realizing that film is a much different medium to tell a story, the point of the films is really to admire the beauty of the world Jo made for us. Thank you.<br /><br />However, this movie is far from a 5-star rating. The ending was rather anti-climactic. I was severely disappointed with the closing scene. The viewer was left without any ""what next?"" left in their mind, and instead were left with a sequence unrelated to what the lead characters must do from their previous predicaments.<br /><br />If you've read the books, this movie ends at the conclusion of chapter 24, yet about 2-3 pages before the actual end to that chapter.<br /><br />I'm extremely glad that I did not see this movie in theaters... otherwise, I would have been sorely disappointed and not really given to wait another year or two for the conclusion...

4942860,B004WMKSH2, A34D06JL7LC6MU,5.0," Fast-Paced, Entertaining, and Emotional - A Great Entry in This Great Franchise","2010's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the beginning of the end for this franchise, which began nine years ago with the cinematic adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I must admit that while I'm a Harry Potter fan, I'm not quite a Harry Potter fanboy. I read the first five books and enjoyed them immensely, but didn't read the last two. It's no fault of the series that I neglected to do so, merely my lack of drive to do so. I have seen all six of the previous films, each in the year of their release and only once. I know that Harry Potter fans can be hard to please, especially when it comes to Hollywood adapting their sacred text. It seems no matter how faithful the screenwriters stick to the story, there is always room for error here. With that in mind, I am only at liberty to discuss this as a standalone film; not bothering to compare it to the previous films nor discuss how it differs from the novels. What I can tell you, and it should come as no surprise, is that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 functions as a film in context with the other books/movies. If you have not seen any of the previous films, don't bother seeing this one. If you've skipped a couple films or a couple books, but are familiar enough with the ones you've skipped, you may find this film mostly enjoyable...But I recommend having as much knowledge as possible before watching this; I admit even I was unable to catch a few references throughout.<br /><br />In describing the plot, not that the plot or anyone involved in it need introduction, I'll be careful not to offend the spoiler police. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is gaining power throughout the Wizarding and Muggle worlds, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is in far greater danger than he ever imagined. With Voldemort in constant pursuit of him, Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must locate the remaining Horcruxes (powerful objects in which Voldemort has hidden fragments of his soul) in order to eventually destroy the Dark Lord.<br /><br />The excitement level of this entry rarely lets up and the film is very fast paced, but what's remarkable is that there's an actual plot behind the action and part one isn't just an introduction to the epic battle that will likely take place in part two. While most Hollywood productions begin to drone on and get lazy by the second installment (sometimes after a lazy first installment), the Harry Potter films, seven films in, continues to thrive and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 may be one of the strongest entries in the series. I can say without a doubt that it's better than the sixth film.<br /><br />This film is such a strong entry in part because it works on levels of story, adventure, character, and plot. I initially found the decision to split the book into two films a way for the studio to milk this franchise for every last dime, but I concede that this was a great idea. It allows the filmmakers to finish this tale without sacrificing any of the necessary elements that have made people embrace these films. Here is a film, a Hollywood blockbuster no less that moves at a fast-pace yet continues to move, un-rushed, through the plot and develop its characters further. I think it's hard to deny the effect of a film when it elicits sympathy over an elf. Yes, for a movie about witchcraft and wizardry, there's a surprising amount of effective emotional cues throughout.<br /><br />All of the actors who have worked tirelessly for the last decade have really blossomed in their roles, particularly the three leads: Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson. They've grown into these characters and are completely convincing. Any doubt about their casting should be brushed away if it hasn't been already. Fiennes' performance as Voldemort is a particularly impressive feat, especially when one considers that the wrong actor could come off as completely ridiculous in this role. There's a lot of makeup and CGI involved in the physical creation of Voldemort and yet Fiennes makes him wholly believable and appropriately menacing. His performance is wonderfully realized, as Voldemort does come off as an incarnation of evil without becoming a computer-generated joke. Fiennes also adds a certain amount of pathos that I think few actors could muster. In addition, the actors all share a chemistry and on-screen bond that can only be acquired from knowing and working with their group for many years. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing best friends for ten years and they're a believable group. Most of the 145 minutes of part one focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione's quest to find the Horcrux, leaving little room for other actors to really strut their stuff; but Alan Rickman (as Snape) continues to stand out as memorable, even with little screentime. Meanwhile, Dobby (played, in voice, by Toby Jones), the memorable house-elf, is adorable, making for effective comedic relief and lending the film one of its most surprisingly emotional moments.<br /><br />In addition to these various elements related to story, one can't ignore the high production value of this film. Yes, it has plenty of CGI (lending perfectly to the mystical aspect of the series), but it's also beautifully rendered with the world of the books lovingly recreated. Ten people are credited with various aspects of set design, production design, and art direction and their efforts set the movie-world of Harry Potter apart from everything else. Meanwhile, the cinematography by Eduardo Serra looks absolutely majestic.<br /><br />The Harry Potter films rarely get enough credit. Despite being extremely well-made, high-grossing films based on a beloved series of novels they're mostly grouped into the category of simple Hollywood blockbusters. While the previous entries in the series only exist in my mind as vague memories, I can say from this film and those small recollections of the previous films that these are high-quality films that deserve more attention than they've received. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a fine film; an emotional, entertaining, and all-around terrific set-up for part two. It's a film that long-time fans of Harry Potter will not want to miss and new fans will want to get through the others to watch as soon as possible. It's worth the wait.<br /><br />GRADE: A-",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

This is a pretty good film and good set up for the battle of Hogwarts and final duel.<br /> I must say Hedwig had a much more heroic death in the film. In the book she just died in her cage.<br />But they should have used JK's dialogue between Harry and Ron about the deluminator.<br /><br />Ron: Dumbledore left it to me because he knew I would run out on you.<br />Harry: NO Dumbledore left it to you because he knew you would always want to come back.<br /><br />Or SOMETHING kinda like that, I can not seem to find it in the book now, but it was far more moving than the movie version.<br /><br />I am going to scribble on my scar with purple sharpie [ Dead center of my skull right between my eyes as JK intended.] Put on my round glasses, my black cape grab my wand and off to the final film.

However we must warn others that transfer is absolutely terrible, with several scenes unwatchable due to screen being completely black.  We are quite disappointed that Amazon would sell this product at all, much less at a premium price.

The world is falling apart and Voldemort is getting set at his wizarding world take over.  This movie in particular seems to put Harry and crew in more adult situations.  Rather than getting punched by Malfoy, the penalty for failure in this movie is death.  I really liked this movie.  The only problem I had was a very adult sequence where Ron imagines Harry and Hermione together.  They are not clothed when this happens.  You don't see any nudity, but we are a far cry away from when the actors seemed like they were in 5th grade.<br /><br />I still recommend this movie and will be seeing the last on in the theaters in about a month!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Anything longer, and you have to cut a lot out.<br /><br />This movie is very true to the first half of the book, and I'm delighted that they managed to cram in as much as they did.<br /><br />It's all at least as well done as the rest of the series, in other words, superlative, and I'm very happy with it.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

While I am an adult, I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter films and taking my niece and nephews to see them.  This one I missed in the theaters.  I am glad I waited for the DVD release.  It mainly showcases the 3 principle actors and is filmed very dark.  It kept my interest, but was just a prequel to the big finale in Part  II.  Frankly, they could have shortened this to an hour and put it with II and shown us the movie as one big send off.

As always, this movie perfectly blended both action and dialog to captivate and entertain me throughout.<br /><br />Harry Potter movies are always fantastic, but Deathly Hallows Part 1 is even better.

Not that they all were not amazing.  This movie was epic, and left every viewer wanting more.  It showed a side of Harry all his fans were dying to see, and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint complemented the movie better than ever before.  It was full of triumph, had me in crying, had me on the edge of my seat and made me laugh all in the first hour.  The movie was EPIC, but i do recommend anyone watch ALL the previous Harry Potter movies before jumping in, or they simply will not appreciate the beauty of this new instant classic",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942884,B004WMKSH2, A254QJ5BTEUH85,4.0, Harry Potter Vs Voldemort Soon Part 1,"Harry Potter and the Deatly Hallows part 1 is an much bigger improvement over The Half Blood Prince. I went to the theatre to see THBP and was seriously bored. There were some comical moments that got a few laughs from me and the audience at least. The problem was the whole thing was almost entirely focused on romance. Only the last few minutes do they show what Voldemort's crew are up to. And it was not much unfortunately. I heard the book had much more to them on the final scene of the movie.<br /><br />The Deathly Hallows Part 1 gets us back on track, where the Harry Potter series has been going. The best thing the previous Potter showed were the Horcrux's. I won't spoil what that's about, but Harry is on a quest to destroy these artifacts. Voldemort is around more this time. He has sent out his Death Eaters to infiltrate the Ministestry of Magic. Many laws are changed, especially against the muggels, the non-magic users.<br /><br />Bellatrix and a few other Death Eaters play a seprate roll from the infiltrators and that's to go capture Harry Potter. Hermoime and Ron stick very close to Harry, and not just out of friendship. Alastor, Hargrid, and many others try to use themselves to shield Harry from harm. Harry openly objects to everyone doing this. He cares a lot about his friends and mentors. The Death Eaters won't rest in this one. They actively are on the hunt for Harry.<br /><br />There is a big break from the constant action later on, which was needed eventually. I thought that provided good pacing in that way. At this point in the movie Harry is in hiding along with Hermoime and Ron. They help Harry on his quest to destroy the Horcrux's at the same time. The stress of the situation really does show with the three. Ron is scared and barely talks, he is on edge. He keeps listening to the radio of the take over from Voldemort. Harry gets very defensive to everyone. Hermoime is despressed, but deals with things not too badly in this nightmare scenario.<br /><br />This feels like half a story, well...because it is. That's why I couldn't give this one 5 stars. This is much more improved from the previous movie. The Deathly Hallows part 1 makes a nice setup for the second one coming this year. It'll be the last of the Harry Potter's, so this one is a definite watch to complete the whole story.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942889,B004WMKSH2, A3VHPJ0MYNUUGX,4.0, I'm feeling a bit harried,"I've watched all the Harry Potter flicks, and this is my least favored. In part, this one seems like a prelude to the next movie, rather than an independent chapter in the series. Not having read the books, this seemed a long-winded, detail-laden, unpleasant, and to some extent, pointless conflict among kids who had been fast friends for a half-dozen prior movies.<br /><br />My wife, who has read the books, tells me that all this is necessary for the final movie, and herein I find my disappointment with the Potter movies. I believe that a movie should be it own creature, best suited to its medium, and not be slavishly bound to the source material. Clearly, these movies have been made to please the readers of the books. That makes a ton of money, but not necessarily the best movies possible.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

This one for the first fifteen minutes is utterly ridiculous. I couldn't see a thing and it was a good thing I knew the story or I would have had no idea what was going on. It was so aggravating.

The realization has come to Harry that everyone around him is in danger and he wants to protect them. But he also knows he can't do it alone. He has people that want to help and need to help if he is going to succeed. I laughed a little and I cried. Just a good movie.

It is MUCH darker, yes, but that works.  It's supposed to be darker, and I think it manages to convey the seriousness needed without going over-the-top or being indulgent.  It moves very very quickly, which is the only thing I had a bit of a difficult time with, but that's my own selfishness.  I didn't want it to end!  I know they had a great deal of story to fit in to a relatively short amount of time, but they hit the points I thought were necessary.  The 'added' scenes worked well, too, and I can't find an issue with any of them.

4942905,B004WMKSH2, A1DF3NZ1SQ5D4Y,5.0, The perfect set-up for the big finale,"I remember being so excited when the seventh book was finally published.  It was so bittersweet - wanting to know what happens, but not wanting it to end.  The first half of the book was hard!  It went on and on with little action or excitement.  But then, as I continued to read, I understood that Ms Rowling needed to get us inside Harry's head to set up the final sequence of events and to show that this was no easy Journey that Harry, Ron and Hermoine were on.  That they sacrificed greatly to reach their goal.  The movie, thankfully, was very true to the book.  It was not the easiest movie to sit through as it is a little depressing.  The viewer is taken along with Harry and the gang and it shows how hard it is on them - how easy it would have been to give up.  Of course they do not give up and the next movie will be worth the wait as part one has set the stage exactly as it should be.  Cudos to the director for giving us what we needed if it is not exactly what we wanted!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942913,B004WMKSH2, A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,4.0," Probably Should Not Have Split Year 7 into Two Films, but Entertaining Nonetheless.","The producers of the Harry Potter film franchise seem to have given up on using a different director with his or her unique style for every episode. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" is the third Harry Potter film directed by David Yates, whose previous work was mostly in British television. Yates seems to have been charged with directing the young wizard's darker years. J.K. Rowling's tome of Year 7 would have benefited from much tighter editing, but, unlike the previous two volumes, the filmmakers did not decide to correct this flaw for the silver screen. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is being presented as two installments on film. This is its only serious flaw. It could, or should, have skipped some of the wizard trio's camping adventures to create one, more focused three-hour film.<br /><br />The film begins on a dark note, literally. The Minister of Magic (Bill Nighy) announces, ""These are dark times,"" and the headlines of The Daily Prophet scream, ""Dark Mark Sparks Panic."" Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) erases herself from her parents' memories, and The Order of the Phoenix prepares to escort Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) to a safe house under deep cover. But Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) betrays their plans to Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Even the rare festivities of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding are interrupted by the death of the Minster of Magic and an attack of Death Eaters. Harry, Hermione, and Ron (Rupert Grint) are forced to flee. The only way to save the world from Voldemort's wrath is to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes that preserve his soul.<br /><br />There is an oddity in the tone of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". It gives the impression that all of the necessary information won't fit in the film, yet there is a lot of storyline that could have been cut out to make the film stronger. Too much included, while at the same time not enough is explained. True to the book, however, the film does not shy away from the realities of a fanatically oppressive faction coming to power in the wizarding world: persecution, torture, and death. And a lot of dark imagery. This might be too frightening for Harry Potter's youngest fans. The level of mayhem probably qualifies it as an action movie. The film is generally entertaining, if meandering in parts. I found the animation that illustrates the pivotal ""Tale of the Three Brothers"", as found in ""The Tales of Beedle the Bard"", particularly effective.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942914,B004WMKSH2, A2UFG3DMVELP6I,5.0, Just one more to go,Like most of the Harry Potter movies this one is no less exiting and action packed as the others.  I realy loved it and I cant wait for the last movie to come out.,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942917,B004WMKSH2, A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,4.0, THE LONGEST DRAWN OUT SERIES EVER,"I may be giving this movie 4 stars, but this will not be a glowing review. HARRY POTTER has one story. Throughout the entire series, there has been one central theme: Boy learns magic and comes closer to his destiny to face off against evil. Did it take 8 movies to get there? Not to say that I didn't enjoy all of the movies, HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, really hammers this point home for me as it ends dramatically and quite ceremoniously as if to say.... ""Come back again folks. Thanks for your cash."" This was just one more TEASER film building up to the payoff.<br /><br />I enjoy the HARRY POTTER movies. Don't get me wrong. Yet, it's like a bunch of movies centered around subplots building up to what is finally coming next in HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2. Resolution. Finale. I don't know if I want to say, ""Thank God."" or wish there were more movies coming. I think it's ""Thank God.""<br /><br />HARRY POTTER is the STAR WARS of this era, and I think they had more tact and circumstance then the STAR WARS series had, but both series made entire movies out of less than important story lines.<br /><br />DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is an okay movie in a series of good movies that are meandering and sometimes pointless but ultimately entertaining and good. PART 1 spends too much time being dramatic and world ending and hammering on the point that we should be afraid, very afraid. In doing so, it ultimately bores children who have been following the series to death and bores people like me who want the payoff to hurry up and get here for godsakes.<br /><br />DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 2 better not disappoint because we've sat through 7 movies of subplot to get here... sheeesshh.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

I was incredibly mad, however, at the quality and packaging of the film. On the plastic covering, it said that the DVD was made in Mexico. And the quality sucked. It was not clear and was slightly pixilated at certain points. The movie itself is amazing, just not the DVD. Plus, it only had 5 deleted scenes, and no other special features! That was dissapointing. It had:<br />15. The Dursley House<br />16. Dudley and Harry<br />83. Ministry of Magic Lifts<br />89. Tent<br />and<br />108. Ron and Hermione Skimming Stones",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942932,B004WMKSH2, AJNW2SVETWAW1,3.0," As a set-up for 'Part II' it works; as a stand-alone film, not so much","As others have said, `Deathly Hallows Part I' is a good film for fans of the 7th book.  David Yates is faithful to the novel (to a fault, perhaps), and those who enjoyed reading JK Rowling's final book in the Harry Potter series will be satisfied (especially since `Part II' is coming to theaters in just a few weeks).<br /><br />As a stand-alone film, however, `Part I' suffers for the same reason Rowling's book suffers - too much exposition, too many over-complicated plot threads to set up, and too little action.  It's not that nothing happens - actually, Yates manages to include all of the action sequences from the first 500 pages of the novel (the escape from Privet Drive, the aftermath of the wedding, the visit to Godric's Hollow, the incident at Luna's house, the Gringotts break-in, etc.).  But it all feels somewhat like a series of disconnected scenes cobbled together with too much talking, whining, and camping in between.  Like the book, the film focuses almost exclusively on our trio of teenage heroes as they try to track down and destroy a series of Horcruxes (magical objects containing segmented parts of Voldemort's soul) while at the same time avoiding detection and capture by followers of the Dark Lord.  Unfortunately, an awful lot of exciting-sounding things are happening to the characters who are NOT Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but neither the book nor the film lets us experience any of them.  And these other characters are sorely missed.<br /><br />There is so much sheer plot in this movie that it's difficult to keep up with it - there are so many things we need to understand to make sense of it all (the mythology of Horcruxes, the meaning of the titular Deathly Hallows, convoluted wand lore . . . and how they all play into the mission to bring down Voldemort and save the world for Wizards and Muggles alike).  And none of it goes anywhere in this film.  The final film will probably be more satisfying, since it actually has an ending . . . `Part I' does not.<br /><br />Several characters die in `Part I' - only one of them generates the kind of pain I expected (and as we see in the novel).  If anything, Yates sacrificed the emotional heart of the story in trying to stay so close to the overriding plot, probably the result of breaking the novel into two parts.  The pay-off will come in `Part II,' so it may all come together fine in the end.  Actually, Yates has a chance to improve on the novel in this final film - Rowling left us hanging a bit with her final few chapters (no Harry/Snape resolution, no Harry/Ginny reunion, no sense of the aftermath of that final battle at Hogwarts).  The `Part II' trailers suggest that Yates may have understood this.  I hope so.<br /><br />If you love the Potter universe, you've undoubtedly already seen this film.  If you're just curious, watch the other movies first.  And wait until July 14 to watch `Part I' - then you can rush right out and see `Part II' on July 15.  Perhaps together the films will do what `Part I' can't do alone.<br /><br />One final note - I watched this on a standard DVD on a pretty ordinary and inexpensive TV, and I did not find the scenes excessively dark or difficult to see.  Since so many reviewers mentioned the poor quality of the ""transfer"" on the DVD, I'm not sure what this means.  I had no problems.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942933,B004WMKSH2, A2R9NG5SF8MWQT,3.0, Frustrating and confusing,"You know the feeling when you come in late in a movie - say miss the first 5 minutes?  You never feel like you've caught up with the plot.  You feel frustrated and confused the entire time.  You want to ask someone, ""Who are these people, what are they doing, and why are they doing it?  What did I miss?""<br /><br />That's how I felt with this movie.  Since I was watching the DVD, obviously I didn't come in 5 minutes late, but it felt like it.  I felt I had missed part of the plot, and never quite caught up with the story line.  I believe the cut scene at the start, when Harry is talking with his aunt, would have helped, but it still might have felt this way.<br /><br />None of the others did this.  I always felt I came in at the beginning, and was able to follow the plot.<br /><br />This movie has to be watched if one is going to have any clue at all when Part II comes out, but I was (for the first time in the series) very disappointed.<br /><br />No, I haven't read the books.  However, one should not have to read the books to understand the movies.  They should be true to the books, but not depend on them for comprehending the plot.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942934,B004WMKSH2, A2PTIKVWVDB3LV,5.0, Love that Deathly Hallows was split into two,"First of all kudos to Amazon for a very quick April 15, 2011 arrival of my shipment.<br /><br />I will agree with other reviewers that the packaging for the DVD is extremely cheap. The front cover graphics look like a poor photocopy from a bad printer.  Regardless I bought the movie for the DVD itself and will not deduct points for the packaging. The DVD played just fine in my Blu-ray player.<br /><br />I decided to wait until the last movie is available for purchase before going Blu-ray on the whole set. Based on other reviews about the pixelation of the Blu-ray version that turns out to be a wise bet.<br /><br />There is no doubt in my mind that this movie will appeal more to the Harry Potter purists who have read every book. I have been disappointed in the later movies regarding how much important detail was omitted from the movies so it stands to reason that I am incredibly delighted with this movie. It beautifully captures the darkness of the time with gorgeous, moody landscapes, captures the draining, debilitating hopelessness Harry, Hermione and Ron feel at various points and slowly builds tension to the sudden abrupt ending.<br /><br />At the time I watched Deathly Hallows Part 1 in the movie theater I was almost angry at the abrupt ending but when you look at it in context, it does allow the second movie to flow seamlessly from the first Deathly Hallows movie. So I will be watching the first movie again just prior to watching the second movie in July 2011.<br /><br />The excellent attention to detail in this movie does not translate as well to the casual viewer and my younger daughter who has not read the last three books was a little lost. So I get both points of view about the decision to split the last book into two movies but I'm happy the purists won.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The story is meandering and pointless, the look of the film is dreary, and the acting not especially good.  Admittedly, the movie attempts to recreate a very large book, showing only the first half of the book in this film, which is a big part of the problem - the movie has no ending, no climax, no closure, and no point.

The colors don't resolve very well on the screen and it looks like the copy is muddy or murky.  I'm told it plays like this in the theater as well so it's not the dvd copy, which I thought at first, but for some reason they skimped on the cgi.  Which seems odd.

HP and the Deathy Hallows, Part 1 has slowed down a bit to let you catch up with the characters. Being a ""part 1"" there is a lot more exposition than the last 4 films: These characters have grown up and changed, the audience needs to catch up with the Harry,Ronald, Hermoine trio before that final conflict.  The screenwriter, as always, did a marvelous job of capturing the feel of the book and compressing it into length of this film.<br /><br />The dvd/blu-ray itself is just fine.

This Harry Potter film really showed me that Lord Voldemort is totally evil & the fact that Harry, Hermoine & Ron are overall on there own on what they have to do. Since the death of Dumbledore things have been really different for Harry, Hermoine & Ron. I don't think that just because it is a Harry Potter film doesn't necessarily mean the film has to be filled with tons of action. This film had a bunch of dialogue and plot in my opinion. There didn't have to be a ton of action in this movie for there to be a good story. Which this film did tell a good story.

Of course, the storyline has matured along with the actors.<br /><br />The Harry Potter series is all about dark, mysterious, magical things. Hence, some of the scenes in this movie are in the dark woods, in dark castles, etc. The scenes are not bad, too dark, etc. It's suppose to be that way. It falls right in with the script/storyline. Some of the sound effects do drown out the speech and you can't hear what's being said, but you get the gist. This movie is fast-paced, and is full of action and mystery. You get more info about the characters, and there are a few new elements. I enjoyed the background story about the Deathly Hallow men. The characters warping in and out reminds me of ""Inception"", but it works well.<br /><br />This movie has a bit more violence, sensuality, tragedy, and death than the others did.

4942977,B004WMKSH2, A34GZPHWYPSY2T,4.0, Muggles Need Not Apply,"**THIS HAS MAJOR SPOILERS (LIKE I CARE!)**<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS - PART 1 (2010) is a great warts-and-all film. How ironic, since it is about witches and wizards. My original review, though almost all here, is scrapped in favor of kicking off complaining about Daniel Radcliffe. He can act, certainly, but in this film he's more than flat. Frustration and angst is the character's hallmark, but the days of a sometimes sweet and charming Harry are days long gone. Be aware of that and beware Radcliffe's unforgivable failures as a young adult actor.<br /><br />This is a very skillful adaptation of novel-to-script, and let no one dispute that fact.<br /><br />The kids (Daniel Radcliffe in spite of it all, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson) are a delight, a true delight! How they've grown, yet they remain themselves.<br /><br />This film's power is mostly in its gloomy silence. Andr&eacute; Desplat's soundtrack, as thin as wispy mountain air, is nonetheless brilliant. Also, Yates handled the disgusting scenes very well. He had to put them in - Rowling wrote it that way, didn't she? I believe Yates split the story - that is, brought Part I to its end - at the perfect moment. I wondered where they'd split it.<br /><br />Now the BAD:<br /><br />The others in this film are a bit on the cardboard site. One expects better, though the acting (such as it is) is great. If you do not blink, otherwise you'll miss it. It angered me that Rufus Scrimegeour (Bill Nighy) was not introduced in the last film as he ought to have been, and here he appears for all of exactly five minutes, including a full minute-plus in the opening scene. This was saved only by the fact that Bill Nighy is as great as ever.<br /><br />What I did love about Scrimegeour was his speech, that opens the film. It was straight from Margaret Thatcher and would have done the old lady proud. I thought it was deeply moving yet hilarious; English audiences will instantly perceive it but I doubt it will have any impact on the American viewer.<br /><br />While I myself cannot tell whether Scrimegeour is talking with a Welsh or Scots accent, it is a precise growl that grabs your attention no matter what. (He says, ""deluminator-r-r-r"" with a velvety purr.) The whole character is reminiscent of the character's name: it is a Scots name and has its own tartan, but it is a sept of a larger clan name. This is the kind of depth you can expect from these great actors, given what little they've got with which to work here.<br /><br />Further, the film sags horribly during its central 40 minutes. Bad, especially after its genius beginning and follow-through. It was intended to do that, but I think it was 40 minutes totally wasted.<br /><br />Oh, now give me a break: Indo-Chinese style shadow puppets to tell the story of the Three Brothers? How unnecessarily cheap Yates can be! They do better than this with crummy historical reenactments in documentaries. And how he skimped on the magic - a fate Roger Ebert tellingly prophesied almost ten years ago.<br /><br />There were disgusting moments that, although I can see as necessary, really should have been re-written for younger viewers. That's just me. Otherwise, there's nothing else. I LOVED this film and wish that the POTTER craze had used a bit more of Yates' tricks in the past. Impossible, but I wish it. Someone said this is ""the most cinematically satisfying"" of all the films. Agreed, but only to a degree.<br /><br />WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO SEE AND WAS COMPLETELY IGNORED: Harry and Hermione seeing the ""Potter Memorials"" in Godric's Hollow. A bit more dialogue might have helped.<br /><br />WHAT I REALLY LOVED SEEING (ALMOST AS MUCH AS HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE): Domhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasely. He's a handsome redhead and I wish they'd shown more.<br /><br />PAY ATTENTION: I will only ever explain this once and tough toenails if you think it spoils anything. It is about the wands. Dumbledore of course owns the Elder Wand. Draco disarmed Dumbledore at the tower before Dumbledore died, so the Elder Wand belonged to Draco. Note: one does not need to take the actual wand or fight against it to defeat its master.<br /><br />Therein lies the trick: when Harry disarms Draco of some paltry wands at the Malfoy mansion (shown vividly here), Harry becomes the Elder Wand master. So the fact that Dumbledore is buried with it, and Voldemort steals it, is of no consequence. Harry is still its master as soon as he beats Draco by disarming him.<br /><br />Ending: Voldemort cannot kill Harry with the Elder Wand stolen from Dumbledore's tomb: the wand recognizes its true master. However, he does stun the part of himself that lives in Harry. When Harry awakens, all he has to do then is defend himself and let Voldemort kill himself with his own Avada Kedavra curse. See? Simple.<br /><br />Get this film, no question about that. I hear the Blu-Ray or whatever it's called has terrific extras, which the single, plain-jane DVD does not. The single edition only has deleted scenes, and not nearly as much footage as I expected.<br /><br />DVD COMPLAINING: We were cheated with the plain single DVD for some reason. It has some deleted scenes and there was a lot of smoke and mirrors about what extras would be on the single edition. Remember, this is the arm-twisting that will force us all sooner or later to get Blu-Ray. That angers me more than Warner Brother's habitual broken promises and lies.<br /><br />Yes, there is a double-disc plain DVD edition because we considered it before just getting the single plain one. I'm tired of the almost-100% lame quality of POTTER extras. It's just that there is so much more and apparently the Blu-Ray special is a 3-disc. See? The air is full of rip-offs!<br /><br />We didn't get our single edition at W**~M*** but they did have the double plain DVD edition there ... where was that ... T**** I think.<br /><br />And yes, WB should be FINED for their habitual lies, bait-n-switch and broken promises. This is the beginning of the forced move to Blu-Ray.<br /><br />One day, no regular DVDs will be seen anywhere.<br /><br />For all the negatives, I demerit one star. For Warner Brothers/DVD distributor in America, I give the biggest raspberry in the universe!!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942981,B004WMKSH2, A28OB1QLXN5BM6,5.0, Three Generations Of My Family LOVED This Film,"I was lucky enough to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 with three generations of Harry Potter fans:  my mother, my sister, and my 18 year old nephew (who shall remain nameless since he deigned to be seen in public with three older women in his family!).  All four of us really, really enjoyed the film, and we had a great time discussing it afterwards.  All of us agreed that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best adaptation, truest to the novel, in quite sometime.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the first part of the final Harry Potter novel of the same name.  The Death Eaters are taking over, and Volemort is back in power.  The wizarding world is still reeling from the death of Dumbledore, and Harry Potter is essentially public enemy number one.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are on the run and looking the remaining horcruxes.  If Harry can destroy all the remaining horcuxes, he will finally have a chance of destroying Voldemort for good.<br /><br />My nephew stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best screen play adaptation of a Harry Potter novel to date, and the rest of my family agrees.  While none of us believe that you can go into this movie cold, without having read the books or seen the previous 6 films, we all agree that if you are a fan, you will love this movie.  This book was one of my favorites of the series, and the film version is right up there for me, too. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint continue to delight us as Harry, Hermione, Ron.  These actors perfectly portray these three beloved and endearing characters, and I, for one, can't imagine Harry, Hermione, and Ron any other way.  These kids have grown up on the screen, their talent developed and matured, and I have enjoyed their journey.  Rupert Grint is especially notable in his jelous, horcrux-induced rage, and the ""dream scene"" between Harry and Hermione is well done, and quite uncomfortable (as it should be).  Some of the scenery is stunning, as well as quite atmospheric.  The long shots of the deep woods and empty plains expertly conveyed a true sense of cold, longing, defeat, and loneliness.  The emotions of this film run high, as friends are injured and some die.  And of course, there is a cliff hanger ending, since this is only the first half of the final book.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 does exactly what it needs to do:  whets our appetites for the final installments  I know I can't wait until July.  The final movie promises to be the best yet.<br /><br />Side note:  As we were driving to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, it occured to me that my nephew was about 9 years old when the first film openned, and now he is 18 and driving US to this film.  He and a whole generation of kids really have grown up with the Harry Potter books and movies.  It is wonderful to see that even after all this time, Harry Potter still captures the hearts and imaginations of millions of children of ALL ages.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942984,B004WMKSH2, A3UFEIO8UXOAZW,4.0," The movie is supposed to be dark, not washed-out!","Amazon tends to lump the reviews for all the different versions of the product together. This review is for the DVD version.<br /><br />The movie is fine and the audio is great, but the video transfer is absolutely the worst I have ever seen. Or, not seen, if you catch my drift: even with the lights out at night in a perfectly dark room, the first 1/3 of the movie is completely unwatchable. It's not just that the movie is dark, it's that the movie is lacking any sort of brightness at all.<br /><br />On my TV, the movie looks like it was shot in dense, black fog. I was keenly disappointed, since the deleted scenes looked fine.<br /><br />I have a Panasonic plasma TV and a Sony DVD player. Neither piece of equipment could be considered cheap or low-end. The difference between the picture and anything else I have ever put into the DVD player is like, er, night and day.<br /><br />I played around with the menus on the DVD player, and could not find any unusual settings. And although I performed some experiments (turning progressive mode off, fiddling with the black level, and the cinema modes), nothing I did made any real improvement to the picture.<br /><br />Since not everyone who bought this item is complaining about the poor video quality (although quite a few people are), I'm not sure if this is a quality control issue, or if the studio made some technical decisions about how to compress the video that only show up on certain players and TVs. You would think that Warner's would know what it is doing. Presumably, so does Sony, who invented the DVD format (along with Phillips).<br /><br />I put the disk into the DVD drive on my desktop computer, and the picture looked fine. The movie was dark, but you could see what was going on. I suppose I can watch the rest of the movie that way. My computer monitor is significantly smaller than my TV, but at least I can enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps the title of the review should have been, ""Are You Feeling Lucky?"" Because it's going to take a bit of luck on your part to get a DVD that's actually watchable. Judging from the other reviews, about 10 to 15% of us are having problems watching this DVD.<br /><br />p.s., the real ""extras"" on this disk are the interminable parade of ads for other HP products you are forced to wade through before you can arrive at the main menu.<br /><br />UPDATE: The fact that the disk played tolerably well on my computer led me to suspect that (gasp!) my TV might need adjusting. I had several DVDs in my video library that included the TXH optimizer, which is probably the simplest way to check your TV setup. Sure enough, the Picture/Contrast setting was too low, and the Brightness was so poor, I couldn't even begin to make the necessary adjustment!<br /><br />Some scouring on the internet got me the secret formula for entering Service Mode on my Panasonic TV. I found the menu for brightness, and boosted things until I could actually see the TXH drop shadow. Once I exited the service menu, I had to tweak the Black setting on the TV, and then I was able to finish the THX optimizer adjustments, including color and tint (you'll be needing special blue glasses for this last step, order them from the TXH consumer web page).<br /><br />Bottom line: it was my TV, not the disk.<br /><br />However, it would have been a lot easier all around if Warner's had included a test screen on the DVD. They wouldn't have had to include the TXH optimizer (I'm sure there's some sort of licencing fee invoved), but they could have had a test pattern that said something to the effect of, ""if you don't see all ten levels of black on the next screen, you need to adjust your set!""<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this was the ONLY DVD I've found to be too dark. But everything is better now, and I've adjusted my rating accordingly.<br /><br />p.s., THX has a list of DVDs that include the THX optimizer. Search the internet and you will find them. One of my favorites is ""Tombstone."" Another is ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"". The entire Indiana Jones series includes them, as do quite a few titles from Anchor Bay. Chances are, you already have one or more of them in your DVD collection. If this disk is too dark on your TV, it's probably time to adjust your set!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4942985,B004WMKSH2, AZB81NQF9W5A8,5.0, Amazing!,"This movie follows the book really well. Before it came to theaters, I was wondering, ""Where are they going to cut this movie in half?"" The ending did seem a little abrupt, but I thought it was a good place to end it. I laughed, I cried (Yes, I literally balled my eyes out in the theater. So did my mom, and she's never read the books or watched the previous movies). She said that it was a little hard to follow because she hadn't read or seen Harry Potter before, but there's not much they can do to backtrack and explain everything or else you'd end up with a movie that's 10 hours long.

4942986,B004WMKSH2, A5EKUC02QJKWE,5.0," Not only the best Harry Potter film in the franchise, but also a perfect example of smart young adult entertainment.","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 has the feel of a post-apocalyptic film, as certain scenes draw visual comparisons to the harrowing film The Road with Viggo Mortensen. I am very biased since I grew up reading Harry Potter and I feel I have an allegiance to the material that cannot be broken by any means, which basically implies that this review may not be helpful to people who are non-fans. I am a lover of film and noticed this installment's shortcomings; it had a few. There were some editing mistakes I caught onto in a variety of scenes and certain obscurities in the script. However, these were only mild shortcomings, because the film delivered in almost every other respect. For one thing, director David Yates has developed and has almost mastered his craft as a filmmaker. I remember looking back to his debut film Order of the Phoenix, and observing his shaky work. I really enjoyed that HP film, but I felt as though Yates was failing to take the risks necessary to make an epic fantasy film. His choice of camera angles and shots were too self-contained and his lack of establishing shots and scenes was very apparent. In Half-Blood Prince, it was obvious Yates was beginning to realize the artistic appeal of the series, becoming more focused on delivering an emotionally dense and visually rich summer blockbuster rather than just another daft and forgettable special-effects extravaganza. HBP was a huge step in the right direction, even though I felt that the film's major shortcoming was in its inability to render palpable performances from the younger cast. This was probably due to Yates's orders from producers to go in a more ""romcom"" direction to compete with the uncomparable and lesser Twilight. It was obvious Yates's strong suit was in directing dramatic scenes, not tender, romantic ones.  Regardless, the film delivered and payed respect to the overall spririt of Rowling's work.<br /><br />However, now, in Deathly Hallows, Yates delivers in more ways than one. For one thing, he creates a film that does not feel like any of its predecessors: it is dark, gritty, and intense. The characters are no longer in the safe haven that is Hogwarts, they are on the run and keeping out of sight from the evil Lord Voldemort and his loyal minions. In the process, they have to find objects containing pieces of Voldemort's soul and destroy them; but they have no one to guide them and only the late Dumbledore's hunch to direct their journey. Many critics and audiences alike complained that the film began very well (showcasing an intense action sequence where an army of Death Eaters chase after Harry and his friends in flight), but then began to drag toward the second act. I completely disagree. If you call allowing a movie time for some breathing room, dragging, then our society really has lost its ability to engage in meaningful entertainment. The second act of the film, though slow-paced, showcases not only the acting talents of the main trio, but also demonstrates how strong their friendship is. No other Harry Potter film has had sufficient time to explore these relationships and character dynamics. Yates even allows room for sexual tension to build up between Harry and Hermione, which adds a unique layer to this movie, and gives audiences a lot to speculate about.<br /><br />Technically, like Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows Part 1 delivers. I am surprised it did not at least get nominated for Best Cinematography. Eduardo Serra's ability to measure the camerawork so that it is shaky enough when it needs to be yet subtle when it is essential, is unparalleled; and Yates's decision to work with Serra makes me respect him even more, because it is obvious Yates is an experimental filmmaker, and he will work with a crew that will help present a vision that is true to the source material. Each of his HP adaptations have had a uniformity in their own right, and each one seems so different. Even technically, there are major differences between Ootp, HBP, and DH Part 1. Just observe the color palettes, the cinematography, the art direction, and the framing. DH is so great because Yates has realized that Rowling's story is about young adults who understand the pangs and experiences of any of us muggles. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are not caricatures of real people; they represent real people, exhibiting emotions that are universal. As a result, the visual style of DH Part 1 is very gritty and immersive, allowing us--the audience--to observe the magical, relevant, and relatable themes occuring on the screen, presented in a way in that the magical world of Harry Potter seems not so different from our own.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4942989,B004WMKSH2, AUEHG0DB54B7K,5.0, The Dark Before the Dawn,"I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and so look at each of the films without knowing how they were adapted from page to screen.  As with any adaptation, there will be parts of the story that are changed or removed.  Part one of the final film is quite dark as Voldemort's power dominates the wizarding world. Harry, Ron and Hermione vow to find and destroy all of the Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort but they have little idea how to accomplish this.<br /><br />The film follows the battle between the forces of good and evil with evil winning. There are systematic efforts to get rid of wizards that do not agree with Voldemort's notions of pure blood.  Dumbledoor's supports are hunted down.  There are broadcasts where the names of captured or killed wizards are announced. The lack of hope pervades the film as Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced to hide in remote places. The locations chosen for their hiding places were visually stunning.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe turns in a good performance as does Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who shows a broader range of emotions in this film.  This film centers more on the characters of the three central wizards and they carry off the film very well.  They are supported by a host of British actors that mostly make very brief appearances. Bill Nighly has a brief part as Rufus Scrimgeour, but it is a pivotal one as he provides Harry, Ron and Hermione with items that can help them find the Horcruxes.  Imelda Staunton briefly reprises her role as Dolores Umbridge.  Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Isaacs were, as always, very good being evil.  In addition, Dobby makes a substantial appearance again appearing to help Harry in his time of need. The animation of Dobby (and the elf Kreecher) was much more life like than I recall from previous films.<br /><br />I did find that the film was a bit slow as Harry, Hermione and Ron hide out trying to discover what to do next.  These scenes added to the tense atmosphere of the film but were too long.  The suggestion was made by one reviewer that the movie is following the book on this point but on screen, it didn't quite work for me.  On the other hand, the scene where polyjuice is used to create multiple Potters is one of the delights of the film and adds a bit of humor to the serious trouble Harry is in.  I thought the animation that told the story of the Deathly Hallows was well done. The music by Alexander Desplait very much added to the mood of the film.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

It moves much faster, the dangers seem far greater, and everything is at stake.  This is even character development, with Ron rebelling and coming back, the progress of young love, and Harry's flaws coming out more clearly.

4943004,B004WMKSH2, A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,2.0, Time-marking entry in the series,"**1/2<br /><br />In ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" the penultimate entry in the decade-long ""Harry Potter"" movie series (it covers only one-half of the final novel with the second half due out at a later time), things are going from bad to worse for our intrepid little band of wand-waving heroes and the people who have taught and raised them.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is running for his life from the evil Lord Voldemort, who's made it his life's mission to personally finish off the young lad, and the Ministry of Magic has been taken over by Death Eaters, who have begun a wave of persecution against all Muggle-born witches and wizards.<br /><br />For those who are diehard devotees of the ""Potter"" series and who have literally grown up with these characters, watching ""Deathly Hallows"" must feel a bit like going to the prom in the run-up to senior graduation (an apt comparison since Harry, Hermione and Ron are now all well into their adolescence with all the teen-drama and angst that that inevitably entails).  For those of us who are but casual observers of the tales, the movie feels muddled and poky, its storytelling much too esoteric and confusing and its pacing much too slow.  The latter may be attributed to the fact that this is only one-half of the story, with the promise of a tighter resolution to come in the final installment.  Still, that doesn't make sitting through this film any more palatable or entertaining.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The Sword of Gryffindor scene was exactly how I pictured it when I read the book, same for the scenes in the Ministry of Magic. The most disappointing scene for me, was the imprisonment at Malfoy manor. It could've been much better in my opinion. But I understand it's still considered a kids film.<br /><br />I still think they did a good job, but I wasn't as 'hyped' about HP7: Part1, as I was with the other previous films.

4943015,B004WMKSH2, A38G3H3KLQ4HL,5.0, Worth waiting 10 years for,"Can I just say that Rupert Grint is swiftly becoming one of my favorite actors? Because somehow even cheesy lines sound good coming from him. I think Ron's the most relatable character, especially when his strengths are taking a backseat to his emotions. You never realize how important he is to the trio until this one. He's sort of the nucleus by simply being there for Hermione to shout at and afterward making her laugh and Harry to vent his frustration to without having to apologize. To see Hermione and Harry alone for a little bit reveals just how awkward it is to be with each other without him.<br /><br />You can really feel the frustration of the characters. This is noticeable when they try to figure out how to destroy the horocrux. Ron is kinda the common sense one of the group and simply voices what Harry and Hermione (not to mention the audience) are thinking: Why didn't Dumbledore tell him how to destroy it?<br /><br />I think during the woods and camping scenes (particularly the horocrux scene) you can really see the problems of the trio's friendship; on one hand, they need and can trust only each other and on the other, they're just sick of being together. They fight amongst themselves while fighting for their lives- brilliant. Of course, they overcome their disagreements and band together but the journey is intense, perilous and extremely lonely.<br /><br />I don't really know why someone wouldn't like this film. If their complaint is about the buildup, then they must hate the HP series because ALL of the movies are a buildup to the final film. Granted, this one is a little more irritating because you just want to see how it ends. And having never read the books, I'm excited to see the action.<br /><br />EDIT: I've noticed alot of people have said that it was boring, but here's the thing: everything in this film is necessary so that the PART 2 makes sense; the woods scene may be boring, but it's to show the psyche of what the characters are going through. Not every scene in Harry Potter has to take place in Hogwarts or Harry's home. This is the darkest because of the *feelings* that are eminating from three teenagers on an extremely dangerous mission. Did everyone really think that everything would be pretty and nice as long as they stayed at Hogwarts?",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943016,B004WMKSH2, A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,4.0," A few flaws, but overall a fantastic film","As a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter books, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie very much, although a few things about the film could have been better.<br /><br />The best thing about ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is that the producers were smart enough to split the final installment of J.K. Rowling's brilliant wizard saga into two films. As a result, not nearly as much content from the book was cut for Part I of ""Deathly Hallows"" as has been the case with the other HP movies. The book chronicles Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they decide to abandon their final year of education at Hogwarts and set off on a quest to take down the evil Lord Voldemort. What begins as a search for Voldemort's horcruxes also turns into a hunt for the three mysterious Deathly Hallows, along with a struggle for survival.<br /><br />This is a very dark and intense film, and rightfully so, as the seventh book in the HP series is the most grim of all. The filmmakers got a lot of things right, but there were a few disappointments. (Note: a few spoilers are ahead.) I understand the need to omit material from movies to meet time requirements, and I even understand the desire to make small alterations so certain things translate better from page to screen. However, changing things just for the sake of changing them really irritates me. One thing that really disappointed me was the sequence where Harry is taken away from the Dursley residence, and a bunch of Harry Potters undergo an airborne attack by Death Eaters. That scene was way too short in the film, and for some reason half of it took place in the middle of a busy London street, which made no sense at all. Hedwig's death was also rewritten a bit, and in my opinion it happened way too fast and didn't do the poor owl justice. (At least the Dobby death scene was much better.)<br /><br />I also wasn't happy that the film added some scenes that weren't in the book at all. This takes away from an opportunity to showcase more of the original plot from the novel. Why, for instance, include that stupid scene with Harry and Hermione dancing in the tent and cut the Harry/Lupin fight that occurs in Grimmauld Place? Most of the scenes that were new to the movie easily could have been omitted in favor of Rowling's original material.<br /><br />In spite of those shortcomings, however. this is truly an excellent film. It was made for fans of the books, so critics who blast the film for being too long and dragging in the beginning obviously have no idea what they're talking about. The cast is amazing, the effects are phenomenal, and you REALLY need to see this movie in the theatre. I cannot wait to see the final movie next spring.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943017,B004WMKSH2, A2WSATQ1L3LXIO,1.0," The movie is good, the DVD is terrible",I am watching this DVD as I write.  So far we are 20 minutes in and have not gotten to the main menu yet.  I don't need to see Four Video Game commercials and a documntary about a theme park.  I will never buy another WB DVD ever again.  I PAID for this?  Commercials?  No thank you.  Ditch all the junk and give us some extras.,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943018,B004WMKSH2, AQQBRDQ2QJOO8,2.0, Probably more fun for those who like extended camping sequences,"This is the movie that adapts the first half of the dullest and dreariest of the series of books by J.K. Rowling. (Not the longest book, nor the book with the most events, but I'm sure Warner Brothers is now kicking themselves and wishing they'd started splitting these back at Azkaban to make twice as much money.)<br /><br />I haven't changed my opinion of the book -- which is, by far, the worst of the series, with a sag in the middle like a couch that Hagrid just sat on -- and the movie is as deeply faithful to the book in the way that this series of movies always has been...and that means, of course, that it's full of dull, dreary camping sequences, in which Harry, Ron, and Hermoine mope at each other for what feels like the full eight months the book covers.<br /><br />(Somewhere in the middle of that, my younger son quietly stated that he wasn't having any fun and went up to his room to play. When your movie isn't more entertaining than playing alone with dominoes, you've got a serious problem.)<br /><br />The plot makes as much sense here as it did in the book: which is to say, it's still the quintessentially English story about a boy who definitely isn't too smart for his station, but is indomitable enough to muddle through because his heart is true. Rowling has no interest in a resistance movement against her magical dictator, nor does she care about what's happening to the UK under Voldemort (much less the rest of the world, which nearly doesn't exist in the Harry Potter world), or even in depicting Harry Potter as any kind of leader or competent hero.<br /><br />No, instead Deathly Hallows 1 is the story of three friends (who hate each other) hiding out in the woods instead of trying to find the seven magical [Plot Coupons] Horcruxes, which they need (along with three pounds fifty in coins) to send off to Rowling for an ending. And this movie doesn't even get them to the point where they actually start to accomplish their quest, so it's entirely ominous beginning and dreary middle. This is the movie you have to get through to get Deathly Hallows 2, and you'd have to be a stone Potter fan -- the kind unwilling to admit anything connected to Rowling is less than fabulous -- to strongly enjoy it as a movie in its own right.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943019,B004WMKSH2, A2INCRDI6OWA4C,3.0, Just Okay,"Having watched all of the previous Harry Potter movies and read all of the books I am not impressed with this movie.  The fist five movies were very good, but the Half Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows felt very different.  The Deathly Hallows, Part 1 consisted of random scenes splashed together with seemingly no flow to it.  Coupled with Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) mediocre performance, this film is a mess.  With regards to the story, this is a very depressing time for Harry and his friends, but Radcliffe displayed almost no emotion during the entire film.  It's understandable that Harry and his friends would be a bit moody, but there was no passion in Harry's voice, especially for what he and his friends had sacrificed to find the horcruxes (Hermoine was on par and Ron was good as always though).  For example, when Harry was asked if it felt better to take one of the horcruxes from around his neck he quickly said to Hermione ""Loads.""  I didn't sense that his character felt any better for having it away from him because of how he delivered the line.  There was no weight to that scene, and that was not the only one.  Most of the time, Harry just sat there in uncomfortable silence when he was asked a question or spoken to.  I felt myself hoping the characters got through the scenes without messing up their lines.<br /><br />There was an awkward dancing scene along with awkward kissing scenes that added nothing to the film.  For example, Ginny shows up out of no where, Harry and her make out and then that's it...nothing else is spoken about their relationship or anything from the book.  Don't even get me started about the scene with the obviously computer generated half naked Hermoine and Harry walking toward Ron while he is trying to destroy the horcrux....weird!  Strange kissing scene ensues  My last upsetting issue was regarding the dark mood and some of the disturbing scenes (beware parents, I'm sure this movie will give the little ones nightmares - I will not let mine watch this one).  The dark mood is awkwardly peeled away at certain points to let in misplaced humor (noteably by Fred and George).  The Harry Potter series has lost it's fun feel and gone dark big time.  Not really a fan of that change, but I know the story has changed and things are not as they were.  Personally I blame Rowling locking herself up away from her family to write the final Harry Potter books (may or may not be true).  I heard that somewhere and I think that her isolation from her family didn't make for the best material for this book.<br /><br />This is not a bash Radcliffe session as there were others to blame.  Ultimately I blame the director as he could have made the scenes better, especially with transitioning them better.  While I am on the subject and bashing away, let me throw this in.  I say fire the current Harry and replace him with Frodo from Lord of the Rings for the final part 2.  It's easy to explain, Harry did a face changing spell that backfired and is now permanent.  Also, fire the director and get someone talented in there, not one of these dime a dozen ones.  That's my take and I hope you enjoyed it.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943023,B004WMKSH2, A2U80IPZXN5V1U,4.0, The first part of the series' epic conclusion...,"Technically it's half of a movie but I really feel that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 stands on its own as an excellent HP film. While I really like it I probably wouldn't consider it to be the best HP movie but I quite enjoy it, some of the character's emotions come out really well here. For those who have not read J.K. Rowling's seventh and final book in the series the action may seem slow and it may seem a bit boring but this Part 1 was necessary. Not everyone will see the beauty of this 7th Potter film but I think splitting the final film in two was a great decision, of course money-wise it was a very good idea for Warner Bros profitable to do so. It also allows viewers a more complete visual experience of the book. Contrary to what some may think I feel that splitting the final book into two movies was for the best because it gives more room for character emotion, ambiance and best of all, it doesn't rush things. I must say the action is a bit slower and Hogwarts is missed but Part 1 sets things up nicely for the conclusion of the Harry potter saga on movies. Everything that needed to be in this movie was and they didn't cut out much. As for the acting I don't think the actors have ever been better in a Harry Potter movie their performances here were nothing short of excellent and brilliant. I won't go through the storyline or the events of the movie, this should be clear by now and I don't think there is much more to say, basically Harry, Hermione and Ron search for the missing horcruxes. I don't want to spoil anything or reveal too much but I just want to say that one of my favorite parts was the animation showed for the story of the three brother in ""The Tales of Beetle the Bard"". It looked fantastic visually and even if brief is I feel, a highlight of Part 1.<br /><br />For the Blu-Ray: The special features are Blu-Ray exclusive, now I don't know why that is. Perhaps Warner thought that those buying the DVD version (which is a LOT) wouldn't like to have bonus features for some reason. The Blu-Ray has a disc devoted to special features only, the extras are a nice touch for fans and I did like them. For instance the 7 Harrys feature was pretty cool and I liked watching the deleted scenes but I probably won't watch the bonuses very often. The digital copy is not on a disc, it's an online download and from what other reviewers are saying it's not ideal because of software download, unwanted software and it isn't the ""safest"" download, let's put it at that. I would've rather had the digital copy on a disc like much of the other Blu releases but that's just a minor complaint.<br /><br />There are many complaints about the picture quality, especially for the DVD. I own the Blu-Ray/Digital Copy/DVD combo version of Deathly Hallows and I have to admit that these are definitely not the best Blu-Ray or DVD that I've seen. I watched both formats and I think the Blu-Ray looks better in comparison the very dark picture that you get with the DVD. I watched the movie in theaters when it was released and I don't remember it to be this dark. I don't know what it is but Warner Bros managed to screw up the picture quality for this movie, perhaps this will be corrected in the not too distant future with a boxed set of the 8 movies?<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows; it's a nice addition to the series and set the viewers for what should be a fantastic conclusion. It's hard to believe 2011 marks the 10 year anniversary of the first movie and the franchise! I can't wait to see Part 2 as I think Part 1 set us up so nicely for it! Now, as much as I love the movie I can't give this Blu-Ray/DVD release 5 star because of the picture transfer but those who are not too preoccupied by the darker picture quality should still go for it.4/5 stars, minus 1 star for the visuals.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943026,B004WMKSH2, AGDC6Q4MAGQCR,5.0, Left Speechless,"Despite being a loyal Harry Potter fan I definitely was left disappointed by the films. Many of worthy parts were ommitted while some could've been done without. This movie alone was closer to the book than all 6 prior movies combined. To all hating reviews, I am aware of the lack of action and all the walking, but anyone who read the book I imagine would be as thrilled as I was.

4943027,B004WMKSH2, A2NF1RY31JF0HE,5.0, An example of how a film improved upon a book,"The 7th movie in this series is the best so far and the best adaptation from the book to the movies by a landslide.<br /><br />I found that the book moved extremely slow and had the characters parked in certain locations for months. I thought that this diminished the dangers they faced, the enlongated time in the book took away the tension. Also I thought with so much time gone by, couldn't they have come up with a better plan. Couldn't the Order of the Pheonix be doing the job that these three kids are doing? What are they doing during this time? The other good wizards seem to sit and wait to be picked off. It made no sense.<br /><br />The movie condensed the book timeframe and translated what took months in the book to seem like days in the film. I think this definately turned up the tension. In the film I felt these kids were constantly in danger and thus didn't have the time to formulate a clear plan. It made the risky decisions they made more plausable to me. It also made the absence of communication or action by the ""good"" wizards of the order of the Pheonix more understandable. I understand that the people who read the books want every detail in the films, but a lot of what was cut would make a very rocky translation to film (it just wouldn't work).<br /><br />After the first two movies of this series I really felt the screenwriter really got in a groove of how to translate this series. With the sheer number of characters, creatures, objects, and locations in this series they really did a great job of streamlining it and giving all these elements meaningful screentime. The Harry Potter film series is really amazing in how they were able to fill the roles with quality actors and retain those actors for a decade (the only exception was the original actor who played Dumbledore died after the second film). How lucky were they that they cast three children that grew into very capable actors and didn't have the ""Disney children melt downs"" that so many instantly famous children seem to do. Warner Brothers really did the Harry Potter film series right, a rarity in Hollywood really. Look what Lucas did to the Star War movies, yikes! Imagine if Steven Spielberg had got his way and combined the first two Harry Potter books into one movie (Thank goodness Spielberg never touched these movies!). All of the filmmakers they hired to direct parts 3 through 8 were perfect matches for the entry they made. Keeping the same screenwriter had a lot to do with the quality of this series (and the fact they kept Rowling involved through the whole adaptation too!) So bravo to Warner Brothers for getting something right!<br /><br />The fact of the matter is this film sets up the last film, and if part one is any indication I think they are going to knock part 2 out of the park. For all those claiming this movie did not have enough action, just wait. Knowing what's ahead, I think almost the entire second film will be high stakes action and based on what I've seen I bet the last film will be better than the second half of the last book too!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943028,B004WMKSH2, A168VXSISJWQN9,4.0, All I expected of Part 1,"I think director David Yates did as much with the material as could be expected. He got their best performances yet from the three stars, there was a little more humor than in the book (very welcome) and the outdoor locations were imaginative and in some cases majestic. All the vital plot ingredients were there to prepare viewers for the grand finale in part 2. Having said that, I found this an unsatisfying movie just because I wanted to see Part 2 immediately, not in 8 months' time. It's not that I don't know what happens, it's just that the first part of the movie resolves nothing. Once we see Part 2, it will be possible to pass a judgement on the whole. This instalment was good, but rather like trying to rate a meal when all you've had is the appetizer.<br /><br />A warning: as is apparent from other reviews, this movie even more than the others relies on the viewer knowing the story in some detail before watching it. If you are a Harry Potter fan (like me), no problem. If you haven't got a good knowledge of the story so far, either bring yourself up to date with it up to the end of book/movie #6, or don't waste your time watching this one. It won't mean a thing to you.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943029,B004WMKSH2, A27OBJA1YDQFZI,5.0, Bleakly brilliant,"Other reviewers have stressed the importance of doing some background homework before seeing this movie.  That's because the film, while making sense to people who've seen the others and read the books, won't to those who haven't.  Even if you are a diehard Harry fan, you'll probably have your own opinions about what ought to have been included, and what wasn't.  You may feel that some characters deserved more screen time and more of a backstory. But you'll probably agree that the second-to-last movie in the ""Harry"" series does a more than competent job of adapting the (unwieldy plotwise) book.<br /><br />If you're going in cold, you may wonder things like, ""What the heck is Horcrux?""  ""Why aren't the kids still in school?""  ""Who are all these characters that only get a few minutes of screen time and disappear without any real explanation?"" and so on.  Well, the kids have decided not to return to school after Headmaster Dumbledore's death in the last movie.  A Horcrux is a piece of soul, and Voldemort has figured out a way to split himself into seven different ones. Before the final showdown with Voldy, Harry must recover all these Horcruxes. That's why he goes on that camping trip with just his two pals.  Harry also has a telepathic connection with Voldy (again not explained) which allows him to be suddenly plunged into Voldy's memory.  That accounts for some of the odd flashbacks.<br /><br />For most of the movie, Harry, Hermione and Ron are on their own, dodging the frequent magic hurled at them by Voldemort's crew, while searching for Horcruxes and trying to decipher why Dumbledore left them each a gift in his will. Most of the major characters from the previous films (who haven't died) pop in for an appearance including Alan Rickman as the nefarious Severus Snape; Imelda Stanton as former Hogwart's Headmistress who now holds a position in the Ministry of Magic; and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Harry's nemesis who has also been forced to grow up rather fast. Ralph Fiennes plays Voldemort capably as usual, but the villian who looks like she's having the most fun is Helena Bonham Carter, as Bellatrix.  (Sadly, there is no Neville, but I expect we'll see him in the next film.)<br /><br />You could argue that so much of the movie is unrelentingly bleak, spends too much time on the Great Camping Trip, etc., but all these things can also be said of the book it's based on.  I, for one, felt a bit cheated at having to wait for yet another film, but to be fair, I don't see how the book would be better as a single film. So I'd recommend it anyway.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943030,B004WMKSH2, ACJVGDN8G386P,5.0, HP Films Keep Ascending the Magical Ladder of Storytellng Classic,"It's hard to believe we've now been living with Harry Potter for going on 12 years for Americans, and 13 years if you're British since the first book was published in the UK as ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" in 1997 and ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" in the US in 1998. In the first installment of the last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I, the entire Harry Potter enterprise has literally come-of-age. The story and characters have matured along with the writer, her readers/film-goers, as well as the actors in the primary roles. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Daniel Radcliffe in the roles of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter have grown up along with their youthful wizards, and the actors themselves are fast-earning the right to be regarded as A-list talent. Hopefully, they will have fine careers ahead of them, assuming they won't be forever type-cast as the Hogwarts wizard students of the Harry Potter novels. And of course, the ultimate credit of the series belongs to J.K. Rowling who has created a universe as recognizable as JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth, Stephen King's Dark Tower, and Anne Rice's 18th and 19th-century vampire societies.<br /><br />The rest of the cast of ""HP and the Deathly Hallows"", aside from the young leads, comprises bona fide A-list actors who were already demonstrating the heights of their craft long before J.K. Rowling was penning Harry Potter in tea shops as a single mother on welfare in Britain. Ironically, the names topping the list play the villains and dark characters: Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. Special recognition has to be paid to Fiennes as Voldemort whose demonic persona makes the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster appear more like bank robbers by comparison. Fiennes, despite the warped face and absent nose, is entirely believable as the sworn enemy of Harry Potter and an adversary to all that is good in the Wizard World.<br /><br />However the crux of the tale (as with the rest of the series), surrounds the three young leads inside an incredible production. The first couple of installments were written more for a younger age group. Now the characters and their respective actors have grown in complexity and subtlety. They reside inside the skins of their characters in ways which make you believe they understand and appreciate them more. No longer the smart class show-off of younger years, Hermione has grown into a young woman beginning to appreciate more fully the powers she has been taught which can transform the world rather than simply being the most-liked by her teachers. Weasley has a better sense of himself and is now dating Hermione which would have been unthinkable in the first few Harry Potter stories. And Harry Potter is nearing the moment when he can face Lord Vortemort as a near-equal without cringing at the sound of the name.<br /><br />The plot of the present installment is the most complex and compelling yet. Voldemort has gained power over the Ministry of Magic who are running the wizard government akin to Nazism of the 1930's. Anyone with ""muggle"" (i.e. non-wizard) blood risks being expelled and/or subdued by high-ranking officials in kangaroo courts. They have even placed a roman-inspired relief in the wizard town square showing muggles being subdued by magic. Although the wizard ministry and government are run by mortal wizards, Lord Voldemort is pulling the puppet strings like a demonic equivalent of the Godfather. He is on the verge of gaining complete immortality through the Horcrux's, amulet artifacts which also have an interesting side-affect of making the wearer become more self-absorbed and selfish, not unlike the Ring of the ""Lord of the Rings"". Dumbledore had begun the mission of destroying the Horcrux's as a means of defeating Voldemort; the mission now is passed onto Harry Potter and his friends. Harry Potter along with allies escort him to a refuge but are immediately besieged by the soulless dementors. There must have been a traitor among them which tipped off Voldemort.<br /><br />The three young wizards then engage in a two-fold quest: to obtain and destroy the Horcrux's to stop Voldemort from permanently gaining immortality thereby becoming the absolute-ruler of the Wizard World for eternity. Think of Adolph Hitler wielding a wand. Unfortunately, the Horcrux's appear indestructible, and they must obtain an artifact willed to Potter from the late Dumbledore, a sword, Godric Gryffindor, which Hermione realizes may contain enough power to destroy the Horcrux. During their quest, they keep stumbling upon a strange triangular symbol, which even appears on one of the stones of a cemetery at Harry Potter's birthplace which is also his parents' deathplace.<br /><br />A brilliant and compelling film all the way around despite having been absent from Hogwarts, with absolutely phenomenal effects which neither impedes the story nor hinders the acting but enhances the Wizard World and the story contained within. The acting is some of the best I have seen for a fantasy film/story, it's only rival Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"". The best which can said of this film is that it never appears like the filmmakers were relying solely on the Harry Potter name for success. They have forged a brilliant film to climax the series, one of the best all-time in fantasy-filmmaking.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Unless you found one of these discussion forums, how would you know that a 2-disc set of Deathly Hallows, Part 1 was even available for sale? What if you don't have a Walmart store in your area? You can't readily get to any in our state by public transit.  Walmart's website sold out within days. No indication it will be re-stocked.<br /><br />This has harmed consumers. The 2 disc DVD set is now being offered for 400% of the $20 retail price. It was unfair and likely an illegal trade practice for WB to restrict sales of the 2-disc DVD set to Walmart. Harry Potter isn't just any other movie franchise; it is a market mover. The extra content on the Blu-ray discs could have easily been made available on the DVD player version. Was this a cynical ploy by Warner Bros. to push consumers to the more profitable Blu-Ray platform? It isn't a trivial switch. Besides buying a Blu-ray player, you also have to buy a digital TV, cables, and upgrades.<br /><br />The product description is confusing and mis-leading. Walmart posted the Combo description for the 2-disc set. No wonder so many people bought the Combo set only to find out afterwards that the extra content wasn't viewable on DVD players. Some retailers offered only the expensive Blu-ray Combo set, and not the DVD single.  That's not the way to treat customers.<br /><br />WB rushed these discs to market.

Fans already know what's going to happen and for those who don't I'm not going to spoil it except to state up front that the film doesn't have a conclusion but ends on a great cliff hanger.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good--the image is crisp and true to the theatrical presentation of the film. The look of the film is much more subdued with colors that are often muted to reflect the much more serious and dangerous elements of the story.<br /><br />The audio sounds terrific with a strong 5.1 lossless mix.<br /><br />The DVD that is included has a substandard transfer. I'm not sure what Warner has thinking here as many people will just be buying the DVD (perhaps they were thinking that most folks would be watching the show on their car DVD players to keep the kids occupied).<br /><br />Special features include a featurette on shooting the scene for the seven Harrys. We also get ""Maximum Movie Mode"" the interactive feature that acts as a commentary track taking you behind-the-scenes of the movie while you're watching it.<br /><br />We also get a promotional featurette on the creation and opening of the theme park in Florida. There are a number of deleted scenes which while they don't necessarily add to the film per se do give us some additional character moments. There's also a featurette on the cast playing golf (!)which seemed kind of stretching. There's also a featurette on the recording of the soundtrack.<br /><br />There isn't a disc with a digital copy for those who use such things--you have to download the digital copy of the film. Demerits to Warner for advertising it on the package which implies that there is a digital copy disc inside which is a bit misleading. This isn't the first itme Warner has done this with the digital downloads--they did this also for a season of ""Supernatural"".<br /><br />The film certainly deserves five stars--it's a terrific, entertaining and thrilling ride. The transfer for the Blu-ray is stellar and the extras including the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" are good if not as exceptional as I'd liked (I'm assuming they're saving material for one of those ""Ultimate"" boxed sets).<br /><br />For those that are interested Best Buy has an exclusive Blu-ray disc that includes two featurettes that take you behind-the-scenes including the scene set in Picadilly and the location shooting of the film. Some of the interviews are recycled from other material on the set but there's also footage that isn't included in any of the other featurettes.<br /><br />Over all this is a good set with the film being exceptional. Potter fans will enjoy this set.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943042,B004WMKSH2, A3N261O9CZ4MMH,4.0, Great movie....but....,"First of all, I loved the movie.  It's wonderfully told and imagined and a great build up for the final film. Definitely worth buying!<br /><br />I am,however, disappointed with the quality of the film transfer to DVD. It has possibly some of the most pixelated images I have ever seen in a DVD. This is especially evident when the scenes are dark, which is most of the movie.  I'm not sure why this is so bad on the DVD compared to other films of similar darkness and length....but I think they should have put more focus into clearing it up some.<br /><br />Otherwise, I love it....just wish it has the opening scene from part 2 as the bluray version does.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943043,B004WMKSH2, A3GRFF0YB9WW09,1.0, Horrible DVD Quality,"Many reviewers complain about the darkness of the picture quality which I soundly second.  However, this has been a problem with the last few Potter DVDs we have purchased, not to mention an increasing graininess of the overall picture quality, so I began to assume this was the look the director was going for.  So while it has been quite difficult to make out what is going on in some of the scenes, my primary complaint with this DVD has been that the fast action/fight scenes freeze and unfreeze throughout the action resulting in a very jerky effect.  The chase through the woods is not fun to watch given the way in which the scene was shot coupled with this freeze/unfreeze movement. When this occurred with a video rented from Netflicks, I thought we had a well used video.  Just bought our own copy from Best Buy yesterday and the problem seems even worse.  A number of reviewers point to WB making cheap film to dvd transfer in an effort to ""force"" consumers to switch to blu-ray technology.  Oddly enough this seems plausible and I plan on making a complaint to the FTC, not to mention probably not buying Deathly Hallows II.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943044,B004WMKSH2, A3OV8IFUUSKWSK,3.0, Harry Potter and the DARK Hollows,"Boy, I feel like I watched an entirely different movie based on all the positive feedback I've read.<br /><br />I really don't understand what has happened with the movie versions of the Potter series.  They have gotten progressively darker.  Literally.  The notice really began after the ""Goblet of Fire.""  They may as well have shot the movie in a cave for I felt like that is what I was watching.  I have read every book and anybody watching this movie who has not, would be totally lost.  Half the time I was trying to figure out exactly what was going on.<br /><br />All in all, a huge disappointment.  I keep buying the DVDs just so I have the entire series but this is one I doubt I would want to watch again.  Remember when Harry Potter was a ""kid's movie"" and was mystical and fun?  What happened?  I know they grew up and times became dark and troubled but I think it was taken a bit too far.  Perhaps Ron should have kept his Deluminator lit throughout the movie to ""shed some light"" on the action.<br /><br />Best movies of the bunch, in my opinion, are the first three.  ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", ""The Chamber of Secrets"" and ""The Prisoner of Azkaban.""<br /><br />After watching Part 1 of ""The Deathly Hallows"" I know what to expect in Part 2.  DARKNESS.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943045,B004WMKSH2, A2OU415LB9I5J6,3.0, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I,"In part seven of the Harry Potter series, we see great actors either returning to reprise their roles or showing up for the first time. Returning as a Ministry of Magic employee is former Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher and temporary Headmistress of Hogwarts Delores Umbridge, played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunten. Joining the cast for the first time is the amazing Bill Nighy (Still Crazy, Shaun of the Dead) playing the new Minister of Magic (unfortunately too short- lived a role), as well as the brilliant Rhys Ifans (Notting Hill, and the underrated Human Nature) as Luna Lovegood's father Xenophilius Lovegood. In the end what really makes this movie great is the characterization. This film would not work were it not for Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint doing their jobs properly. In Deathly Hallows, it's Rupert Grint who really delivers. Rupert has always been the comedic relief of the group, but here he provides the dramatic tension and performs beyond admirably.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is all about character development. Yates, who's now directed more Harry Potter films than any other director in the series, does a great job of creating a film that maintains tension both between its main characters and the ever-present forces of good and evil that dominate the wizarding world. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is not about action or plot development; it focuses its attention largely on the people involved in these extraordinary adventures. J.K. Rowling gave us all a gift by creating such memorable figures to populate her books, and the directors of the Harry Potter films develop these well-loved characters against a brilliantly realized backdrop.<br /><br />[Spoiler Alert: If you have not read the books or seen the movie I recommend that you not read past this point]<br /><br />That said, Deathly Hallows is not without its flaws.  The changes that were made to realize this story in cinematic form are rather problematic. There's no full explanation as to why Dobby is around, so had you not read the book his presence might have been confusing. Kreacher's actions are also a mystery, as the troublesome house elf acquiesces too soon and easily to Harry's request without further explanation. Were it not for plot holes of this nature, this film would be much better. As the series has progressed, it seems that the Harry Potter films have strayed further and further from the source material. I'm a big fan of Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince, both directed by Yates, but those movies left viewers ill prepared for this installment.<br /><br />The problem with converting this series into film form is the same as it is with any movie based on a book: the conflict that exists between the viewer's perception of the book and the director's. Most people would say that there has to be something wrong with either the viewer or the director when it comes to an adaptation of a novel, but in reality there's nothing wrong with either--they just sometimes differ. When it comes to Harry Potter, I'm a fan of both the books and the film adaptations, and one of the things that I like about the movies is the vision of the director. Yates has been brilliant at building these characters beyond what we've seen from them previously, and he continues to do just that in Deathly Hallows. There are things I would love to see in the movie adaptation, such as Kreacher's story of how he helped Regulus recover the locket, but would that detract from the story of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron? Most likely. That's why Yates is great. He knows where the real brilliance of the story lies, and that we can fill in the details by reading the books. He puts on film only what we need.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Yates is the fourth director involved in this series and the only one making these films with a knowledge of how Harry Potter's story ends. As a result, he's had to include things in this film that don't seem to make sense because of omissions made in earlier installments. Had Dobby been more involved in Goblet of Fire, his presence in this film would have seemed more logical and his death would have been more meaningful to the movie viewers who haven't read the books.<br /><br />[End of Spoilers]<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is a good movie, but not the best of the series. To a point it feels slightly episodic and ends quite abruptly. The acting is amazing, and the visuals are brilliant. One can't help but get the feeling that this is leading to something bigger.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943058,B004WMKSH2, A3GHBLTVJLRPAH,3.0, Least favorite of the series,"I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter films and my liking of them has increased with each new film that is released. And before I go any further, I should note that I did not read any of the books (except for the first one) before seeing the films. I am much more of a movie fan (obviously) and my philosophy is that if you want to be able to enjoy both the movies and the books, see the movie first.<br />Now, back to Harry Potter. This film marks the beginning of the end as Harry, Hermione and Ron travel the world looking for horcruxes (evil artifacts containing pieces of Voldemort's soul) and the means to destroy them.<br />This is my least favorite film in the franchise. It was dark, it was depressing, and it raised more questions than answers. Now, I know that this is supposed to be a two-parter and since the story is only half finished, there will always be lots of questions. But overall, there was very little here to enjoy. Every movie usually has a stunning climax and some really cool magical moments in the film, and this one lacked both. The climax was weak and there wasn't really anything new to see in this film. Nothing that we haven't really seen before. And if we've seen it all before...<br />I'm sure most of my opinions will change (hopefully) with the viewing of the second part, but until then, I'm not a big fan of this film. Aside from that, the special effects were impressive, the acting was well played, and the story moved smoothly.<br /><br />As far as questionable content:<br />The film is dark and there are some scary and violent moments throughout. This is not recommended for younger children.<br />*Spoiler Alert*<br />According to the book, In the moment where Ron faces off against the demon within the horcrux, he is given a vision of Harry and Hermione in love and there is a moment where they kiss. In the film, the ""kiss"" became more of a sex scene with Harry and Hermione making out while completely nude. You never see any private parts, but it is a very risky scene. I hated this moment of the film. The naked make-out session was inappropriate, random, and just plain weird. So, just a heads up.<br />*End Spoiler Alert*<br />[...]",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943059,B004WMKSH2, A1SC682D5FO0KC,3.0, Harry Potter and the Emo Camping Trip,"I've seen all the Potter films, and really like the early ones.  Much of what I like about them is the ""magic"" - colorful costumes, magical creatures, Hogwarts (both the setting and the school atmosphere), and John Williams fantastic musical score.  Unfortunately, most of that is missing here.  The kids are on the run, so the whole Hogwarts school setting is absent from this film, and instead they spend most of their time in a drab tent, camping in the drab wilderness, dressed in really drab muggle clothes, in drab lighting (the whole movie seems to take place on an overcast day - don't try watching this when the sun is coming through your windows, or you won't be able to see much of the film!).  Sadly, they don't have John Williams doing the music for this one, and the composer chooses not to utilize Williams's iconic themes from the previous movies, leaving an important connection to the feel of the series out, and the music doesn't do anything to create a magical Harry Potter atmosphere.  Another major part of my enjoyment of the early films was the friendship between the 3 main characters (although there were tensions at times).  In this film, the characters are pretty much uptight the whole film, and their relationships are strained.  Although I understand the significance to the plot, this makes watching the movie more tense than relaxing for me. Also, an important part of the film is to show the frustration and lack of progress of the book - the film succeeds in this enough, but, like my previous criticism, I don't find feeling frustrated and like nothings getting anywhere to be my idea of ""good entertainment""!<br />  This is not to say this movie is terrible - just that I find it the least enjoyable of the series - it moves the plot along, and I'd certainly recommend it for someone working the way through the whole series, but I wouldn't recommend it as a stand-alone viewing experience.  On the bright side, there are plenty of good parts:  the initial scene where Harry leaves the Dursley house, the scene where they sneak into the Ministry of Magic, where they visit the Lovegoods house, etc.  I guess, wherever they make it look like a magical world I enjoy it - I go to Harry Potter to see something different and magical, not to see the drabbest side of the everyday modern world; I can see that for free!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The pacing is leisurely, sometimes TOO leisurely, but the emotion is intense and there's a real sense of danger and crisis. The action sequences are explosive and scary, and some of the ""on the road"" scenes are breathlessly beautiful. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson all push their acting envelopes. Best moments: a heartbreaking dance between Harry and Hermione, the Godric's Hollow sequence, and the pursuit by the Snatchers. I wish director Yates had varied the blue-gray palette, but if you bring patience to the viewing, you'll have a rich experience.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer looks good, and I was relieved to invoke English subtitles so I could comprehend what the characters were saying. Over the past decade, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson have gone from speaking in crystalline British syllables to mumbling unintelligibly.<br /><br />The extras follow the tradition of all the Potter DVDs--they're crap. Well, except for the Maximum Movie Mode version of the film, with many pop-ups and mini-documentaries. That's interesting. ""The Seven Harrys,"" showing how this special effect was accomplished, COULD have been informative but it's so quick and raggedly cut that it's of no help. ""On the green with Rupert, Tom, Oliver, and James"" features a quartet of Potter actors playing a round of golf and reminiscing about the series. Not enlightening (and you REALLY need the subtitles for this!). ""Dan, Rupert, and Emma's running competition"" is a one or two minute featurette about Dan, Rupert and Emma trying to outrun each other during the Snatchers scene. Useless.

4943085,B004WMKSH2, A1T35JQOJIPXRL,2.0, Great movie - terrible transfer.,"I purchased this movie after seeing it in theatres and it is clearly a masterpiece of film making<br /><br />However, in the Blu-Ray transfer there's an abboration in the anamorphic lens used to make the transfer that causes the image to be non-square and a light bar to appear running down the left side of the image, approximately 20% of the way into the image, that appears and disappears approximately every fifteen minutes.  On any sort of good viewing equipment this is noticable and highly distracting.<br /><br />The audio, on the other hand, is a superb mix, possibly one of the best I've ever heard, with more detail than was available in the theatrical release thanks to the additional bandwidth available on a Blu-Ray disc compared to the DD/DTS/SDDS tracks on the film print.<br /><br />Overall, although this is a great film, this review only receives two stars because for such a major release Warner Brothers should have double checked the digital transfer from film, and it's clear that they didn't.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943086,B004WMKSH2, A2EPKLZETLIO8H,4.0, Better than Number 6,"I liked this film.  I disagree with just about all of the criticisms I've read.  It is NOT too slow.  It is NOT too depressing.  It is NOT boring.  What it is, is a reasonably faithful translation to screen of what Ms. Rowling wrote (unlike with the case of The Half-Blood Prince).  And what she wrote was a grimly realistic depiction of a harrowing journey to the ""dark side"" of a Nazi-like fascist nightmare society and what it would it be like to be outlaws on the run from such a state.  I was deeply moved when I read the book of just how isolating and demoralizing being in such a situation can be, and on top of that, we have Harry's descent into doubt and self-recriminations, especially focusing on his relationship with Dumbledore, which he gradually realizes is not what he thought it was, as he comes to see that Dumbledore himself wasn't who he thought he was.<br /><br />The testing of the bonds of friendship is a very important part of this story and I thought the film did a very good job of exploring that theme.<br /><br />So why only 4 stars?  Because once again, as with the Half-Blood Prince, the DVD I bought is way too dark.  This simply cannot be intentional. There are times when I can't see anything at all happening on the screen.  After making all allowances for the fact that much of the story does take place at nighttime, in the dark, you still want to have the screen lit well enough so that a viewer can see what's going on.  The artistry is wasted if it can't be seen.  This impacted my enjoyment of the DVD.  Therefore, only 4 stars.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

There were a number of scenes I would have liked to see from the book which would have helped move the story along just as well as<br />leaving them out. The film did not look as dark as some other reviewers have claimed. I watched it on a regular television with a standard DVD-VHS player. If you have not read the book you may find the film more than a little confusing, many<br />changes were made in the screenplay that were not needed to put the story across; the special effects are as good as ever and the soundtrack is just as good as all the others in the series. Will probably get a copy of the DVD to add to my Potter DVD collection to have the full set, but do not feel that this is the best of the<br />series of films. Cannot wait to see the eighth and last film. Though I suspect it will have many changes from the book too. One last comment I feel that the Dursleys and the actors that portray them got the short end of the stick in this film.

There was a certain amount of fun to knowing what was going on because I read the books at least a dozen times while those around me hadn't a clue.<br /><br />Still, I wonder if the director figured there was no need for much clarification because most of us would've gotten the points of the movie through friends, or because they were betting many of us have read these books.<br /><br />Either way, the omission of details to be explained made this movie better than some of the last HP movies. Somehow, in their omissions, they kept the movie simple and more sensible, and made this a much better film than the others.

4943127,B004WMKSH2, A3I0I917VF3LKG,5.0, Simply Put - Incredible Film!,"Harry Potter has always been one of my favorite books series. It is, by no means, a ""children's"" story but one of the most wonderful literary works ever written, with some of the best character development, moral lessons and meaningful themes found in fiction. For this reason, Harry Potter has attracted and continues to attract millions of fans of all ages, genders and nationalities. Deathly Hallows is no exception; it has always been my favorite book in the HP series and is now one of my favorite movies. Period.<br /><br />Unlike the previous film installments in the series, Deathly Hallows-Part 1 provides an exploration of characters, as well as an emotional build-up to the conclusion; it stands in a league of its own. Everything from the cinematography to the soundtrack is well done and quite true to the book. For me, it's a complete transformation--one that makes me feel like I'm watching a movie that's part of a different series altogether.<br /><br />I have read several reviews of Deathly Hallows here and on other sites. Though most are quite favorable, there are a few that criticize different aspects of the movie. Though I can understand certain people disliking the plot or pacing, I completely disagree about the criticisms about the performances.  In my opinion, the trio's acting, particularly that of Rupert Grint, was excellent.  There are specific scenes such as the fight in the tent, the destruction of the Horcrux, Ron's return speech and Malfoy Manor that are spot-on. The performances in the past HP films might be considered mediocre by some, and that's fine; however, this should not be the case with Deathly Hallows.<br /><br />When this movie came out, I was a bit nervous as to how it would turn out. Needless to say, I was so pleasantly surprised that I ended up coming back to see it several times while it was playing in theaters.

The film was great other than that. I thought that it would've been better if Hagrid would've gave Harry the pouch that comes out in the book, I loved the movie and i can't wait for Part II.

4943133,B004WMKSH2, A2FVW24CH83R2P,5.0, Well done film adaptation of a great Harry Potter book,"The Harry Potter series of books are the best I have ever read.  At times I am disappointed when some of the film adaptations delete sections, compress, or alter the books; although most are good movies in their own right.  Deathly Hallows part I does a good job translating the first 2/3 of the book and I would say the movie is about 75% accurate and captures the essence of the book.  There are parts that are very well brought to life, particularly the part where Harry sees the Patronus that leads him to the sword of Gryffindor, the return of Ron, and the destruction of the locket Horcrux.  Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rubert Grint, and Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) have really grown into their roles - when I see them, I see their book counterparts.  The movies do tend to downplay Harry's temper and diminish his frequent use of the invisibility cloak in the books (one of the Deathly Hallows), but it has been fun watching the actors grow up and the filmmaking team as a whole has made a very deliberate effort to stay true to J.K. Rowling's vision.  Deathly Hallows part I has really nice cinematography and sets the stage well for the finale.  Highly recommended - but always read the book first to get the full story, and enjoy the movie to see most things come to life.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

It's even better since it comes from a true masterpiece by JK Rowling and the fact that the director and producers stayed so true to the books originality made me sing with joy.

School is out for Harry, Ron and Hermione  and things are very dark in the wizarding and the muggle world as Voldemort and the Death Eaters take over.  There is a horrible sense of foreboding and despair in this film and the tension is not so much in the action, as in the minds of our three heroes.  The actors did an excellent job of portraying three children who suddenly had to not only grow up, but also fight an evil that adults were failing to contain.<br /><br />I badly wanted the movie to keep going through to the end of the story.  My hope is that when part II comes out, the theaters run part one and two together (with an Intermission...remember those?)<br /><br />See Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in the theater, then get the DVD ... you'll appreciate a lot of the nuances that went by quickly on the big screen.

No big deal, I figured I'd just cancel the order and buy the movie somewhere else.  However, when I go to my Amazon account I can't cancel the order because it is being prepared for shipping.

4943138,B004WMKSH2, A5QWQFSEP7FP5,2.0, So Disappointing,"Since there is so many great reviews already written, I will just give a brief suggestion.  I've read all the books at least three times each and never get bored and actually have discovered a new detail I missed before.  It's like a treasure.  I think why this movie, as well as the Half Blood Prince fail us is because the lack of important dialogue!  Seriously the beauty of the Harry Potter series is all the discussion between the characters that draw us in and make us a part of the story.<br /><br />A small example in this movie of lost valueable script: In the book, when Harry is digging the grave for Doby, he is making the most important decision between Horcux or Hallows(hense the tittle of the book!)but in the movie there was no reference to it.  I saw the movie with my family, that have not read the book but are fans of the stories and movies, were absolutely lost when the movie shows Harry digging the grave and ""He who must not be named"" taking the wand from Dumbledore.  Couldn't the movie producers added a short conversation among Harry, Ron and Hermanie explaining that?  Really they added a bunch of other parts that are absolutely meaningless, like the dance scene.  Through the whole movie I had to constantly explained what was going on so the movie would make sense to everyone else.  It was so disappointing, and they too lost interest in watching the movie.<br /><br />It's so simple.  All the last two movies really needed to make them as great as the first three was more dialogue!  I'm not even sure we're going to bother to go to the theatre for the final film.  We'll just wait for in it to go on DVD.  I'm tired of the emptiness in the films when the books give so much more.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

This is the penultimate completion of that slide, with enough of the good stuff stripped out of the novel so as to render it almost faceless and meaningless. One of the themes of the last novel is that Harry has been ultimately betrayed and abandoned by all of the adults in his life - including Dumbledore, who was so busy acting so mysterious and wizardly that he did not tell Harry what he needed to know in order to survive. There is no trace of Harry Potter's inner conflict in this movie. All that leaves you with is a bunch of guys throwing power bolts out of magic wands.

I felt it was written more for people who had read the book, that a lot was left unexplained.  I watched it intently, but was often left feeling a little confused.

4943150,B004WMKSH2, A8G9GETA2OLMZ,2.0, I Like the Previous Ones Better,"For me, this was an odd movie.<br /><br />First, it was dark.  Almost every scene was either dark blue or dark brown, with only glimpses of sun.<br /><br />I realize this is thematic, and symbolizes the dark, almost impossible predicament, the three principals (Harry, Hermione, Ron) are in.<br /><br />Second, it almost entirely lacked the interesting subordinate characters that made the previous Harry Potters so lively: Snape, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Luna, the Malfoys, the rest of the Weasleys, etc., etc. do appear, but briefly--then they are gone.<br /><br />Also thematic, I realize: the isolation and loneliness are deliberately claustrophobic, and intensify the fears and hopelessness of the Big 3.<br /><br />Still, these give the film a closed-in, deprived feel, that, however thematic, make it seem thin and strained.<br /><br />Third, the wedding is given short shrift, while the jealousy-theme goes on interminably.<br /><br />Also thematic, I know: this is the story of growing up, and all the melodrama and angst of being a teenager.<br /><br />Still, all this indicates that the Epic Good-vs.-Evil conflict has taken over the movie, at the expense of everything else.<br /><br />The whimsy, the craziness, the unexpected twists, the fun settings (like Hogwarts and even Harry's horrible foster-family),and the humor are all gone.<br /><br />I suppose this was all deliberate, but it makes for grim watching.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943152,B004WMKSH2, A30UWBHC4QL4JT,5.0, Finally! A Fitting Adaptation,"I have always enjoyed the Harry Potter film adaptations. That being said, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I, takes the cake in all respects as compared to previous Potter movies. As you may be aware, this is split after Malfoy Manor, therefore, you will not get a resolution with this film. However, the movie does end at a fitting point, setting a clear stage for the culmination in the next film, to be released in July 2011. What sets this film apart, however, is that it completes the transformation begun in the film adaptation of the Half-Blood Prince. This film is very DARK and emotional. This was the intention, as the Harry Potter sequel matured along with its originally intended audience. I would recommend this film for all ages, as there are no particularly troublesome scenes, yet, on the whole, this is an adult film, filled with angst, struggle, and believable character interaction. Acting has consistently improved over the course of the films: this is no exception. Definitely recommended, and you will not be able to refrain from watching this movie over and over if you are a Harry Potter fan. Also, this is consistent with the books: with minimal add-ons occurring only to improve the overall quality of the film. The highlight, for me, however, was the segment portraying the ""Tale of the Three Brothers,"" done in an animated storybook style. Yes, these films have developed into successful accompaniments to the books.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943157,B004WMKSH2, A2IK1PNN2N80AH,2.0, WB robs JK Rowling and Fans,"I have the HP series in books (preferred) and in dvds. I loved this movie in the theater and saw it a couple of times (having learned to not compare the movies to the depth of the books). It was probably my favorite to date if I thought of ranking the movies. The dvd is a disgrace as WB seems to have eliminated scenes and definitely transfered data so poorly that the viewing is riddled with visual pauses, jumps and distortions. All prior dvds had two discs with nice extras. The prior dvd versions were true to the theater versions and were decent quality for viewing. WB execs who authorized putting out a shortened, cheaply and badly transferred video single disc dvd should be shamed and reprimanded/fired. This reflects poorly on WB's greed overcoming their pride in quality and it is insulting to JKRowling who entrusted her series to them.<br /><br />Do they expect all of the HP fans, who've already spent good money on the entire collection of HP dvds to date to now, at the final year's movies, run out and buy a Blue-Ray player and re-buy the prior years in Blue-Ray version??? Of course, I'm reading reviews that, while the blue-ray version does include more of the theater movie without glitchy distortions, they also received no new extras.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, WB is obviously saving up extras now to get us to buy the ultimate editions. I recommend most everything that is authorized HP, but feel WB owes JKR and the fans an apology...and a replacement dvd worth the price. I find myself wondering if the ultimate edition dvd's will also be short-changed?? I'll wait for reviews before considering buying.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

This seems to go to a rather dark place which unto itself can make for great drama but I prefer to see the characters rise above the challenges. Wonderful acting, beautiful scenery (if mostly stark) but our intrepid heroes appear less and less intrepid - perhaps the point of their dire circumstances and maybe more realistic but not more preferable personally. A two part final episode might be a throw back to the cliff-hangers of earlier cinema but it doesn't seem to have the same sense of holding-one's-breath tension. The good guys are quite beaten down, the bad guy has all the advantage and you don't get the feeling the heroes are even ready to step up and face him. Obviously this is all personal preference, I like the little guys to at least keep getting their shots in and to be able to see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel (even if it turns out to be a train rushing at them).

That should make for a really grand finish to the series. Part 1 is a generally exciting film that holds one's attention very well. Although the section where the three are on the run may seem to slow down the pace, the movie tracks the book pretty well and these scenes provide an opportunity to reveal the emotions with which each of them must deal.<br /><br />I've noticed some negative comments on sound and picture and have just replayed the opening part with the sole intention of evaluating the sound and picture; the results are conclusive, they are both outstanding. The surround speakers are given a terrific workout and the subwoofer is nicely exercised as well. I would give both sound and picture top marks for excellence. The picture is crisp and clear and never too dark so as to mask the action.<br /><br />I would agree that if one had not read the book it could be more difficult to follow the story's turns and twists. If one has not read the book this would be a great time to do just that. I believe it was better to divide the book into two parts so the story could be more systematically covered. I hope the release of the Blu-ray 3D version will not be delayed too long after the movie is released in theaters.<br /><br />In summary, this is an outstanding movie version of the first part of the book and provides a solid platform for the completion of the story.

You gotta be original somehow.<br /><br />What's up with all the icky green?  In this movie, nice happy blues, reds, oranges and yellows are not allowed.  Everything must be black, white, brown, gray, or this pale, slightly blue green that's just all over the place.  Check out the cover of the box: those are the only colors you'll see in this movie.  The only exception is in this scene involving the snake Nagini, which was very jarring.  Color palettes do not exist in real life.<br /><br />The movie does seem too long while watching it at home.  In the theater, it didn't seem to drag so much.  Normally, the second time watching a movie seems to go quicker.  This felt longer.  I'll probably have to fast forward the camping sequence next time I watch it.<br /><br />It's a little sloppy since there are a few things which are left unexplained, for instance the broken piece of glass which seems to be showing (spoiler deleted) in it.  I guess if I had the books memorized, I'd know what was going on there.  Maybe they'll explain it in part II, but I don't have my hopes up.<br /><br />Okay, those are my main nit-picks.  It's PG-13, with a not-exactly-kinda-sorta nude scene, so it's not for little kids.<br /><br />My single disc DVD has ONLY the 5 following deleted scenes:<br /><br />- The Dursley House: Harry and Aunt Petunia As They Leave House<br />- The Dursley House: Harry and Dudley Shake Hands<br />- Ministry of Magic Lifts: Harry Tells Arthur He's Being Tracked<br />- Tent: Trio Discusses Destroying The Locket<br />- Montage: Ron and Hermione Skimming Stones<br /><br />[Edit: These descriptions are copied from a previous review, which seemed to indicate that the single disc DVD had MORE deleted scenes than the 5 I list above.  Am I mistaken?  Are there more hidden as Easter Eggs somewhere?  I'm trying to give you accurate information here, help me out.]<br /><br />And personally I'm glad these weren't in the theatrical version, as they would have slowed the movie down even further, and the Dudley handshake scene doesn't fit the emotional tone they're setting up.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943169,B004WMKSH2, AN9J46667D80O,4.0, Tromping on hallowed ground,"So here we are at last. Part one of the last film of one of the best series of movies in a very long time. The Harry Potter series, books and movies both, have been generally very good, very well-received and very profitable.<br /><br />Part one of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is very good. In many ways its better than the first half of the book it's based on. It tells the tale... well, you all know what it's about. Harry and friends go hunting down the various parts of Voldemort's soul in order to destroy him. They do this with the support and hindrance of roughly half of the Royal Shakespearean Company.<br /><br />The movie suffers from one of the same problems that the book suffers from, and that's what I describe as ""Harry Potter and the Endless Camping Trip"". There are many, many scenes with the kids out camping and trying to decide what to do next. They angst, they are argue, the waffle and debate. This does not make for the most compelling reading nor the most compelling watching. Frankly the camping scenes could've been trimmed down considerably and we wouldn't have lost much.<br /><br />Aside from that, everything about the movie superb, and I'm very happy Warner Bros chose not to release it in 3-D. There's just no need for it. The movie looks fine without it, and hopefully they will abandon plans to release part two in that format.<br /><br />Whomever it was that cast Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (who looks better and better with each film), Emma Watson and all the other primaries should probably receive a special Oscar for their efforts. They managed to cast the perfect actors for this series, and thanks to that and a great respect for the material we've been treated to a series of films where even the weakest is still pretty damn good. There's not many other film franchises one can say that about.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943171,B004WMKSH2, AQZH7YTWQPOBE,5.0, This ain't Hogwarts anymore,"I will say this - the Harry Potter series is getting darker and better as it progresses. I like David Yates' innovative camera angles and pacing - they really do set the mood for the film and make it quite chilling. The animated sequence illustrating the Death Hallows was beautiful. The campsite locations were all exotic and evoked the landscapes of the Lord of the Rings. I was actually surprised that we don't see Hogwarts at all (except for a brief cameo).<br /><br />Unfortunately, there were a few bad influences from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P5HRMI"">Twilight</a>, particularly a vision of Harry and Hermione making out. These were usually minimal, but still stuck out like a sore thumb. Also, if you haven't read the books, some scenes will seem pointless or extraneous.<br /><br />Probably the best part about this movie was the ending and how it sets up for the grand finale. I won't spoil the ending, but I think Yates chose a perfect spot to split the final book in half.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943172,B004WMKSH2, A23CGJKX5BQ46B,2.0, Good thing I read the book first!,"I am totally amazed that anyone would give this movie 5 stars. I did not see the movie in the theater, rather I waited for the DVD so I could watch it closer to the release of part 2.  If a person watched it without reading the book, they'd have no idea what half the plotlines were about.  The whole ""searching for the wand Voldy flashbacks"", and the addition of more than one wand maker, was very confusing for the members of my family who hadn't read the books but had seen all the previous movies. Personally this movie needed either more dialog or a narrator IMO. It was ok, but I prefer the earlier movies when more of the book was included. To me, the later books (5,6,7) aren't really ""movie material"" without a narrator.  Look at LOR, they did a great job on those movies by having a narrator introduce the complicated plot lines at the beginning, so a viewer had a guide as they watched (and a clue). For readers of the books, this movie was OK. For people who just wanted to continue the series on screen and haven't read the books, not so good.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943173,B004WMKSH2, A27P0MW8TE1JQP,5.0, It's Magic! They finally got it right!,"The beginning of the End: The first installment of the last HP novel is here... Easily the BEST of the film series adaptations. There was so much plot damage control to be done due to the copious story cuts on the previous films that it seemed impossible to make Deathly Hallows true to the text. But thanks to stretching this one to a 5 hour project and some character stacking rivaling a Dagwood sandwich, HP Vii part one, is a promising start.<br /><br />The cavalcade of cameos may make your head spin, but it serves to make Harry's story more whole and his quest to find and destroy Voldemort's splintered soul richer for it. Appearances i feared we would never have, like older Weasley brother Bill just in time for his wedding, and complete with werewolf scars. Another, belated introduction, new minster of magic Rufus Serimgeour, played Brilliantly by Bill Nighy (what a Doctor [Who] he would have made!) but oh so briefly, if only he had been in Order of the Phoenix. Also perfectly cast and missing from wayback, oily sneak thief Mundungus. The. Jar-Jar Binks of the wizarding world Dobby briefly returns. As does wandmaker Ollivander and goblin Griphook return. Dobby's appearance is much better than his first, although much impact is lost due to his absence from HP 4-6. But, as if to make up for this one of my favorite Dobby lines cut from Chamber of Secrets is sort of included in Hallows, ""Dobby never meant to kill, maim, ...but never kill.""<br /><br />Let's not forget our title character and his faithful sidekicks, Watson, Grint and Radcliffe each really comes into there own as actors here as Hermionie, Ron & Harry. Especially Grint's superbly-done jealous Horcrux-weary Ron. The rest of the wizard staples are there, if very briefly, A  few stolen moments w/ Ginny, a brief hint at (hopefully) heroic things to come from less homely Neville Longbottom.  The Muggle staples: the Dursleys, are on screen so briefly the point of the appearance is lost, really there isn't the closure of the text or the film series there at all.<br /><br />The effects as always are great, no glaring problems like, the centaurs & trolls of Sorcerer's Stone. The Opening chase from Privot Dr. is proof that the visuals are solid enough as are subtler moments like the raising of the Wedding tents. The music by Alexandre Desplat(composed Benjamin Button and Fantastic Mr. Fox) is pretty good but, sadly not any real substitute for Mr. John Williams.<br /><br />One nice touch to watch for is the retelling of the tale of the Deathly Hallows at Luna Lovegood's home accompanied by shadowpuppets via CGI, lovely and dynamic.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, plenty of interesting location work, perhaps the only disappointing aspect, other than the fact that we must wait for the big finish in July, is the lack of Hogwarts in the story... But, in my opinion, this only serves to strengthen the feeling of vulnerability and hopelessness of the state of things... Readers know this potential disappointment however will be rectified in part 2.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943179,B004WMKSH2, AGS6L2HIGVZZJ,5.0, A (very) detailed review,"I have previously been relatively unsatisfied with some of the movies due to a combination of poor script adaptation, suffering CG sequences or lack of acting prowess from a number of principal actors.  ""Deathly Hallows, Part 1"", however, is one of the only Harry Potter movies I walked away from without feeling it was incomplete in the way I felt about some of the other films. I was actually very satisfied with the end result, even with the changes it had, and felt strongly enough about it to see it again another 4 times.  There are obvious limitations when bringing a book to life on the big screen like budget problems and time constraints, actor availability, finding suitable and affordable filming locations and hiring a CGI company with the chops to get the job done.  I thought this movie addressed the shortcomings in prior films because most of what I saw I thought was done exceedingly well, both on the part of the crew and the actors.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Nearly everything in this movie conveyed a sense of impending doom and haunting depression, even the rusted and dilapidated WB logo at the start of the film.  That sense of malcontent and sadness has been a big source of criticism from some, mostly those who have not read the book and don't understand that the feeling of hopelessness is canon in a majority of the plot.  That said, I found it to be appropriate, even if a little exhausting at some parts such as the times where we see Harry and Hermione slowly gathering their things, without speaking to each other, getting ready to change locations, just to set up again without speaking.  This movie is about a war and, although it's primarily viewed on the periphery, war is never happy.  Relationships are severely tested and splintered in this installment, but such is the life of someone who has been tasked with a near-impossible job, with limited knowledge of how to handle and complete the task, with the added burden of having few allies to turn to, no family and no contact with friends, all while being hunted by a racist, fascist government.  It's not exactly a walk in the park for Harry, so to those who are criticizing the gloominess of the movie, try to keep that perspective in mind.  The book conveys those feelings of overwhelming depression well and I think the movie does as well as it can, without the help of the creative exposition that is the luxury of the written word.<br /><br />I thought the crew did an excellent job setting the tone of scenes with lighting and camera angles and finding gorgeous filming locations that took my breath away.  They were far more beautiful, unique and - more poignantly - much lonelier than I pictured in my head when I read the book; that to me was one of the things that contributed heavily to the sadness the heroes felt.  This was also one of the few things that I thought the movie did better than book.  And I don't say that lightly or very often.<br /><br />The relationships between the characters are so very strained the whole novel; I felt this was handled well in the movie, though I confess it was something I was very worried about going in.  Prior to this movie, there haven't been many opportunities for our heroes to express and sustain emotions as powerful and deep as the emotions they experience in this novel, and I while I've enjoyed the previous movies, I've always felt the actor's abilities (especially those of our 3 heroes) left something to be desired and I wasn't sure they could hack the more intense emotional scenes.  I was relieved to find that they did very well in many of the major scenes, such as the big fight that sends Ron packing.  I was so happy with the way this scene went, nearly word for word faithful to the book and acted wonderfully by Grint and Radcliffe.  Another favorite was the scene when was Ron is Splinched coming out of the Ministry.  I about cried the first time simply because of Watson's feeling during that ordeal, it was very impressive.  Also, her performance in the scene at Malfoy Manor was incredibly unnerving.  That scene was difficult to watch and had a few people around me covering their eyes.<br /><br />Harry's birthday was cut out entirely, which I'm reasonably fine with; there was nothing hugely important in that chapter that couldn't have been put where it ended up and I felt that was an acceptable re-write.  In fact, I quite enjoyed seeing sneaky big brother George (complete with a toothbrush stuck tactlessly in his wound) coming in to embarrass Ginny And Harry.  I felt that scene was one of the most awkward of the film, mostly because I find the ""chemistry"" between Radcliffe and Wright to be pathetically strained, put-on and creepy to watch.  Oliver Phelps (George) saved that scene.<br /><br />I also appreciated that when everyone regroups at the Burrow after the ""Seven Harrys"" scene, they gave Mr. Weasley's lines in the book (or the equivalent of his lines) to Fred instead.  I felt that was a nice touch, and even as I was reading Deathly Hallows the first time through, the whole time I thought it would have been more touching and appropriate to give Fred more of an interaction with his twin than he had in the book.  It was so moving that even the audience seemed to breathe the same sigh of relief that Fred did.  That's tough to manage in a film so major kudos to the sorely underused and underappreciated Phelps brothers.  I had high standards for the portrayal of Fred and George from the beginning due to the fact that they easily number among my favorite characters of the whole series, and I'm very pleased that James and Oliver deliver so well every time we see them.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />The only scene that was cut that I truly actually missed, was the scene when Kreacher tells the trio the heartbreaking truth about Sirius's brother Regulus; a truth that not even Sirius or the rest of his family knew.  Although it probably would have taken up a full 5 minutes in the film - a hugely long time for a theatrical scene - in order to convey the message accurately and do the story justice, I still missed it since it was inspiring to learn about Regulus' bravery and sacrifice.  That scene also marked the beginning to Kreacher's newfound loyalty to Harry, which comes into play later on.  I hope we'll see at least some mention of in Part 2, even though the fact that the basis for it was cut from Part 1 may make the connection in Part 2 seem a little random so those who haven't read the books.<br /><br />Another thing I didn't like, but don't blame ""Part 1"" for, is the immense amount of damage control it had to do after the shoddy, rushed offering that was ""Half-Blood Prince"".  It seemed like all the loose ends that were introduced in HBP and were important to the overall story but we cut out of HBP were all stuffed into the ""Seven Harrys"" sequence.  It was like as each character comes into the room, they have to stop and explain themselves to Harry (or rather, the viewing audience) since Yates failed to include those many major points in HBP.  It's too bad the ""Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" has to take the heat for that shortcoming.<br /><br />My one major criticism would be the soundtrack.  With the exception of the song ""Obliviate"" at the beginning, I found the music to be unremarkable and that it added next to nothing to the movie.  As a former music student and performer for many years, I tend to listen very hard for a movie's soundtrack (harder than many of my friends and family members do) and look for a good connection between the movie and music, since music has the power to convey so much that actors or good lighting simply can't.  I just didn't find that in Part 1.  A good score can be easily used to express a message or feeling in a scene, but I can't remember a point in the movie when I felt moved by anything on the soundtrack.  I wish they'd stuck with John Williams or another proven veteran, rather than change things up, though I understand scheduling conflicts probably came into play.  The dreariest, saddest music can also easily be the most beautiful and stirring, but this soundtrack really disappointed me.  Had the movie not been so good as to prevent me from really caring about how bland the music was, I might have rated it lower.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />As for the criticisms I've been seeing from others, one of the most common ones is that it's ""only half a movie"".  In order to preserve the integrity of the conclusion to the biggest selling book series of all time, it was split into two parts to allow for more time to address as much of the canon story as possible without rushing or cutting out too much detail that's so critical to the plot.  Some also complained it dragged.  This isn't a fair criticism for the movie since the camping scenes dominate the novel too, so to those who don't like it, take it up with Rowling, because the movie sticks to her book very well.  Actually, there's more camping in the book than there is in the movie, if I remember correctly.  Still, I didn't mind the camping scenes, since it illustrated the fact that Harry and Hermione (and Ron) really struggled with their goal while also having to be on the run for a majority of the story.<br /><br />Another popular critical judgment is the debated reason for the split in the first place.  Was Part 1 merely a ""lead-in"" to Part 2?  Just a ""filler"" or ""built-up tease"", as I've seen some critics and fans write?  To each his/her own, I suppose.  My opinion on it is no, it's not filler, and certainly not a way to squeeze more money out of the franchise, as a popular and shrewd argument that's been getting repeated quite a bit says.  However, if it were true, and money were the only driving force here - which I don't agree that it is - then please keep in mind that WB, whose purpose it is as a business is to bring in as much profit as possible, then really, what's the complaint here?  A corporation in a capitalistic society trying to cash in on something people like?  Perfectly understandable.<br /><br />But like I said above, I do not agree that the choice to split it was based on money-grubbing.  That decision was about maintaining the integrity of the story and I think a lot of people who've read the book can agree that this would have been a total let-down had the powers-that-be allowed all of Deathly Hallows to be stuffed into a single movie.  It's easy for those who are unfamiliar with the books to criticize that decision now simply because they don't know what's all to come from this point on, while the readers know that there's still A LOT of story in ""Deathly Hallows"" left to cover.  I'll be very interested to see if that attitude changes after Part 2 is released.  When they see just how much story is crammed into the final installment (certainly in the book and hopefully in the movie, assuming it does a good job of staying true), I think many of them will be forced to rethink that original opinion.  I think the 2-part split was for the best.<br /><br />Overall, I was impressed and very satisfied with how Part 1 was translated on-screen.  I, like many others, are stoked for Part 2 and can't wait to see how the movie brings to life the conclusion of the best-selling book series of all time.  I'm just annoyed there's an 8-month wait between Part 1 and 2.  Is it July 15th yet?!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943180,B004WMKSH2, A28RPKXOVO41AW,4.0," pretty good, but too long","*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Book 7 was not my favorite book, mostly because I feel like Rowling just killed people off for the sake of killing them off, and she really should have let SOME of my favorite characters live through it.<br /><br />That being said, part one was pretty true to the book (as others have stated), so most of my complaints about it are the same ones I had about the book (too slow, Ron being whiny, too many pointless deaths, etc).  I really did not enjoy the dance scene between Harry and Hermione.  I felt uncomfortably like a peeping tom while watching it (I don't go to movies to feel uncomfortable), and I don't like that they tried to create ""tension"" between Harry and Hermione.  They are just friends, and I don't know why they decided to spend 30 seconds flirting with the idea of 'more'.<br /><br />I really did not think that they gave Hedwig's death enough time or showed very well how upsetting it was to Harry.  When Dobby died, I could not understand why someone didn't try to help him.  They just sat there looking sad at him.  Harry has been injured badly several times, and they always manage to heal him back up...but Dobby isn't worth it?<br /><br />It really was too long.  I hate how all 'serious' movies seem like they are required to be over 2 hours long anymore.  This one, with a lot of material, could be justifiably long, but if I find myself sitting in the theatre hoping for it to end, then in my opinion the story or the director has at least partially failed.  I enjoyed the movie, but I still felt I was in that theatre for about 4 hours, and the last 30 minutes of the film every time the screen went dark I prayed that it was over.  I know that sounds conflicted, but its how I felt about it.<br /><br />I also hate the ""shaky camera"" fad in movies over the last decade.  This one wasn't too bad about it, but it felt like all of the non-action scenes were filmed with a little flip camera by a high school student.  I wanted to shout at the director to invest in a tripod.<br /><br />My only other minor complaint is that the director seemed to really enjoy having the bad guys straddle the good guys (dead or alive), and it felt awkward.<br /><br />I still really liked it, but I won't be watching it again til it comes out on DVD, whereas previous installations I have seen in the theatre several times.  I will, of course, go see the second part, but I don't really look forward to it.  I dont want all the characters to die off.  I almost hope that pt 2 will be a classic example of hollywood rewriting so that at least a few of the good background people live.<br /><br />To address the complaints of ""confusing"", my advice is to watch the first 6 movies.  its part 7.  its not supposed to be a stand alone.  if you've watched the first 6 movies, then its really not confusing at all.<br /><br />so, to sum up (now that I've complained enough)<br />Pros:<br />great acting<br />true to book<br />good story<br />enjoyable<br /><br />cons:<br />shaky camera<br />too long (multiple ""false"" ending spots)<br />awkward scenes that didn't 'fit'.<br /><br />go see it in the theatre. its as worth the 10 buck admission price as any other movie of recent release.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

After the first two in the series, I stopped going because it all became a bore and my sons both grew up and decided the HP movies stunk (which I agreed with). Yes, the kids in the movie are no longer kids and the movie does attempt to show the angst, temptations, jealousies, etc.... of teens BUT the movie is still a bore.  Maybe in the theaters it was better, but on TV, scenes look too dark and the special effects don't look too special.  As for character developments and acting - well the actors try do the best with the material but there is nothing noteworthy in any of their scenes and everything drags right up to the final scene. You can take this LONG movie, cut at least an hour out of it and not miss a single point the movie is trying to make - which isn't much.  This is one of those ""disposable"" movies - things look serious, actors act serious, everything is dark and gloomy but, in the end, it's all pointless.  The minute you finish watching the movie is the minute you start to forget all about it.<br /><br />Update: Went and saw Part 2 - enjoyed it. You're not missing out on much by skipping Part 1.

This way they can include everything from the last book and make it into a fitting end to one of the greatest franchises that we've seen in awhile. The Deathly Hallows Part 1 picks up where the Half Blood Prince leaves off and starts off with alot of action. The characters we've grown with through each and every single movie have grown up as well. We learn in this movie how much they think of each other and how much their lives intertwine with everything in the world of Harry Potter.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 does not disappoint! While I wish each part of the final installment were 3 hours long, the flow of this film is good and your left wanting more.

It's entirely a buildup to the final chapter, which will, hopefully, be more exciting to watch. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is 2 1/2 hours of a dark lit, hard to see road picture. Very little of the enchantment, humor and wondrous effects are present. For the time spent, not much happens. It consists of Harry, Ron & Hermione walking from one point to the next, looking for and destroying one Horcrux while camping out in a tent. It could all have been condensed into a movie less than 1/2 the time. Of course then the makers of it would have made less money than they did by stretching one movie's worth of story into two movies. After spending time at the edge of my seat being thrilled by the previous 6 movies which seemed almost too short, this one is shockingly dull and had me looking at my watch wondering if it would never end. I recommend you ask someone who's seen it to update you what happens in this one - it should take about one minute to describe the important facts, instead of wasting 2 1/2 hours you can't get back.

Sure, we watch it because we love the books and characters and yes I will see part II for the same reason, but this movie is not well done.

4943215,B004WMKSH2, A3DSI9OTIHJCZF,4.0, Probably the best 'movie' in the series,"Harry Potter 7, while a great movie, has a couple of minor flaws that detract from the experience. Some of these issues arise from the MAJOR plotlines left blank in previous series. For example, Bill is forced into the series at the last moment, because whoever directed the 4th and 6th movies thought he wasn't too important. This is similar to the way Ginny was pushed into the 6th movie; I noticed that almost as soon as that movie began, Ginny was noticeably having a much bigger role. Dobby's thread was also forced. Another problem I had was with some of the acting. A good portion of it (Mad Eye Moody, Ms. Weasley) simply feels forced, and unnatural.<br /><br />But aside from these somewhat minor complaints, this movie looks fantastic. The cinematography is astounding. Previous movies felt a bit closed-in and limited by the walls of Hogwarts, but here the camera is free to roam , and plays a  major role in drawing the viewer in. In the Forest of Dean, when the 'Snatchers' are chasing Harry and co., and just throughout the movie, the cinematics make it so much more enjoyable.<br /><br />So, I feel like some of the errors from previous movies are starting to catch up to the ending, but the movie is still extremely enjoyable.<br /><br />Can't wait till July! :D",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943220,B004WMKSH2, A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,4.0, A Return to Form,"I like all six of the previous Harry Potter films, but I'm not a big fan of what director, David Yates, has done with the last two installments. Maybe it's just the source material, which I have yet to read, but while the stories have gotten darker (which I like), they have also become less interesting. I do understand that the innocence of the early films can't remain for the plot or characters to progress.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is very well done. Sure there are some overlong sequences, too many characters forgotten about due to the huge cast, and I do miss seeing Hogwarts, but judging by the first half of the final chapter, it's going to end on a high note. The main trio have all grown as actors in more ways than one. All of the supporting players we've seen over the years are a welcome sight, but like I said before, often given too little to say or do.<br /><br />The CGI is impressive, yet not overdone, the music still remains gripping, but most important of all, I actually care about the characters and what lies in store for them in Deathly Hallows: Part 2.<br /><br />Here's my ranking of the seven films thus far...<br /><br />1. The Prisoner of Azkaban<br />2. The Goblet of Fire<br />3. The Sorcerer's Stone<br />4. The Deathly Hallows: Part 1<br />5. The Chamber of Secrets<br />6. The Half-Blood Prince<br />7.

If you are really, really into everyone being green, this is the film for you.  It was also way too long, though this is really the fault of J. K. Rowling.

I however did see the first movies from beginning to end all in theater. This is one of the best Harry Potter movies. I am glad they are doing the movies in parts because it just makes more since since the book is so long. If you are a Harry Potter fan you are sure to love this movie.

4943228,B004WMKSH2, A3SYCQ2097VZSY,1.0, Miserable Misdirection - Logic Errors and Poor Pacing,"I hated this movie, I really did.  Here is why:<br /><br />****SPOILER****<br /><br />*there is a massive logic error in that when Hermonie spells Harry and all are captured nobody seems to realize that Hermonie and Ron means Harry is there too, especially since the makeup job on Harry was so obvious to make it clear to every single person watching this film that the game was up.  Yet, all the other characters remain blissfully unaware even though the snatchers seemed to realize who they had.  Now, you can argue that maybe Draco didn't want, in his heart, to give them up but obviously Draco's father did - and he knew Hermonie and Ron by sight (and what about Pettigrew?  Did he just loose his mind?).  This made absolutely no sense but it was absolutely central to the plot.  To compound the error, Bellatrix writes the name 'mudblood' in Hermonie's skin which makes it clear that she recognized who Hermonie was (otherwise, what's the point of doing this?) but nope - they all had an incredible case of the stupids.  Blame the director, cause obviously he didn't care one way or the other in making this believable.<br /><br />*the entire sequence in the Ministry of Magic should have been spine-tingling but instead was lifeless and lacking in any danger or drama.  I was shocked that the director managed to suck the life of what could have been the absolute highlight of the movie, especially the riveting sequence in the book when Harry saves countless people from the dementors but in this movie an epic sequence is reduced to - what - 60 seconds?  What a waste!<br /><br />*it was boring.  Let's admit it, this movie didn't flow like the 4th film or any of the others, with pacing dreadfully dull and lost opportunities galore from the books.  It was telling that the best part of the movie was the Deathly Hallows cartoon sequence where for once the director showed some imagination and style.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie didn't feature anything else inspiring.<br /><br />All in all, I found this movie incredibly disappointing and an absolute disservice to the original material.<br /><br />Oh, and I agree on the special features and packaging - it was absolutely disgraceful.<br /><br />P.S.  It was pointed out that the book had an explanation for the logic error, but the funny thing is that was in the book, NOT the movie.  There was NEVER any hint that V had a nasty temper regarding inappropriate or missing Harry sightings - quite the opposite was implied!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

But if you're a buyer considering paying this amount for it, shame on yourself. You can watch the extras on you tube and they're not much to look at. Some day I'll end up with blu ray probably. I bought the combo pack when WB refused to make this a wide regular dvd release.

On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale -- the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became ""the Boy Who Lived.""

Hermione Granger, consistently the most powerful, came over as an absolute wimp and just let the assault happen complete with Bonnie Langford's Violet Elizabeth Bott """"I'll thcream and thcream 'till I'm thick""""  The only sad part is the death of Dobby.<br />It did not bode well for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 which was marginally better than part 1!!!!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

In all honesty I did not like the Deathly Hallows part 1 as well as I did the rest of the series.  But over time it grew on me, and I can watch it.  But it would not have earned a 4 star rating if not for the fact that I just saw Deathly Hallows part 2.  Anything I would have stated negatively about part 1 was erased immediately.  The producers of the film had no choice but to split the story in two parts.  At first I thought it was for the money, but that is not the case.  Sure there is about 30 minutes of this movie, I thought was a waste of film stock, so it could have been made a little shorter and still had the same impact.  However, overall for fans of the books (which I have never read); this was the only way for the movie to go.<br /><br />Now for the part I really wanted to write about.  If you have not seen Deathly Hallows part 2, go see it!!!!  It is (in my opinion) the best movie of the entire series!  I knew quite a bit about it from reading snippets of the books from various sites, but never realized how great the story actually was.  What surprises me even more is that I was not at first a fan of the series.  The first film I found a little too childish. The second one was better, but then again it was still a bit childish for my taste. However, as the series progressed, I will say this is a must own series for anyone.  In fact (like Star Trek, and soon like Star Wars) I plan to own these movies on both DVD and Blu Ray so that the films can be watched in different rooms that might not be equipped with a Blu Ray player.<br /><br />I will not go into this review any further due to the amount of secrets this film and it's sequel reveal.  After seeing the latest one, and this one back to back, I think I will have to go back and rewatch the entire series in order again.  This movie and the newest one is the perfect ending for an excellent story.<br /><br />Enough said.  Just buy it, it is worth it.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

4943245,B004WMKSH2, AMX4202M7D7HV,3.0," Latest Potter installment excites yet mildly disappoints, and fails to be the highest point in the franchise.","Perhaps this stems from the fact that ""Deathly Hallows"" was kind of a bummer climax to a great book series, one that failed to meet my expectations as a fan, and failed to rank as 5-star reading, coming from an author that had astounded me in the past with her exceptionalism in the quality of her literary output. The novel was slow-moving, often dragging itself to a complete halt before starting itself up again on a lame footing, and then tumbling to an unexciting and open-ended finale.<br /><br />Not that I dislike the movie so much. It is merely that the film suffers solely from the problems of the book: an over-stretched and ridiculous plot (or lack thereof); a slow moving narrative, which took up over 700 pages when it easily could have used up only 300; and a ruthless extermination of nearly half the population of the Wizarding World in a single brutal sweep by Rowling herself. That being said, if you can disregard the seriously lacking storyline and nonexistent plot, ""Hallows, Part 1"" comes off as a fairly good film.<br /><br />I have really come to appreciate why the production team chose to split it into two halves. While the tone of the next film is ostensibly going to be full of more fast-paced, action-packed thrills with lots of heroics and explosions, this first part is slower moving, with a kind of stationary adventure taking place outside of Hogwarts, a first for the books and the films. It is easily the darkest of all the films, with bleak, somber scenery, and as dark a tale to match. The characters are more fully explored, particularly the three young heroes, and their depth adds another, more mature element to the story.<br /><br />Be prepared to shed a few tears, and to cover your eyes and your ears during some of the more horrific moments. I was especially creeped out by the scenes at Bathilda Bagshot's house, and the sequence of Bellatrix torturing Hermione at Malfoy Manor. The gristle and gore is quickly apparent, with frightening scenes of blood and death almost from the get-go (all courtesy of J.K. Rowling's book, I might add).  But considering the film was created by a team made up mostly of men and born from Rowling's imagination, I am thankful it wasn't any worse. While the same bad stuff happens, its been toned down to suit a PG-13 rating, and the gruesome shots never last more than a few seconds.<br /><br />You do have to give yourself time to get used to being out of your element--like the book, you never get to see Hogwarts castle. Being a ""road"" picture, most of the story takes place during what seems like an extended camping trip. The main focus is the three kids and their quest to destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes, though what they do accomplish in the stretch of two and a half hours is precious little. While an improvement from the book, I was surprised afterward how much time it took for so little to happen, even though it seemed like things were in constant motion. The action is spread over numerous campsites across the country, with bits of action, character development, and plot exposition thrown in. Not the most inspiring setting, but it works better in a movie than I thought it would.<br /><br />Regarding the script, Steven Kloves remained exceedingly faithful to J.K. Rowling's story, with the Deathly Hallows still taking front seat,  and everything else following, for better or worse. He is also equally as ruthless, sparing no one and leaving every death (all 6) in place that she put into what makes up the first installment. Even so, there are several changes which made for a great improvement to the plot. For instance, things move quicker leading up to the recovery of the first Horcrux. The pacing is shored up and sheared considerably from the book, where as I said before it dragged and dragged until it came to a complete halt. The film never stops moving, and often leaves you completely breathless. It is easily ten times more exciting than how it was written. To put it one way, I knew everything that was going to happen, yet I sat on the edge of my seat biting my nails the entire time. Little time is spent at either the Dursley's or the Burrow; Harry's birthday is completely skipped over; and Bill and Fleur's wedding is also condensed considerably. The time within Grimmauld place is robbed of screen-time but loaded with tension; the few moments inside are as nerve-wracking as any taking place in the forest outside.<br /><br />The strained relationship between Harry, Ron, and Hermione felt monotonous and after a while unbelievable in the book, but because the acting of the three stars is so strong, it works in the movie. Amongst the discord, there is a sense of unity between the three friends. Harry doesn't argue so much with the other two and is less belligerent. The fights between he and Ron have been paired down to one, and he seems to be more understanding of Hermione's feelings in particular, making their special bond even more poignant. I really enjoyed several moments where he finally stands up and acts like a man, particularly the sequence where he comforts a downtrodden Hermione by dancing with her, a nice addition by Kloves that wasn't in the original book.<br /><br />You can really see Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint coming into their own as actors. Watson is perhaps the best out of the three, carrying so many emotions at one time it's hard to keep up. Grint does an equally commendable job with Ron's conflicting emotions and his wavering faith in Harry, and often provides some well-timed comic relief. Radcliffe seems to be more comfortable in his role than the previous films, and as a consequence, Harry seems to have matured considerably, growing as a person and developing another layer of depth and complexity that adds even more interest to his character. For instance, after the face-off with Nagini at Godric's Hollow, Hermione shows Harry the bits of his broken wand. Instead of blowing up at her and acting like an ungrateful prig as he does in the book, he acts far more accepting, actually thanking her for saving their lives instead of bawling her out.<br /><br />Even though many, many technical advancement have been made since the earlier movies, I found the special effects for this one a bit too cartoonish. Dobby and Kreacher's faces looked far too human to be house-elves, and not quite as magical as in films 2 and 5. The shadow-puppet-like animation for tale of the Three Brothers was very odd, and I felt it detracted from the story too much.<br /><br />Of all of the alterations made to the plot, my one complaint was that Kloves chose not to spare Dobby, the poor, good-natured house-elf who gets mercilessly killed at Belltrix's hands, an unnecessary moment from the book that really galled me. In the film, it was painful to watch Harry call out to Hermione to help him, and watch as she does nothing. Rowling frequently contradicts herself, and this was one of the worst.  How is it Hermione could stop Ron from bleeding to death after he was splinched, or save Harry from a near-fatal snake bite, yet she can't help a house-elf that was wounded with an ordinary dagger? It would have been such an easy change--I really wish the film had ended better.<br /><br />As a movie, I can't complain. It had good acting, good cinematography, fairly good music, good visual effects, and a great production crew. It was a marked improvement from the book itself, and while maybe not as marked as I would have liked, it is nonetheless something I would consider re-viewing. If it lacks, it is in no way the fault of the filmmakers. They did the best they could with the material given to them. Let's just hope the next time around (Part 2), will improve upon the source instead of slavishly adhering to it.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

In a series with such a large cast and such a convoluted storyline, it is good to see a renewed emphasis on character.  This is the brilliance in spreading this final episode out over two films (apart from the extra dollars to be made).  Many of the other films have felt rushed, and the scenes in which our heroes camp out in isolation would surely have been greatly curtailed if not cut altogether without the breathing room this approach provides.  I appreciate that director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves did not pack in a few more breathless escapes or big action set pieces.  Instead, we have a chance to get reacquainted with the three protagonists and spend some quiet time with them before the explosive climax that is sure to come.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943252,B004WMKSH2, A1NJNHOR3P4A3C,1.0, Disappointing,"Not only is this the weakest film, despite the length and despite the hype by all of those who are high on WB/Yates Kool-Aid, but its DVD is the worst packaged of the franchise, with no extras.  When it arrived in the mail yesterday from Amazon, I had to re-check the return address because I thought it was a bootleg copy that had been sent by mistake.  The sound and picture quality are sub-par as well.<br /><br />I learned from reading the comments to other one-star reviews here that the sort of DVD release we have come to expect for a Harry Potter film (two-discs, widescreen, etc.) is only available from Walmart. Had I known, I would not have wasted my money signing up for a pre-sale from Amazon. Unfortunately, I opened it, so I can't send it back.<br /><br />After watching it, I can say I am still not happy with the adaptation of this film from its source.  For all its length, it is dreadfully paced, seeming simultaneously rushed and draggy, and it has left out at least as many important themes and scenes as any of the earlier films.  Scenes are added willy-nilly, too, which is not in and of itself a crime, but only a crime when the tacky new material replaces the brilliant original.<br /><br />Steve Kloves is no J.K. Rowling, and should stop trying to ""improve"" on the better writer's work.<br /><br />******SPOILER AHEAD******<br /><br />The film cuts an important scene that is one of the first in the book, and that is the tete-a-tete between Harry and Dudley as the Dursleys depart from Privet Drive. That scene would have added so much more to the film in terms of character development than the film's made-up opening scene of Hermione erasing herself from her parents' photos and memories. Much has been made of that Hermione scene, but I was not impressed and thought it raised more questions than it answered. In the book, Hermione mentions in conversation how she transported her parents to Australia, changed their names, and wiped their memories clean of the idea they had ever had a daughter. In the movie, it seems that the parents remain in their English house. So what happens when the neighbors ask the Grangers about their daughter? Or did Hermione supposedly perform memory charms on all the neighbors, too? And how does simply wiping the parents' memories supposedly protect them -- or Hermione -- anyway; aren't they still vulnerable to Death Eaters who might want to hurt them in order to hurt Hermione, regardless of whether they remember her?<br /><br />I am tired of people going on about how this scene brought tears to their eyes. I am as sentimental as anyone can be, but I found the scene bogus. For an authentic emotional statement, give me Dudley and his handshake and his ""Dunno"" and his teacup.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943253,B004WMKSH2, A38JWSLCF9AYOZ,5.0, A 12-year-old's review,"The final Harry Potter movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, is an adaptation of the darkest book in the series. It only makes sense that the film is also going to be the darkest of its series. Harry Potter 7 was felt by the production crew to be so complex, despite not being the longest book in the series, that they reached a decision to split the film into two parts. So far, the first part, despite being out for only 8 days, has grossed about $400M. Now, onto the actual review! Im spite of the decision to split the film into two parts, everything still couldn't be included. It's best to judge it only as a movie, like the others, rather than as an adaptation of the book. My rating of the movie is 5 out of 5 stars. One of the reasons is that the characters have greatly developed from what they once were. Character development is always very important to anything that has characters, and no character development usually makes you not care about the characters at all! An example of this is Severus Snape. In the first two books and movies, Snape is purely hateable. There is a bit of humor behind the fact that Snape is so detestable. For instance, Snape makes up new rules just to have an excuse to take points off Gryffindor. In the third book and movie, it shows that Snape wasn't always to blame though. One time, he was almost killed, as a prank. In the fourth, it's shown that Snape is a spy for Dumbledore. In The Order of the Phoenix, despite the fact that Snape is even worse to Harry than usual, without him Harry would be in a much worse predicament than he was, at the end of the book (and film). In the sixth one, it's very obvious that he's evil. For those who haven't read the book, I won't spoil it, however Snape is still more complex than good or bad. Another example of character development is the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. My final example is how Dobby came from being a miserable house elf who usually got Harry injured in his attempts to help him, to a worker at Hogwarts. Dobby then strives to return the favor. Another reason this film merits a 5-star rating is the little touches added to the adaptation. For instance, the scene with Harry and Hermione dancing, after Ron leaves. Another such touch is the animation going with The Tale of the Three Brothers, when it is read aloud by Hermione. The film ended perfectly, leaving you wanting more. Nevertheless, it's very aggravating that we'll have to wait about 7 months to see the next one! In my opinion, the film was made stronger by introducing the Hallows themselves in this first act, rather than squeezing them into the second and making it look like an afterthought. The acting, for the next example of the film's rating, is superlative and stupendous. Every single person was perfect for their role and, if I were the director, I would not cast anyone else. The visuals are also great, ranging from black gloominess to a busy ministry to nice beaches and to snowy forests. These are only a few reasons why I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows earns a 5-star rating.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The movie ran 2 hours and 26 minutes; Longer than some movies but shorter than other epics such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  And for an extra 15 minutes the movie could have stayed more true to the books.  I would have sat there for another hour had it followed the book better.  By taking short cuts, they lost some of the charm that JK Rowling created. Why didn't someone cry foul when this was being filmed?  Or did this happen during editing?

I think it may be one of, if not the best film in the franchise thus far.<br /><br />The choice to split the final story into two parts paid off; the details, nuances that cropped up throughout the film were all possible because the film had time to work them in.  Even things that might have escaped the notice of people who didn't read the books, they're there for those of us who did (i.e. Hermione's reference to perfume; the perfume Ron gave her for her birthday).  I also firmly believe that the kids, the stars (Radcliffe, Grint, Watson, Felton, etc.) have never given better performances.  They clearly handled this film (and, likely, its companion due out next year) with extreme care.  It shows, and I, for one, am grateful.<br /><br />I've heard several reviews that say the film is laden down with too much plot, too many devices, details and new information, but that's hardly its own fault; the book presents all of those things originally.  Yes, the book had more pages than the film has screen time, but considering how much the book introduces here in the home stretch, how many new things have to be incorporated and made known, it seemed to work well.  Things got cut, and things got altered, but in ways that worked and, in the end, leaves us with a film that is gripping and heartfelt.<br /><br />My full review (with my takes on the good, the bad and the ugly) can be found here: [...]",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The books are highly evolved AND involved, way too much content to try and cram into a cluster of a movie.  I thought movies 1-6 were incredibly done and I fought tooth and nail with ""real"" fans who thought they were so cool because they had read the books before the movies even came out and would bash everyone who liked the movies because the ""movies left too much out"".  But this movie, I will NOT defend in the same way.<br /><br />Why?  Because it is garbage made with one purpose and that is this: $$$.  Lets see how we can keep our costs low and our earning high.  I thought the purpose of splitting this story into 2 movies was so that it could be exceptionally detailed and leave it all on the floor for the finale.  This is the closer for freaking Harry Potter, both movies could have been 3-4 hours long and people would have never even blinked the whole time!  Don't say you couldn't do more because you didn't have the right time frame.<br /><br />The entire story is rushed.  Key events are left out (Krum and Harry's talk at the wedding, Kreature's major role, the insight to the Deathly Hallows) or changed, such as the scene with Wormtail.  That was an incredible part in the book, why did we just simply knock him out?!  It seems like the characters are uncomfortable with their lines and just trying to blurt them out as quickly as possible.  My heart was racing for the chase scene in the beginning but that was the most boring pile of crap I've ever seen!  When I read the Deathly Hallows and Hagrid fell from his broom, I was sure he was dead.  Everything pointed that direction, and when he was found to be alive, it was like the 2nd coming to me. But in this movie?  Oh no, lets cut that out so we can put Bill in here saying ""Hi, my name's Bill, I was attacked by a werewolf"", no better way of getting some back story than that huh?<br /><br />I bet Rowling is pissed.  Sources tell me she has a history of being unhappy with the movies, especially for downplaying the elves and after what they did to Kreature I'm sure she'd like to come down with the hammer of the gods.  Please I beg you before watching this, if you have not read the books READ THEM so people like me aren't having to sit there with a whole group of people and explain every freaking detail because the POS movie left out most every important fact that you need to know!<br /><br />Someone answer me this question, who was the cool looking snatcher guy with the long hair?  See, I read the book and I don't even know who that is!  Can someone please PLEASE reboot this movie?  Hell we are redoing Spider-Man, why not give a little more forethought into a work of literature that has pretty much been a major history mark for a generation?<br /><br />Did this movie really not deserve a little more thought and time?  Did we really have to rush it?  I will say that yes, there is a lot of downtime in the book that wouldn't have been interesting enough for movie scenes but come on!!! Part 2 better be the best movie ever made or then I will know for a FACT these movies were made with the all mighty dollar sign in eyes and I will forever lose faith in novel adaptations.<br /><br />This movie is OK for people who haven't read the books but I think even Potter fans that have never read a book in their life will notice this just isn't up to par.

It just kills me that Yates and Co. were brought back for the rest of the series.<br /><br /> The director seems to think that a ""dark story"" means insufficient lighting in a film. This movie seems to be lit by candle light. You can't see the actors or the magnificent sets at all. The writing and direction is lackluster at best.<br /><br /> I get it that things must be left out in order to make a book into a movie, story lines must be changed somewhat in order to do this, but there is no excuse for adding things that weren't in the book, while dropping important parts that were.  It is like the best parts of the book were changed or left out entirely, and all of the slower parts of the book were extended as far as they could go, and then extended some more.<br /><br /> There are parts in the book could have been explored in more detail, which would have made this movie truer to form, and much more exciting. They have however, taken the vision and the promise of an extremely good book, cut out all of the pages, wrote a few chapters of their own, and sewn everything back in some haphazard manner. It is completely lacking in the qualities that made the book so good. The awful screenwriting seems to have taken it's toll even on the most talented actors, and the entirety of the film comes out as one drab mess. Director David Yates and his team seem to think that they can write the story better than J. K. Rowling...<br /><br /> They should have hired someone out of high school to direct and write the screenplay, or better yet, stuck with Alfonso Cuaron (Prisoner Of Azkaban) and his team. OMG if this wasn't a Harry Potter film, no one would have gone to see it. It has become a sad ending to a wonderful story. Seriously.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943283,B004WMKSH2, A1IP6NRVCQP7ZA,1.0, Could not wait until is was over!,"Let me first start out that I do not read the books, I just watch the movies. I have always found the movies good entertainment and good movies in which to have children watching. In fact I have always look at the Harry Potter movies as children's movies along the lines of the Wizard of Oz from my day. However this movie was a chore to watch. I keep looking at the time remaining to see when it would end. The acting was amateurish, the lighting terrible and a poor transition to DVD with too much pixilation and a story hard to follow. This movie was too dark, moody and I hate to say it, a little too violent. This is not a movie I would want my kid to watch. It was nowhere in keeping with the genre of the other Harry Potter movies. What a waste of money and time watching this painfully BAD movie. This just seem to be a way for the franchise to cash in on the popularity of the other movies and they could care less if the movie was any good. It is like they just wanted to get something out so they can get the money from the movie and the movie tie-in games. If you don't agree with this assessment fine as this is MY opinion about this movie, Not your opinion! Base on some comments I guess some people still do not GET I. I am making a opinion on the Movie NOT the book. Very few movies based on books are true to the book. Books take hours to read movies do not! As a movie that is part of the Harry Potter franchise and comparing it to the other Harry Potter movies I think this one is TERRIBLE!!!!!!! I do like all the other movies in the Harry Potter franchise!",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943284,B004WMKSH2, A1FSLE0YF3BKVQ,2.0, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt 1,"Let me preface this by saying that I have not liked a Harry Potter movie since Chamber of Secrets, the last one that Chris Columbus directed. Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets truly felt magical, filled with spells, unusual creatures, and wizards' robes. You really felt like you were in fantasy world. Understandably, as the series progresses the tone gets less happy and sparkly, and more ominous and gloomy. I don't think that should mean the magic factor has to be downplayed, or at least keep them in wizard garb. From Prisoner of Azkaban on they all look just like like regular kids at some boarding school in Europe, who just happen to have wands. Most of them shouldn't even know what muggle clothes look like, let alone sport the latest fashions.<br /><br />I did myself a disservice by rereading the book right before seeing the movie. As a total HP geek I of course want the movies to retain all details, but I realize that each movie would have to be about eight hours long for that to be possible. While reading there were many times where I thought, I wonder how they'll translate this info to film, and turns out their answer was to simply cut it. In the book we learn a great deal about Dumbledore's past, his family, and his connection to Grindelwald - the great dark wizard before Voldemort. The movie glosses over these things, mentioning them in passing without explanation. Instead they chose to waste time by drawing out the camping trips and adding in extraneous scenes like an impromptu dance session between Harry and Hermione. They also didn't have the kids using the Invisibility Cloak at all, while in the book they spent practically all their time traveling under that thing. While I can see from a cinematic standpoint that you can't have your main characters invisible for most of the film, it seemed like a strange thing to leave out entirely since the Cloak is actually one of the Deathly Hallows. I was, however, really impressed with the animation of the fable, The Three Brothers. For a moment I was afraid they were just going to have Hermione sit there and read it to us, but the little cartoon was a nice break in the film and was very artistic. It was surprising to me how gory this film was; they showed George's damaged ear and Ron's splinching in all their bloody glory, and even The Three Brothers tale (a children's story) was quite grisly and grim. I guess they didn't rate it PG-13 for nothing.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, I couldn't get over how old the kids looked. It feels weird to even call them ""kids."" Harry has a perpetual five 'o clock shadow, Ron is gargantuan, and Hermione seems to have fallen out of a J. Crew catalog.  All in all, it wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't great either. There were definitely a lot of moments that I enjoyed, but I think too many important details were left out or changed that I can't reasonably give this a good review.<br /><br />[...]",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Awful.,"It must be possible these days to feed a text into a machine which transfers words directly to images because, unlike the previous films, Deathly Hallows Part 1 almost resembles the first half of the novel exactly.  This unfortunately does not work in the film's favor, precisely because the trend of the last few films was to dispense with a great deal of material from the books (and consequently improve upon them) in favor of giving us films which were incoherent as a series but which, for the most part, stood well on their own aesthetically.  And while this more impressionistic style of film-making didn't sit well with the Harry Potter purists, cinematically it was very respectable.  Now, however, the filmmakers have decided to give the purists what they want . . . to the detriment of the film, not least because Deathly Hallows the novel was such a mess to begin with.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

The thing I disliked about Part One is they kept on showing them in various tents all over the place.  Boring!!! Oh let's see Harry in a tent in a forest, oh how about a different forest!  Of all the films I actually fell asleep in this one, because of all the repetitive tent scenes.

4943290,B004WMKSH2, A2MHZ4ASSTXPMW,2.0, Disgusting aberration from the actual story,"I realize that some things must change when you adapt a book to the big screen, but what was done to this particular book is appalling. Over the years the book to movie transition has steadily declined with this series and here the story is almost unrecognizable. I believed, I hoped, that splitting this book into two parts the powers that be would use the time to set right what they had failed in the other movies. To go back and explain key elements of the story and characters that they had glossed over before. But no, what they did was give us two hours of post-apocalyptic feely-type imagery and 3 teenagers roaming witlessly around the english countryside apparently without a clue between them - and very little magic either. JK Rowling wrote pages of clever dialogue in which these characters wrestle with their deepest fears and struggle with the smallest of clues that Dumbledore left them to unravel in order to defeat Voldemort. They planned and discussed and sacrificed. Harry went head to head with the minister of magic on moral principal. It took Harry months to convince Hermione to go to Godric's Hollow. But in the movie they do everything on a whim. It's all based on luck. Yates makes them look like idiots. This is the thing I find most offensive. And for a movie based on a magical world it seemed oddly lacking in magic. The Sorcerer's Apprentice had more magic in the first 5 minutes than the entire HP film. I will see the final installment because I need to finish this, but I am sorely disappointed. It's like watching a Cliff's notes version of a book you love. The heart and soul of the story is missing. The characters have been reduced to their lowest common denominators. If you haven't read any of the books do yourself a favor and don't start now. You will only know what you are missing. Wait until you have seen all the movies. Then read the actual story.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1
4943291,B004WMKSH2, AXSH6O4OP5L4M,3.0, Disappointng,"I really enjoyed not only the stories in the Harry Potter series but also the great talent and forethought that went into creating them.  Each book speaks to a different age group in terms it can understand and does so in a vocabulary that stretches the growing reader without boring the mature reader to death.  Syntax gradually becomes more complex with each book, and the social issues faced at each age are presented realistically if not in the context of reality.  The plot structure is respected, with a beginning, middle and end that show continuity and respect for the reader.  Up until now, each of the films has also respected the story teller's art and the fictional work itself.  By these criteria, however, this installment of the film series is a dismal failure.<br /><br />The public relations for the film suggest that two parts were ""required"" to adequately present the book, but I disagree.  Two parts were necessary to adequately squeeze every last possible penny out of the franchise, and it is painfully obvious.  Part of the film maker's job is to translate the words and pages and the narrative episodes of a written work into a visual work that captures the story in a meaningful way, keeping the story on track by editing episodes where appropriate.  That doesn't seem to have happened here.  What we have is a meaningless bridge from the previous story to the d&eacute;nouement, a bridge we really didn't need and one that seems purposeless. The viewer ends up feeling like he took one of the stairways at Hogwarts, and it redirected him to a floor he hadn't intended on going to!<br /><br />The present film is more of a picture piece than a work of fiction.  Those who enjoy glorious filmography and natural settings will be pleased with the work, as it is definitely eye candy in this respect.  CGI buffs will also receive what they have come to expect by way of special effects in this series.  Those who have come to expect the drama of growing up into adulthood will be very disappointed.  The adult responsibilities and relationships, the personal losses, and the expectations of individuals against the grander background of world events that the final book portrays is somewhat lacking here.  There's a big build up, but nothing really happens that needs to have been enlarged on to the extent of a full 2  hour film.<br /><br />The young people have started on their search for the parts of Voldamort's soul stashed in various objects, but most of the film has them ""camping out"" in lovely locations while trying to come to some plan of action.  Quarrels ensue, separations result, true camaraderie wins out and everyone comes together again, but other than that, not very much happens that forwards the story.  We've already seen the tiny tent with the capacious interior, of which Hermione's purse is just another version.  We've already gotten used to the concept of invisibility; we know that magic can be deadly and wicked people do wicked things.  The story has no beginning, middle or end.  The film just seems to mark time.<br /><br />Anyone collecting the films will hardly miss this one if they choose to have only the second part.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1

Both movies also lack a driving narrative.  In MotP, the penguins just go back and forth because that's what they do.  Here, the trio look for horacruxes because...well, because...well, because they have to!<br /><br />It was nice to look at, the acting is fine, and I am eager for Part 7.

Note to the actors: staring off into the distance with a perpetually concerned expression does not qualify as good acting! Nor does a dark, moody atmosphere qualify for a mature movie. I'm tired of this grossly misguided philosophy that ""dark"" somehow equals ""mature"" or ""adult"". Anything but a mature work, HPATDH plays as if it were written by an untalented teenager, with no sense of pacing, character, or where to place emphasis.<br />The movie also suffers from a severe case of tonal inconsistency, mixing bad comedy with eye-rolling melodrama. And should I mention the effects? No, let's be nice. Let's just say I have the strong suspicion that most of the budget ended up in the actor's pockets.<br /><br />I am amazed at how easily people are amused by this over-blown kiddie matinee.<br /><br />Don't like my review?

4943299,B004WMKSH2, A21ADOKXYYAGM5,3.0, A fair adaption with a few flaws *Spoiler alert!!!!!!!*,"Ok looks like I'm the first one to write a review. :D I just saw it in the midnight showing. Unfortunately I didn't get to see it in 3D because some dimwit decided to get the plain imax instead of 3d but whatever. Now to the movie. The part with harry seeing the dursley's off was not in the movie. Amazing, since that's one of the funniest parts of the book. I love seeing harry stand up to the dursleys. :D Um . . . I guess it wasn't too bad. They showed the part with the locket being destroyed and it was done fairly well. I couldn't believe that they got the actual dialogue from the book right because when they are converting it into script they for some reason think it's great to change the dialogue in a part that they show that's actually right. Not only did they get the dialogue right, but they got it in the right order! Amazing. lol.<br />  As for the graphics, they were AMAZING! I loved how they made everything look so real, and made sure that the effects were utilized to their fullest potential. I think my favorite scene with the graphics would have to be the locket, and godricks hollow. Both were amazing.<br />  I really liked that they added hermione's parents to the mix, showing what everyone was doing to prepare to search for horcruxes and such. It put a whole new level of feeling to the whole production. So cutos to those of you who made the movie.<br />  While there are good things to say about the movie, of course there are bad things.<br />  I couldn't believe what I saw at the ministry! I was so mad because when they used the poly juice potion, they became the same people that they plucked hairs from, but they totally screwed it up. Ron goes to derain yaxley's office, that was right, hermione went to the court rooms, and harry went to see umbridges office, but harry didn't take the eye, ron went with him to get hermione, and they all started changing back to themselves right in the middle of the ministry and NO ONE NOTICED! HARRY POTTER IS THE MOST WANTED WIZARD AT THE TIME AND NO ONE NOTICED! IN THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC NO LESS! Can you believe that? I think not.<br />  They never use the invisibility cloak in the movie. Not once. And the only time they show them using the poly juice potion is in the ministery which as all of us potterfans know,  they used in godricks hollow and when they went into gringotts. Oh and we all know that everywhere they went they used the invisibility cloak in case something went wrong.<br />  Oh and instead of disapperating everywhere, they WALKED everywhere! Can you believe that?<br />  Oh and going back to the beginning, you know voldemort's name is taboo, well they didn't even say it and the deatheater's came. They weren't on tottenham court road. They were in some other place apparently. Oh well.<br />  Maybe it's just because I love the harry potter books that I find all these flaws, but I won't spend all night writing them out because there are a lot and you probably don't want to read a review that long with flaws in the movie.<br />  I will say this though . . . if you haven't read the books, it might be a little harder to follow than if you had. I had trouble understanding what the hell I was seeing when I was watching what harry was seeing when he went into voldemort's mind. And they happen so fast . . . you barely have time to register what you're seeing.<br />  I was a little disappointed with this movie, although it is way better than David Yate's tragic failure at producing a good adaption of Harry potter and the order of the pheonix. It was the worst thing they ever could have done to a harry potter book as good as that. Took him three movies to even start getting better at directing them. Shame.<br />  Okay and for all you people who have read this review when I first wrote it, I want to point out that I think this movie was the best adaption by far than the fifth harry potter movie to which I am no fan of. I loved some of the scenes that they had and I loved the fact that they managed not to cut out the most important scenes although I really would have liked to see dedalus diggle and hestia jones. I loved the movie, I am just pointing out things that could cause a problem later. The only real main concern I have is them not using the invisibility cloak because it becomes a big part of the movie later. I mean, it's common sense people, harry potter (the most wanted wizard in the world) is not going to be striding up the street without some sort of concealment where deatheaters are looking for them. Ok? So please, no negative criticizms on the comments? I am merely stating fact. While I give negative feedback, I also give positive, so try to focus on both parts, not just negative.

And where was the soundtrack? there was barely any soundtrack in the movie, you need music to convey some kind of emotion. The way the director did the action scene ( the fighting in the sky) was barely recognizable. I didn't know what was going on. The music to that scene was so off that it puzzled me why the director would go that route instead of a more sinister and intense music. This is why John Williams should have scored the entire movie ( The studio should have paid him double, no triple to keep him rather than let him go). Anyways, after watching DH part 1, there is no hope that DH part 2 would be any better. I truly think that David Yates has destroyed a franchise that could've lasted for decades to come.<br />Oh, forgot one thing: Dobby's death was done so terribly. I felt more sad for cedric dying in Movie 4 than Dobby. Again barely any score was played for him. And then they randomly decided to add Luna to the scene. I'll conclude that the studio obviously is being as cheap as possible in order to increase their profit margin for these films. You could tell that they didn't want to hire a talented director along with talented composer and use the top notch special effect to make these films much better. They know if they make a poor or at best mediocre film that fans would pour into the theaters just to see what they read come to life. They know regardless of the outcome of the product, people would at least see the movie one time. In the short-run this would gain them ample amount of money but in the long-term, the future generation would see how crappy the film are and just might skip it all together. *sigh* it's really a pity that such a franchise that started good has come to such mediocre ending. I gave it two stars because some of the acting were good ( not just from the trio) and ""the tale of the three brothers"" scene. Not for the ministry scene( wasn't suspenseful enough or have the feel like evil has taken over the ministry), or the wedding scene ( a bit too casual instead of tension, No krum, but loved Luna and her father silly dance), or the forest scenes ( too long, should have used those minutes on other scenes like adding Krum discussing about the deathly hallow or when harry and friends were trapped at Malfoy's Manor instead of rushing that scene) or.....

Of course, women will obviously rate it highly for the same reason. Given Rowlings past public comments this let-down was likely inevitable.<br /><br />Examples?

The tension throughout the movie was constant and high. About midway through the film when our heroes were beset once again with trouble, it thought ""ho, hum, there's another set back.""

Everyone has read the books, seen the movies (at least on DVD) and listened to the audio books. We were really, really looking forward to seeing this movie.<br /><br />When we saw the PG-13 rating we sent our eldest son to preview it before we took the rest of the family (kids 11-8). This young adult came back from the theater saying that it was absolutely not for the kids. His biggest complaint: the nude scene of Harry and Hermione. (The scene is in page 376 in the book. Rowling never states they are undress. Why add it to the movie?See comment below) His other scene he found too disturbing for the kids was when Bellatrix tortured Hermione.<br /><br />My husband and I saw the movie (without kids) and found it to be so-so. The movie was at its best when more characters than just Harry, Rom and Hermione were on screen. Looking forward to seeing Part 2.<br /><br />Additional comments/clarifications:<br /><br />I am surprised at the number of comments this review evoked and feel I need to clarify some of my remarks and respond to some of the comments list below this review.<br /><br />1. I did see this movie. My 19 year old son went to the midnight showing opening night. My husband and I attended the following evening.<br />2. I actually have not read other reviews. I guess I knew I was going to this movie whether other people liked it or not.<br />3. It is true that the nude scene consists of Harry and Hermoine's bare shoulders, with smoke covering the rest of them. They are entwined in an embrace. It is not a scene most parents of elementary age kids (or at least this parent) finds appropriate and it probably contributed a great deal to the pg-13 rating. (OK, that and Nagini indwelling Bathilda Bagshot)<br />  Here is the thing, in the later Harry Potter books there is some snogging (kissing for you non-Brits), but J.K. Rowling choose not to go beyond that. I simply wished the filmmaker took the same route.<br />4. Yes, we all know the books mature as Harry get older. They get darker as well. Still, filmmakers were able to make a PG rated movie out of book 6,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PMV9FG"">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition)</a>/(as well as books 1-3). I guess I was hoping for the same for Deathly Hallows, Part 1.<br /><br />Look, there were some great performances and moments in this movie.

And this one was too boring.  Over half of the movie they are stranded on the side of a mountain or a hill waiting for Harry to figure out how to destroy a Horcrux. There were times when I wondered if J. K. Rowling has seen broke back mountain a few too many times.  If Ron and Harry had been left on the side of the mountain who knows this might have come true.  The movie was good up until the last hour where all you see is them trapped on the side of the hill.  This may have been okay for the readers of the book but not for someone who is only into the movies.

I try to watch the films every now and then to see if I can get a handle on what all the fuss is about. It still eludes me. I was bored through this movie, with one scene standing out as engaging and interesting and having some magic, some sparkle. Obviously, mine is not the majority view.<br /><br />I find Daniel Radcliffe frighteningly cute. He's just a child! Scary. The scene where several Harrys remove their shirts at once - wow. Hand me my fan.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is one of the all-time great film actors. He does evil very well - see ""Schindler's List."" Here he is wearing some kind of CGI no-nose Halloween mask and he doesn't raise so much as one goose pimple. Fiennes could have made this villain, Voldemort, really scary if they had removed the silly make-up/cgi. As it is, you look at him and think, poor guy, some kind of no-nose birth defect. It would be unkind to stare. Hire the differently abled!<br /><br />I had no idea what was going on for most of the movie. I'd read a review saying that Hermione had to erase her family's memories of her, and that that was very poignant. That happens in an opening scene that lasts about a minute. Had I not read the review, I would have had no idea what was happening. Whatever was happening was not poignant to this viewer.<br /><br />I didn't, and still don't, know what a horcrux is. Characters have magical powers, but which characters have which powers? Voldemort wants to kill Harry; Voldemort has magical powers. Why doesn't Voldemort just use his magical powers to kill Harry? What's preventing him? I have no idea, because I don't know how magical powers are apportioned, or resisted, in this world. There's scene after scene of wands and chases and searches and I never knew what anyone could do with what spell or wand, so I didn't know what was at stake and what needed to be done to protect what was at stake. At one point Ron tells Harry ""It's about more than you."" What is it about? Box office revenue.<br /><br />There's a scene where Harry is caught under ice, alone in a forest at night: a real claustrophobe's paranoid nightmare. I found I could watch the scene without any anxiety. Now that's poor filmmaking.<br /><br />There is so much stuff slathered onscreen: eccentric English cottages with floating pears growing outside the front door, magical tents, protective snowy owls, elevators that travel sideways - and I never once said ""Oooo"" or ""Aaaa"" (except for that scene where multiple Harrys bear multiple post-adolescent, nicely muscled, newly hairy chests - ooo baby). Nothing felt magical to me. The ever present onscreen junk all had the same, loud, tacky, K-Mart Christmas feel. ""Less is more"" anyone?<br /><br />There was one scene that worked. I was caught up in it, and, even as I was watching it, I imagined legions of fangirls watching this scene again and again once the home version is released. Harry and Hermione are feeling low. They are alone in a tent in a forest. Music is playing on a staticky radio. The camera focuses on Hermione in the glow of a kerosene lamp. Suddenly, the view of Hermione is blocked by Harry's sweater-clad shoulder. In the same way that he is blocking the scene, he is overwhelming Hermione's consciousness. He extends his hand to her; she rises; they dance, their bodies directed by their despair, their hunger for intimacy with each other, and their fear that satisfying that desire is not a wise idea. It's a truly magical scene, and all too brief.

I went directly to my iTunes account page in the iTunes program and at the bottom of the store screen you should see a click on link that says redeem.  Go to the redeem page through that link and then put in your code directly and that will hopefully work for you.  I just did it last night 2/5/12 and had no trouble at all redeeming my iTunes digital copy.  Hope that it works for you.  As far as the movie, enough has been said about the series this was just to help in case anyone else had issues with their digital copy.  IF for some reason you can't get the iTunes to unlock, try the windows version which would then open up under windows media player.  One thing with the windows copy, however, is that they are computer specific.  Once you redeem the code it usually it can only be played on the PC where you unlocked it (unless you have a windows enabled type of tablet or mp3 player like Zune that will allow you to view it on a portable).

Then it hits you, you've been watching, ""The Son of the Revenge of the Return of The X-Men Part XXVI, The Next to the last Final Chapter."" Let's do the rundown, Good Wizards/Mutants over here, Bad Wizards/Mutants on the other side. Kindly, Good & Wise leader of the Good Wizards/Mutants is killed by the Bad Wizards/Mutants. The Bad Wizards/Mutants start a campaign against the poor Muggle's/Normal Humans. The Good Wizards/Mutants must stop this evil act. I can't go on.<br /><br />Now here is the kicker, I probably would not have noticed the similarities if this movie hadn't been so poorly made. HP & TDH is by far the worst of the series so far.  What little dialog was present in the movie was very choppy and forced. The best actor in this installment was the CG Snake. The pace of the movie went from so boring that my eyes started to bleed, (how many times do we have to do the camping thing?), to disjointed and choppy warp speed. The majority of the scenes in this movie did not flow together well at all. They were more like someone unloading a delivery truck, first scene ""bang"" on the loading dock, second scene ""bang"", stacked on top, third scene ""bang"", you get my drift? Maybe a better term would be cookie cuttered?<br /><br />Now for the DVD itself, Far too much compression. There were times that I thought that Hermione was about 7 feet tall and 125 pounds. Several of the shots of Harry's face were very distorted. The DVD was also so dark most of the time that it was very difficult to watch. On the plus side this movie did not have the huge volume swings that many modern movies have. The sound level was consistently reasonable throughout the film.<br /><br />All & all, this movie is a must see only because you must see it before part 2. The worst of the movies in the series. If you're a fan, (as I am), you will buy it for your collection but you will seldom re-watch it.<br /><br />Spence the Elder<br />""Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc""<br />-M.

However, I did wonder after seeing this movie, whether it had been a mistake to divide the last book into two parts. This is because the pace is slower than either the novel or the other six movies.  No one ever divided the other movies into two parts, however.  This made the other movies not waste a second whereas in this one the pace is a bit more leisurely.<br /><br />That being said, this otherwise brings the novel faithfully to life.  Harry, Hermione and Ron are on the run as they hunt for the horcruxes to destroy Lord Voldemort.  There is an added wrinkle they learn though when they hear the story of the Deadly Hallows from Luna's father and Hermione.  This added wrinkle is told visually with what may be puppets and is the most visually arresting part of the movie.  Whoever did this sequence did an incredible job.  It is a fabulous piece of art and storytelling.<br /><br />Lord Voldemort as played by Ralph Fienne is absolutely magnificent.  Every time he is onscreen, the story is just wonderful. The makeup and prostheses used on him also recreate the oddly disfigured creature he became when he returned to the world.<br /><br />If the second part is extremely well done, then the two parts, when viewed together, may end up being a 5 star experience.

Both will be presented in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, along with English DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround tracks. Extras will include a commentary with director Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, a second commentary with Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino and a third commentary containing Austin Premiere crowd reaction! Also included will be a 15 minute film school with the director, a Movie in High-Speed Green Screen feature, 17 uninterrupted minutes of Tarantino's segment, footage of a Sin City cast/crew party, and a 10 minute cooking school with Robert Rodriquez. Completing the package will be four featurettes on the cars, special effects make-up, costumes and props, a featurette on how they convinced Miller to assist with the film, another featurette on casting, a featurette on Tarantino the guest director, trailers, bloopers, and an interactive game. Topping it all off will be a complete Sin City graphic novel (The Hard Goodbye).<br /><br />I think this one of the best films of the year.And all fans will be waiting for the arrival of the next film.A interview that Robert Rodriguez  gave he said that the next one will be ""A Dame To Kill For"".That features Marv,Dwight,Gail and everybody else in the world of Sin City.",Sin City
5301454,B004SIPA0A, A2K4AJ2T14BWAK,5.0, The First Dead-On Translation of a Comic Source,"First of all... it's not a Tarantino movie.  He guest directed one scene... not to spoil anything, but the scene in the car with Del Toro and Clive Owen was the only part of this movie he touched.  The rest was all Rodriguez.  So don't see it based on your expectations for a Tarantino movie.  The feel of the movie is completely true to the source.  It might as well have been storyboarded right from Miller's classic.  Perfect touches of color in a film-noir black and white are both symbolic and appropriate; your attention will not be taken from what isn't important.<br /><br />The actors, too are used perfectly.  You see just enough of each megastar to understand their characters pefectly.  The director declined to overexpose them for the sake of A-List credibility.  If I wondered why a character left prematurely, sure enough, he reappeared and his part was played out.  No loose ends, no unfinished business.  Characters are avenged or killed, and no one dies without a purpose fulfilled.  Because the movie is based upon 3 separate graphic novels, it would make no sense to have all characters interacting all the time.  Only recurring characters appear in more than one story, and those characters serve the movie and the source faithfully.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar to the source, the characters are often portrayed as half-way superhuman.  It would be absolutely tragic for Marv to not be able to cleave through a dozen cops, or for Hartigan to not take bullets and keep smiling.  The most gruesome characters meet the most gruesome fates.  This is Sin City at its finest, and not one thing could have been better.",Sin City
5301455,B004SIPA0A, A2VEB9Z1W5DD4C,3.0," What ""Natural Born Killers"" tried to be","This film's over the top violence reminded me of ""Natural Born Killers"", but this film was infinitely better directed and had a much better story line.  I can certainly see how many people can love this film and find it terribly exciting.  I can likewise see how others will rate the film 1 star, based on the fact that the three interesting stories may soon be forgotten but that the graphic, horrible images may stick around for much longer.<br /><br />I don't think it can be overstated that this film is not for children.  In fact, anyone who would let someone under 12 watch this should literally be charged with child abuse.  The director appears to revel in graphic human torture; even the ""heroes"" in the story prefer torture to accomplishing a mission (or maybe torturing an adversary IS the mission).  This is the kind of film, even more than the name implies, is about the dark side of mankind.  Some will say that some characters are heroic, but even Bruce Willis brings much pain to the world by not finishing off a killer, prefering instead to torture him.  The writer really went after police and the clergy, ranking them well below prostitutes who tend to have a heart of gold.<br /><br />All that aside, the story lines are good and the film is extremely creative and well made.  Given the level of violence, I would normally turn a film like this off, but this film's creativity, storylines, and film quality keep me watching.  It was an enjoyable film, but I didn't think it was great.<br /><br />One of the attractions of the film was the all star cast.  Here's how the actors fared:<br /><br />Bruce Willis - Great job.  He IS his character. Wow. A+<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro - Also excellent.  A+ performance as expected from someone of his caliber.<br /><br />Micky Rourke - The most overated actor in Hollywood finally hits a Home Run. - A+.<br /><br />Clive Owen - Shows much more here than in ""Closer"" - A<br /><br />Jessica Alba - Although very attrative, doesn't bring more than looks to the film. B-<br /><br />Elijah Wood - I keep looking for Gandalf when he was on screen - C, but not really his fault.<br /><br />Brittany Murphy - Better than expected performance - B+<br /><br />Rosario Dawson - Miscast in her role - C<br /><br />Nick Stahl - He fits his character - A<br /><br />The others, such as Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen, and Josh Hartnett do well in their brief performances.  Devon Aoki gets noticed.<br /><br />Overall, this film is not for everyone, but if you're not too offended by wallowing in violence and discussions of raping and torturing children, you'll probably find you enjoy the film and possibly even love it.  Although there is a lot of violence, there is also a lot to like about the film.",Sin City

At first the film would appear to be one that appeals to the effect loving star-wars fan, but after watching you will be pleasantly suprised to see that it has quite an intelligent plot. What this film managed to achieve is a completely lack of the glamour which makes nearly all remakes terribly predictable, I could describe the film as a visual interpretation of a Tom Waits song.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a film that finally gives that goodie 2 shoes superhero a slap in the face, this is it.",Sin City

Now, You know the plot, so I'll just tell you about the expierence. When I first started watching this film, it was breathtaking. I got really giddy, knowing/not-knowing what is to come. The movie is so amazing, I could barley contain it all. I couldn't talk for 30 minutes after the film had ended, because i could not believe what i had seen. Some say this is violent, but it isn't. The violence is stylized and cartoony, not graphic. And, whats more shocking than the ""graphic violence"" is its moments of heavenly grace and beauty. Seeing such a desolete city, and then seeing a gorgeous angel, it is very stimulationg. But, do not get this DVD, because Sin City:Directors Cut, will be coming out in the winter (i'm not sureabout the exact date, but there will be a Sin City:Directors Cut coming up).

I rented this last night and fully expected it to suck. This was definately not the case and what I ended up with was a very good piece of cinema and great stories.<br /><br />This is Film Noir. There are no real heroes. Everything is very dark. To sum this film up in one sentence it would have to be this - The good guys are bad and the bad guys are even worse. It takes about ten minutes to get the feel of what they are trying to convey, after which you are sucked in. The plots and characters are alive and real. These are stories and if you like a gritty tale of human nature's darker side you won't be disappointed.",Sin City
5301459,B004SIPA0A, AZQ6PYDEJQJEF,4.0, What a naughty hobbit!,"I really enjoyed this movie. In fact, as far as comic book movies go, this was perfect. The script was the comic book; it followed it exactly. This is the only way Frank Miller would have had it. He's been approached for this movies several times in the past but rejected doing it simply because he wanted it to follow exactly to the comic. He didn't sell out like a lot of other comic book movies do. It's not Hollywood-ized at all. Perhaps this is why so many people just don't get this movie. If you view this movie as if you are viewing a comic book, then you get it. It is a film like no other.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez and Miller (who shared directing duties) did an amazing job with the filming. I love the way they used live actors with CGI backgrounds. The whole film (like the comic book) is black and white with touches of red and yellow. For example, in the beginning scene of the movie everything is black and white except for a woman's vibrant red dress and lips. This paints a very somber mood for the movie.<br /><br />I don't think they could have picked better actors for the roles of the characters. Everyone did a superb job. Elijah Wood was just down right creepy as a maniac who eats women and hangs their severed heads on his wall. Mickey Rourke just seemed at home on screen. He was perfect for the role and it just feels like he was the heart of Sin City; like this is where he lives. Bruce Willis is finally starting to play his age. In this he played an old cop with a heart condition. He's on the verge of retirement when he gets the biggest case of his carreer involving the senator's son. Then there is Clive Owen who plays the hard-guy who helps the prostitutes with a crocked cope played by Benicio Del Toro. Everyone just seemed to have fun playing their role and it was entertaining to watch them.<br /><br />From start to finish, this movie thrusts into momentum. There is no down time or lulls. Be forewarned though, the title is a dead giveaway for what you're in store for. There is nudity, prostitution, violence galore, cussing, killing, raping, kidnapping, eating, severing, bashing, dimembering...you name it...Sin City has it.",Sin City
5301460,B004SIPA0A, A1EB6DSPG3NETD,5.0, Visually Breathtaking And Astonishing,"Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" was one of the best comic books ever written. It has these awesome ensemble characters. Each was so interesting and each had their flaws and all of them seemed human. Even though it's obvious that the film version and the graphic novels of ""Sin City"" take place in a world that is far away from here.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez is one of the greatest directors of our time - he stands by Tarantino, Spielberg, Craven & others as collaberator of some of the greatest films that we've been pleased enough to see. He made amazing movies such as ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"", ""Desperadoes"", 2003's beautiful and bloody epic, ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"", he also makes kid's films that are actually fun to see. He made the ""Spy Kids"" trilogy and he just finished the new 3-D picture, ""Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl"". But his true jems are films like this.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is filmed in a very interesting way. It's Black & White, but various objects (eyes, blood, outfits, etc.) are in color, which makes ""Sin City"" a breathtaking pulpy noir film. If the movie was fully in color, it would still be fun, but it wouldn't look as good as it does. It's three of the graphic novels in one 2-hour film.<br /><br />The first story begins the film and ends it. John Hartigan (Bruce Willis in his best work since ""Die Hard"") plays a cop who is retiring at 60 because of heart condition. He still has one loose end to tie up. He is trying to save an 11-year-old girl named Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba as the 20-year old version. This movie is worth watching just for her, she's SO HOT!) is in the hands of a drooling child molester. And now since Hartigan is off the force and he's free to do whatever the hell he wants, he saves Nancy but is nearly beaten to death. He was framed and he is spending 8 years in prison. And when he gets out, the first thing he does is try to save a now 20-year old Nancy from a yellow rapist who can only give in if his victims scream. And Hartigan is once again out to save Nancy's back.<br /><br />The 2nd story revolves around the character of Mickey Rourke. He plays Marv - a guy who is in love with a prostitute named Goldie. When he is sleeping, a cannibal (Elijah Wood in a thoroughly disturbing role). It's his job to save himself and Goldie's twin sister Wendy (both ladies played by Nicole Kidman lookalike Jamie King). The bloody results are anything but pretty.<br /><br />The last story revolves around Dwight (a very good Clive Owen) is trying to save everybody from a dirty cop with a penchant for violence (Benecio DelToro in a very enthusiastic part), he plays the ultimate bad guy and he gets his comeuppance. Dwight tries to save the girls of ""Old Town""( a city that is overrun by [...]). He takes place in a bloody war that includes Rosario Dawson, Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel and other recognizable people.<br /><br />In conclusion, ""Sin City"" is easily the coolest movie of the year and it provides great surprises and thrills the whole way through. You shouldn't buy this DVD though. Rent it a few times, because director Robert Rodriguez has something special planned for fans that plan to wait for what is yet to come. There will be a 2-disc special edition that will include new footage and much more. This DVD has only a lousy 8-minute behind-the-scenes featurette. I bought it for about $10 somewhere, but I will be the first one there when the Special Edition hits the shelves. Get SIN CITY immediately.",Sin City

It was in black and white which we didn't like but you get use to it after a while. The movie was actually a bunch of little movies that came together in the end. There are also a lot of really vilent parts so its not really a kids movie (the theater we went to doesn't even check your age!). anyways, it was really good and you should see it :) ~*~ Jennifer Beekman ~*~",Sin City

I guess it takes a graphic novelist like Frank Miller and a true movie visionary like Roberto Rodriguez to pull off the most intense and entertaining film noir of the 21st century thus far. Kudos to both, and may the collaboration continue!",Sin City

It's very artistic, with a lot of plot and story. There are 4 stories in this movie, and a few of them intersect. Anyone who is faint of heart should not watch this movie.",Sin City
5301464,B004SIPA0A, ACPDNSQGO8IFG,4.0, Good fantasy movie,"This is basically film noir exaggerated beyond reason - a film that is black and white in it's characters as much as it is literally black and white. I call it fantasy because it is unapologetically unrealistic - it does not pretend to represent reality in any way, shape or form, and in doing so, it is free to create a world of its own, true to its own consistent logic which has nothing to do with the logic of the real world. The movie is not deep in the least, is very violent, and is HORRIBLY misogynistic - the most misogynistic movie I have ever seen, but it is also unlike anything else I have seen - a dream perhaps, a film noir stripped to it's bare bones and then exaggerated a thousand-fold, Mickey Spillane on steroids. Recomended for guys, expecially movie ""geeks"".",Sin City

I missed the theatrical release, but had heard good things about it. So, I was patiently waiting to see this movie. WOW! This movie was amazing. This is one of the most exciting, intense, and beautifully shot movies I have ever seen. I was absolutely rivetted. The characters and story are wonderfully brilliant. Not to mention the way they shot it.

This film delivers on the promise that director Robert Rodriguez suggested in previous endeavors.  Though assisted by Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino I was trying to spot the efforts from these contributors, particularly Tarantino, but was hard pressed.  If this was a case where the stunning visuals surpassed the story then this film would be easy to dismiss but that's not the case here.  The story here is primary and the three connecting vignettes flow smoothly.  The acting here is also not overwhelmed by the visuals.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke both give their best performances in years and Clive Owen's star continues to rise.  The women here  offer strong performances here in particularly Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino.  The real find here is newcomer Devon Aoki as the lethal Meho.  This film may not be to everybody's taste but it cannot be faulted for lack of originality.",Sin City

Nancy thanks him and writes under an alias but after eight years the letters stop and he fears she was found. confessing to everything he tracks down and finds she is now a stripper at a club and realizes...he was set up. now he must protect Nancy from the same lunatic who tried to kill her. i recomand this to any one because it is a great movie, great cast, and is set in the great times of black and white.",Sin City

It's visually stunning and fun to watch. The characters are larger then life and fun to follow throughout the movie. This movie is Rodriquez's Pulp Fiction. Using Frank Miller's character's and story, he creates a movie you can watch over and over again. Mickey Rourke is perfect and is without a doubt the best character in the film.

The sets, the characters, and the CGI were all outstanding.  Sin City grabs you from the initial scene and drags you into a world of crime, corruption, and prostitution, and by the time its over you have to shake to remind yourself that you're back in the real world.<br /><br />Almost the entire film is in deep, dark black and piercingly bright white, you really feel like you're in a comic book.  The occasional color is only used for emphasis (kind of like Snoop Dogg's ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" video), and it works, on so many different levels.  While a little confusing at times, this movie reminds me a little of the Max Payne Video Game series, with the constant narration and graphic violence.  I recommend this film to anyone who likes comic books, graphic violence, or just wants to see a great story and interesting characters.",Sin City

No other movie that I can think of has looked this way.<br /><br />The movie is made for the comic book crowd, and stays true to form.<br /><br />Some of the blood and guts got to me alittle, and I had to shut my eyes.

Though Sin city does tend to exeel these movies by one point. The acting. Mikey Rouke steals the show as Marv, the hulkish  thug whose main purpose is to find the killers of the love of his life, and give them some street justice. His story is compelling and very, very, violent. Well I take that back the most violent story would have to be Bruce Willis who plays Hartigan , a violent ex cop who wants to protect a stripper from his past misadventure that has her also involved, in this story line you actually see a mans testicles ripped off............actually that was...........god .........burr. Anyway overall all the stories are downright violent. There is one more but I would not want to intrude like I did before..<br /><br />Now as for dvd news Rodrigues is giving out a threatical release and an extended release.<br /><br />Also he will bring in more Sin city movies from now on, and will be planning to release a new one 2008 or 9, so get ready.<br /><br />Yours trully<br /><br />film critique of the week.",Sin City

It's a free country and if you don't condone violent movies, then simply don't go - period.  Jamie King is drop dead gorgeous, as is Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy.<br /><br />Benecio Del Toro proves to be the best among the male cast as the mercurial Jackie Boy, although Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis (and surprisingly Elijah Wood) more than hold their own as well.",Sin City

Unfortunately, in each case the woman is someone who they either don't know at all or have only just met - so as motivation this is totally unbelievable.<br /><br />Frank Miller's Dark Night Returns had a lot more depth than this.  Perhaps Miller is running thin on ideas and is repeating himself.  If the two planned Sin City movie sequels are made, perhaps he will redeem himself with a broader range of character types with more depth and believability.",Sin City

5301477,B004SIPA0A, ABEQ1E9NDNOAY,4.0, Different and Fun.  Sin city is a well produced movie,"Not everyone will like Sin City, but if you grew up reading Frank Miller comic books you might.  Or, if you are looking for something different to watch.  Sin City's landscape and cinematic appearance is well done.  It's kind of a cross between a black and white comic book and real actors...no not Roger Rabbit!  What really makes this movie great are the emotions and personalities of the characters.  You have really seedy bad guys and people that are in bad situtations who are at the end of their wit and have to do everything they can to survive.  I wished it had been a little longer but oh well.  I hope they make another one.",Sin City
5301478,B004SIPA0A, A37PV5GMP2ILJC,4.0," A ""3 in 1"" festival of violence","To understand and appreciate this movie you'll need a little background information.  First of all, it's not one story, but a combination of three stories from the graphic novels of the same name, with a short clip from another story as an introduction.<br /><br />The introductory skit, starring Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, is from ""The Customer is Always Right"", the others being ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""That Yellow Bastard"".<br /><br />Shot in a way that is as close to the original comics as possible, the movie is in black and white, except for certain highlighted objects in the frames that are vividly colored in stark contrast.  Without significant amounts of nudity, it earns its rating because of the violence which is central to the plots, and boy, does that white blood flow and fly.<br /><br />The movie smells of Tarantino, but he only directs one small, and of course totally weird, bit, the majority being done by Robert Rodriguez, and Frank Miller, author of the novels.<br /><br />Each segment is illuminated by star power such as Jessica Alba (Nancy), Rosario Dawson (great as Gail), Benicio Del Toro (outstanding as Jackie Boy), Michael Clark Duncan (Manute), Carla Gugino (Lucille), Rutger Hauer (Cardinal Roark), Jaime King (Goldie/Wendy), Michael Madsen (brilliant as Bob), Brittany Murphy (Shellie), Clive Owen (Dwight), Mickey Rourke (brilliant as Marv), Elijah Wood (creepy as Kevin) and not forgetting Bruce Willis (Hartigan), in one of his best performances ever.  I also liked Devon Aoki as ""Miho"" whose role brought back memories of Kill Bill and the Crazy 88.<br /><br />Without knowing the source, the movie would be a bit confusing, as characters can be seen appearing in all three stories, and after a while, some of the female stars start looking alike.  There's nothing light about this movie, and it may not be for everybody, but the action keeps coming and the blood keeps pumping, and it's hard to look away.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, September 24, 2005",Sin City
5301479,B004SIPA0A, A1PHQ9P3Y07QKP,4.0, New and different,"When I first saw that commercial for this film I wanted to see it more than any film ever. The Crow is my favorite comic and movie, so I was not afraid of the gore or violence, although it must be said that I hate Tarentino. I could barley sit through Kill Bill, and I vowed never to see another one of his films again.<br /><br />But the visuals! I wished ""The Crow"" could have been done like this! When Sin City came out I read a review that said the plot sucked and the acting was horrible and every woman was a whore. I said I wouldn't go to it in the theater.<br /><br />I watched it last night, and it was amazing. Some people only want to watch a film that is going to take them out of their lives - or make them feel better about them. Make no mistake, that is not the point of sin city. this movie is set in it's own world, in it's own time. I loved the plots, but I love revenge. One review said that the gore and killings seemed pointless at times. I did not find this to be true at all. Ever death in this movie served a purpose.<br /><br />The acting was awesome, which is something because I can't imagine how hard it must have been. I would have to say my favorite part of the film is when Jessica Alba jumps off the bar and kisses Bruce Willis, my heart lifted and I smiled. Love - in the midst of all that is evil and horrifying - was beautiful and believeable.<br /><br />I'm 24, and a woman. And I loved this movie.",Sin City

Frank Miller's gritty tale of Sin City is summed up for us in this masterpiece with excellent visual effects, damn sexy women, and some of some hard-as-nails men narrating the stories. Even if the story was crap, it's visually stunning. Turns out though, it's fantastic.<br /><br />Recommended if you like Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, etc.",Sin City

But's it's not to be missed by anyone who appreciates a good and strange flick.<br /><br />Almost entirely CGI, it's actually beautiful and extremely well crafted. It's like one of those movies that looks like a cartoon, but with real actors. I can't get over the detail given to certain scenes. Someone really loved it into a movie.",Sin City
5301482,B004SIPA0A, AQI2CW6UKF1ES,5.0, Prove you're still worth a d@mn,"I never ever read of or herd of Sin City, until I saw the comercial.  My friend tho', he wouldn't stop whinning about how much this movie was gonna suck because the men who directed Once upon a time in mexico, and Kill Bill were gonna screw it up, and that Frank Miller was nuts even considering to work with them.  But when the movie shut him up, he wouldn't shut up about, you gotta see this movie.  So I checked it out.<br /><br />Hartigan(Bruce Willis), a man sworn to protect the law, and a little girl, Marv(Mickey Rourke), a man who want's the one responsible for his only true love, and Dwight(Clive Owen)a man who has a reason for going to Old Town, are all the 3 main focuses on Sin City.  When things go wrong for the situations that happened for these 3 guys, they a;ways have that matality to prove that they're still worth a d@mn, but will it be enough to get them out of the situations they are deeply into?<br /><br />I love the movie's feel for bringing the comic book to life.  I only saw pages of the comic on the movie, but it just feels so much like a comic book.  I mean, this is nearly true comic brought to life.  The black and white CGI fast paced cartoon feel is definitly a upside to this film.  It also contains comic humor, like Jackie Boy's(Benicio Del Toro) slow yet utterly rediculas death, when Marv dragged a guy on the street by his car while driving, and Miho(Devon Aoki) throwing a shrukien that looks like something that will upset a certain group of people.  And the cool dialouge is also another factor that makes it stylish, and my personal favorite cones from Marv:""The hell I send him too must seem like heaven after I'm through with him.""<br /><br />Sin City is definitly a comic book brought to life.  My whining friend instantly fell in love with it.  He ownes all covers, and s trying to grab every poster made.  Me, I'm just glad I got the oppertunity to see such a fine crime-drama action comic style movie like this, and have enough money at the time to buy it.  I like this more than Spider-Man 2, The Crow, but it's hard to choose between this and Batman Begins.  But anyone interested in the Crime/Drama action or Frank Miller's Graphic Novels should definitly check this out.

As you know, the movie Sin City was created from three of Frank Miller's Sin City books, ""The Hard Goodbye"", ""The Big Fat Kill"", and ""That Yellow Bastard"".  Rodriguez shot these stories in their entirity and spliced them together for the theatrical version of the film.  In the upcoming Special Edition of the DVD, these three stories will be recut separatly and include footage that was cut for release.  The DVD will also include the theatrical version, and the next installment in Rodriguez's ""10 Minute Film School"" series.  My advice is to save your money and get the real Sin City DVD when it is released this Winter.",Sin City
5301487,B004SIPA0A, AJ4CR2LM73UCK,5.0," ""Then it hit me like a kick in the nuts.""","Marv could not describe this film any better.  Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have officially indocrinated 21st Century Film Noir with ""Sin City.""  Color blind, brutal, and simply brilliant.  The biggest, nastiest, and most faithful comic-book film brought to stark, gritty life might also happen to be one of this year's best films.<br /><br />The most soulful story goes to ""The Hard Goodbye"", with Mickey Rourke giving a career-defining performance as Marv.  One magical night with a goddess that ends in death sends him on a relentless quest for revenge on a nimble cannibal (Elijah Wood) and his puppet master (Rutger Hauer).  Every answer, every clue comes to Marv the hard way, and he behaves accordingly.  But even though an angel will run him down with her car three times and pistol-whip him into a near concussion, he still doesn't hurt girls.  The best noirs feature evil protagonists not afraid to die; but Marv will kill, die, AND go to Hell for Goldie on his warpath.  Amen.<br /><br />In ""Sin City"" men are animals, and women the fodder for them.  Benicio del Toro's malevolent turn as bad-cop Jackie Boy owns the story of Dwight (Clive Owen) and his rekindled romance with a merciless whore, when a truce between them and the cops gets violently broken.  The only way to keep the secret (Jackie Boy's severed head) is to invoke massacre upon Irish terrorists in love with explosives and a cyclops kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan) who wish to expose the betrayal to the whole city.  But The Girls of Old Town can't let that happen.<br /><br />""That Yellow Bastard"" is the bookending story: introducing the film and closing it.  An aging detective (Bruce Willis) with angina rescues a potential rape victim, gets double-crossed by his partner, then framed for the crime.  The culprit is the son of a Senator (Powers Boothe) with an unholy fondness for little girls put under duress.  As the framed cop sits in prison for years, the slimy sex-maniac gets treated with experimental regeneration medicine to replace the right hand, left ear, and package that was so violently taken from him.  The result is a pear-shaped, remorphed yellow monster hellbent on exacting revenge.  An inside-out physical likeness of the kid's twisted soul.  Jessica Alba (as Nancy Callahan) is delicious but not intense enough to respectfully enunciate the horror I myself had tasted upon first reading that scene in the comic.  Obviously, Bruce Willis takes the reigns in this tale.<br /><br />I've heard people say the film is too gratuitous, and I'm prone not to argue.  It is.  But the only reason it is, is because the graphic novels are, too.  ""Sin City"" is basically a madmen's cinematic experiment gone horribly right.  It's flat-out mean, sadistic, and misogynist -- just like all the best film noirs.  If you asked this film to apologize for being what it was, it would respond with a bullet.  However, it is beautifully realized.  Who knew that a premier artist and a superior technician could create a ""City"" that... breathes its own denizens.<br /><br />You can taste this film between your teeth.",Sin City
5301488,B004SIPA0A, A13E0ARAXI6KJW,4.0, High POW Factor for Audacious Thrill Ride Into Sin City,"A visually audacious movie and an unpredictably wild ride into palookaville, this is one unique film viewing experience. I am not familiar with Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novels, but my guess is that Miller, who shares a co-director credit with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, has remained faithful in capturing the hard-boiled, crime-infested world of Basin City and its cynical inhabitants.  It takes a visual cue from last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" by green-screening the backdrops and using digitally-produced images as the landscape, but that's where the similarity ends. Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and white ""Schindler's List""). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as ""Special Guest Director"" though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis' ""Death Becomes Her"" (which coincidentally also starred Bruce Willis).<br /><br />The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esque Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's ""9 1/2 Weeks"", Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall,  a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona)  and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character. The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career before ""Traffic"". Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch.<br /><br />Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer. All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over its two-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow.  But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride.",Sin City
5301489,B004SIPA0A, A3PPXVR5J6U2JD,5.0, Frodo Gone Bad,"I became a fan of Frank Miller's work the day I opened the pages of ""The Dark Knight Returns.""  Miller took the comic world by storm with his writing style.  His characters narrated panels instead of using thought bubbles. They were old, tired adults, not perky superheroes.  In Miller's hands, Batman became a weary war veteran desperately looking for a way to end his career without killing himself, Commissioner Gordon worried about his wife, and bad guys were Neo-Nazi naked monstrosities, all teeth and fangs.  It was a turning point for comics, transforming them into entertainment for adults, and the medium has never looked back since.  It was a turning point for my own writing as well; my stories from that point on took on a completely different feel, all inspired by Miller.<br /><br />Sin City is what happens when Miller is free to do what he wants.  He's a film noir fan at heart and Sin City is every bit an anachronistic blend of comic book action and pulpy dialogue. Fan of film noir will find all the iconic characters in Sin City: the weary integrity of a private eye, the pathos of a gangster past his prime, the desperation of a man wrongly accused of murder, the rage of a psychopath, and of course the femme fatale.<br /><br />Film noir is also about narration.  We hear the characters' thoughts and understand just how desperate and lonely they are.  By knowing our protagonists' minds, we can appreciate their paranoia and hopelessness.  And in film noir, the world is out to get everybody.  There are no good guys; indeed, often the authority figures that would be considered ""good"" (police officers, priests) are evil and the people deemed least ethical (prostitutes, murderers) are the heroes. Ultimately, whatever innocence any of the characters has is lost.  Sin City (short for Basin City, the very bottom of civilization) covers the entire spectrum.<br /><br />Sin City is actually three mini-movies combined, all taking place at approximately the same time.  The plots are from the graphic novels: The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, and The Big Fat Kill, with the short story threads The Customer is Always Right and Babe Wore Red thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The first and last scenes of the movie perfectly capture the tone of film noir: a beautiful girl and a mysterious dark-haired man meet somewhere.  We don't know the circumstances that brought them together but can feel the tension between them.  They act like lovers even though they've only just met.  But it can only end in blood.<br /><br />In The Hard Goodbye thread, Marv (Mickey Rourke), a giant monster of a man sleeps with the woman of his dreams, Goldie (Jaime King).  He awakens only to find her dead.  Marv's not good for much, but he's good at killing, so he gets revenge the only way he knows how: by punching people until they squeal. Eventually, Marv discovers a serial killer who has a taste for ladies of the night.  When the two finally meet, we learn that Marv can be just as depraved when he's out for revenge.<br /><br />No, seriously, it's probably one of the grossest things I've seen in movies in awhile.<br /><br />In The Big Fat Kill, Dwight (Clive Owen) is the new boyfriend of strip club waitress Shelley (Brittany Murphy).  Unfortunately, Shelley has an old boyfriend named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro), a bad guy who likes to beat up women.  Dwight is determined to stop Jackie Boy from killing anyone else, only to trail him to Dwight's own ex-girlfriend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her Old Towne Girls.  The Old Towne Girls are prostitutes who run their own part of town.  There are no pimps, no dirty cops, and no mob.  Indeed, their part of town almost seems like some kind of nirvana for ladies of the night.  And of course, they all dress in extremely kinky outfits when they're not brandishing katanas, wicked-looking knives, throwing stars shaped like swastikas, or Uzis.  But Jackie Boy isn't who he seems and it's up to Dwight, Gail, and Miho (Devon Aoki) to keep a head (yes, I said HEAD) safe before a turf war explodes onto the streets.<br /><br />In That Yellow Bastard, another serial rapist (Rourk Jr., played by Nick Stahl) and son of a senator (Powers Boothe) is the one remaining loose end that good cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis) can't put behind him.  On his last day of retirement, Hartigan decides to go after the untouchable Rourk Jr. and save Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), only to end up in prison for eight years for a crime he didn't commit.  We catch up with Hartigan later in the movie when he gets out of prison and discovers that the more things change, the more they remain the same.<br /><br />Except for Nancy, who in eight years grows up to be a major hottie, an attribute not unnoticed by poor, tortured Hartigan.<br /><br />There are too many villains to list here, but they are all memorable even in their few moments of screen time.  Three notable examples are the hilarious muttering of a lackey with an arrow sticking out of his chest, the elucidating thug who pronounces his every thought out loud Chandler Bing-style, and the hired mercenary who moved from bullets to explosives because, ""you just can't go back to shooting people when you've seen a pub blow up and all the parts fly out.""<br /><br />By staying true to the original characters, the director (Robert Rodriguez) creates an entirely new film genre.  It makes better use of digital effects first showcased in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, and yet never forgets its comic roots.  The action pedigree is most evident in Marv, an unstoppable juggernaut who smashes through doors, bounces off of speeding cars, and rips people apart with his bare hands...a few bandages and pills later and he's fine.  Good guys and bad guys alike get shot so full of lead that they should be pencils, only to recover in the next scene. The men are all really nasty lugs and the women are all gorgeous and toned.<br /><br />The movie is filmed in all black and white, with splashes of color for good measure.  This achieves two amazing effects: it nails the feel of film noir and draws the viewer's eyes to important things about characters that might otherwise be missed.  For example, Dwight wears red sneakers, symbolic of having at least one foot dipped in blood from his murderous past.  The use of color, especially Yellow Bastard's...well, yellowishness, makes the character all the more disgusting. Color, when it appears, is as much a character as any actor on screen.<br /><br />The actors are suitably restrained.  If Sin City has a flaw, it's that it's too true to its roots at times, which might alienate modern audiences. Some of the characters have eye-rolling dialogue, but then, that's part of the mood of Sin City.  It's not meant to be realistic or even hip.  Sin City is true to itself, and it's up to the audience if they want to go along for the ride.<br /><br />This is the same kind of uncompromising vision that Peter Jackson brought to the screen with Lord of the Rings.  By deeply respecting the original creator's work, he shattered the preconceived notions of what a movie should be and conjures something we've never seen before.  I was skeptical about a comic book, even Miller's books, being turned into a new format, but Rodriguez did it and he did it with style.<br /><br />Sin City is dark, violent, and even sadistic at times. But most importantly, it has Frodo (Elijah Wood) as a hopping cannibal.  After seeing this film, I will never think of him as a cuddly little hobbit again.",Sin City
5301490,B004SIPA0A, A2460ZRFVC2YGV,5.0, Unadulterated Brilliance,"I knew from the preview that ""Sin City"" was worth looking into, as I am a huge fan of noir. Yet, there was something about the preview that suggested that the noirish atmosphere might be gimmickery. Maybe just the preview was noirish. Heck, parts of it suggested that it might be an animated feature. There's nothing wrong with that, I would just feel as though my expectations were messed with. My fears grew larger when the television preview made the ""Frank Miller"" at the top more obvious. ""Who's he?"" I asked myself. ""Oh no! could this guy be the director, are they trying to fool us into believing this is a Robert Rodriguez film when he's actually just producing?"" I'd almost fallen for that publicity trick before, and if that was what ""they"" were doing I wasn't going to be happy. If any of you had those doubts as well you can relax. It IS a Rodriguez film along with several ""guest directors"" including Quentin Tarantino. I wasn't able to ascertain who did what as the interlocking stories are not clearly deleneated ""episodes"". The atmosphere is wonderful, and I am a harsh judge when it comes to neo-noir. It was MUCH more violent than I was initially prepared for but that's my own fault. I QUICKLY got into Rodriguez/Tarantino mode. It just caught me off guard. Go see it NOW. I've never seen anything like it. The use of color is spare, expressive and stylish. I'm glad I went with my gut reaction and gave it the chance I knew it deserved.",Sin City
5301491,B004SIPA0A, A29Y34ALWJUGB5,4.0, The Special Edition Sin City,"I found this a very difficult movie to rate. I wanted so badly to give it a five because of the movie itself, but I also wanted to give the Unrated edition a three for the package, as it is very disappointing. So, I settled on a solid four. Here's why.<br /><br />Firstly, Sin City as a movie alone was excellent. It was innovative and almost as good as my absolute favorite movie Pulp Fiction, and this I believe is because the two are so much alike. Sin City doesn't even try to explain itself. The characters ramble on in moments of deep thought, revealing what makes them tick. It's filled to the brim with Arnold-esque one-liners. The surreal style of this film makes all the characters seem like super heroes of sorts (not strange, considering Frank Miller, the god of American comics, created this series). In fact, everything that happens in this movie would make other movies bad. Who wants to listen to the thoughts of a character, something that's usually left in books? Yet in Sin City it words. Who still likes Arnold one-liners, what with all those Arnold impressions going on anymore? Obviously, Frank Miller, and so do his fans. Who wants surrealism in their movies? Anyone who likes super hero movies, which record tells a lot of people. All this comes together to make Sin City the all-time greatest comic-book movie.<br /><br />Now, for the Sin City Uncut edition, the only true bonus here is the graphic novel, which I have yet to read myself (review coming later). It gives you the chance to see just how innovative the movie Sin City is, and how true the directors wanted to keep the movie to the book. After that, there is little to keep my interest. Some of the special features found here should have been included in the first edition of Sin City, which I foolishly wasted my money on not knowing this edition was coming. Plus, unless you watch both versions of the movie back to back, you'll never be able to tell which scenes were added. The breakdown of stories so that you can watch them singularly doesn't add anything. It's jarring, actually, since it breaks the rhythm the original version followed.<br /><br />In the end, I can't recommend this movie to anyone who has the original version. If you don't have that version, however, pick this up quick. It is still a superior version, only not by much.",Sin City
5301492,B004SIPA0A, A3C6CZC2JP67VK,4.0, Unforgettable..............,"Once my husband and I purchased this movie, I didn't know what to expect. All I knew about it that it was unique, due to all the hype. I have to admit that it was pretty good no lie. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. This trio made a gritty masterpiece of this underground comic book hit! They have perfected stylist zed violence; they have sniggered and winked and done the secret handshake about guns, and knives, and beating each other to a pulp, and rape, and how all of this adds up to some masculine heroic ideal.<br /><br /> I mean if you've seen the trailers in the past you knew that something new and excitingly was coming. And once you've seen the movie, it is amazingly hard to get the film noir images out of your head. The cast list is incredible: from Josh Hartnett in the opening sequence to Bruce Willis's exposition of the back story, to Mickey Rourke as ""Marv"", then to the smoking hot Clive Owen as ""Dwight"", this is a man's movie. Testosterone and adolescent male fantasies drive this convoluted tale of urban corruption. In fact, experiencing this movie is a bit like being inside the adolescent male mind in a dream-like state.<br /><br />I'm naturally bothered by the obvious male fantasy that all women (in the movie, of course) are hookers or strippers, all at least half-naked or wearing thongs and fishnet stockings. ""All women"", except for an eleven-year old girl-- almost a rape victim--, who grows up to be Jessica Alba the stripper. Most are victims, and even Rosario Dawson, playing strong-- even dominatrix, has to wait for Clive Owen to show up to rescue her. This is one movie that makes me almost thankful for ""political correctness"" outside the theater. Beside that visually and cinematographically the movie is genius you must own this DVD.",Sin City
5301493,B004SIPA0A, A1IBSQQHGCDUAN,5.0, Noir reinvented,"If there's anything you knew in advance about ""Sin City"" (aside from who gets naked -- show a little class dammit) it's that director Robert Rodriquez went as far out of his way as humanly possible to make this film adhere as closely as possible to the visual feel of the comic book source material. Well, I haven't read any of Frank Miller's legendary ""Sin City"" comics, but having seen the movie, I can't imagine it existing without them.Many people will see similarities between ""Sin City"" and the work of Quentin Tarantino, both because Robert Rodriquez will probably never break free from this stigma no matter how many kiddie flicks he makes, and more importantly -- gulp -- he actually inviteds QT on board to direct one of the segments, this after he'd torn up his DGA membership card in disgust after they wouldn't allow him to list Frank Miller as a co-director, so as far as integrity goes it's hard to one-up Sir Robert here. I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to which segment QT was supposed to be directing ahead of viewing this flick, and it's to the film's credit that it all seems of a piece no matter how the chores were divvied up.<br /><br />Now, there are a couple of things that are immediately going to weed out a certain part of the older audience (hello Ma!), this being the ""artsy"" use of black-and-white splashed here and there with purposeful primary colors, and also the integrity of the action sequences. I shouldn't diss the so-called ""older"" audience, being in my third decade of existence myself, but my parents and everyone else their age have certain prejudices toward a particular kind of modern film, this being the type that has ""far fetched"" action sequences. Yes, in ""Sin City"" the characters are able to take a ridiculous amount of bullets and keep on ticking as well as jumping out of windows several stories to the ground without any apparent injuries, but to that I say that there is a reason this kind of thing works in a film like ""Sin City"" whereas it can easily wear thin in a movie like, say, ""The Matrix"". Sin City is portrayed as a hopelessly fatalistic backdrop against which the best the characters can hope for is to die with a little bit of dignity. It doesn't really matter that Marv doesn't croak after taking a bullet to the head because you know the dice are gonna roll cold for him sooner or later.Another comparison people may make to Tarantino is to point out that ""Sin City"" is also an anthology film. I could mention the fact that this is based on three graphic novels featuring different protagonists and leave it at that, but -- at the risk of unduly diminishing the genius of Quentin Tarantino, whose ""Pulp Fiction"" is undeniably the most influential film of the 90s and a work of art in it's own right -- it should be noted that QT did not, in fact, actually INVENT the anthology film. No, that would be George Romero and Stephen King with ""Creepshow"" (I'm kidding, of course, but you get my point...).<br /><br />Aside from the anthology aspect, there is one thing that actually does somewhat resemble ""Pulp Fiction"": Bruce Willis' character makes an early exit only to return later in the film. It's not the same chronological gimmick that QT utilized but I've said enough as it is.The one aspect that got so much press in the film's pre-release was the unprecedented decision to film the entire movie in front of a green screen. This move not only doesn't come off as a gimmick but you'll find yourself forgetting that ""Sin City"" isn't absolutely real about five minutes into the movie. Sure, there are numerous improbabilities, as detailed above, but it's the MOVEMENT of the characters, vehicles, weapons, etc. that seem a bit cartoonish; nothing about the actual scenery really does. In essence, ""Sin City"" sticks to the elements that continue to make noir so compelling: great camerawork, gritty characterizations, and the theme of a hardened soul holding out some kind of remote hope for redemption. Bruce Willis was an absolute no-brainer for this flick: he's spent the last decade perfecting this world-weary gutter saint character, and ""Sin City"" is arguably his best portrait of this tortured soul archetype yet. Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke are the three main protagonists, and you'll find yourself rooting for them not through point-of-view bias alone, but because each of these guys completely earns the right to be called a bad ass. In a way I'm glad they saved the fate of Willis' character for last as the whole movie seems to be building to such tragedy.<br /><br />So, yes, it's unfortunate that so many people will rent this movie sheerly on the recommendation of Mr. Skin, but hopefully ""Sin City"" will turn more than a few heads on to a new, hightened quality of experimental film-making in the same way that the aforementioned ""Pulp Fiction"" did a decade ago. Word is that Rodriquez is planning two back-to-back sequels as we speak.",Sin City
5301494,B004SIPA0A, A2F1P10GGZ7K2T,2.0, you'll either love it or hate it,"If you are a comic/graphic novel fan then this story is one of the most talked about over the years and you'll appreciate the creativity of the makers in brining this gritty story to the screen. For the simple fact that it is based on a ""comic"", many will love it regardless of the content.<br /><br />For those that aren't fans of comics I'd wager that there will be a greater chance of not not liking this at all for the simple fact that it is based on a comic and it is shown with a constant meld of animation and live action which may turn many off.<br /><br />My initial feelings of this movie are like those of Pulp Fiction. . .a linking of short stories that left the viewers torn between one camp who loved it and one who hated it.<br /><br />As with Pulp Fiction I'm one of the few who is in the middle ground.<br /><br />1) The movie is beautiful and creative. The black & white animation melded with live action and the single splashes of color were eye catching<br /><br />2) WARNING: If you are offended by EXTREME graphic violence and some nudity then this movie is not for you and some parents may consider watching it before letting their teenagers view it due the trademark Tarantino adult content. Unlike Kill Bill where the violence was just a joke that it moved from gross to ignoring it, this was plain violent for shock value I thought.<br /><br />3) The best part of the movie is Marv! Nuff said.<br /><br />4) If you favor one contiguous story with one main protagonist and one main antagonist then you might not like this. Like I said, this is a handful of short stories that are linked by Sin City as the setting<br /><br />5) If you like ""happy"" endings then you might not appreciate on some levels the story resolutions that take place. This is not a happy movie but one where courage and purpose in life can show up even in the most desperate and dark places.<br /><br />Overall, it was an intriguing movie to watch though I felt dirty afterwards on different levels. In Tarantino's fashion he always exploits the dark side of people with a glimmer of heroism thrown in. Simply because it is ""new"" is not a good reason to watch something. . .this is one I'd lean more in the end to wishing I had not exposed myself to.",Sin City
5301495,B004SIPA0A, A3OVG2AHZRGA55,4.0, A Nice Suprise - 4.5 Stars,"Being familiar with Rodiriguez's past films, from El Mariachi to Spykids to that The Faculty, I approached Sin City with a certain sense of expectation; this is not a director particularly interested in story and character. He tells a damn good, visceral action tale and blows things up with startling aplomb, but that's about it. I was expecting nothing more from Sin City than an entertaining action film, and what I got was much more than that.<br /><br />Sure it's all adolescent male fantasy with large-breasted women in bondage clothes and badass dudes with big guns and hard attitudes, but in a way it's a look out our society devoid of pretense; men are manly and immoral or not worth a damn to the general public, women are essentially in bondage and, despite notions of female empowerment, still basically subservient to the whimsy of the great phallus that rules over us all. Granted, this is probably reading too much into the film, but I doubt someone with the intelligence of Frank Miller would over look this.<br /><br />The stories of the film, which I will spare you of, as no doubt everyone else on this site has written it out in great detail, are all very engrossing and told with Rodriguez's prodigious sense pacing and intensity. What really puts the film over the edge for me, and makes it one step beyond traditional action fare, is the sense of morality and the deeply nuanced characters, all brought to life well by the respective actors, standouts being Del Toro, Owen, Dawson, Rourke and the unfortunately underused Michael Clark Duncan and Brittany Murphy.<br /><br />And then there are the visuals: Rodriguez and Miller, working directly from the latter's source material, have created an amazing, multi-faceted and entirely original world on screen. There are some who might call this stylistic choice a concession of the medium, and others who would hail it as brilliant; I would simply say it's inspired. Unlike others films that have employed similar techniques, from Star Wars to Sky Captain, it is never distracting. Never do Rodriguez and Miller let the style take away from the substance, a very admirable feat.<br /><br />Could I write a review of this film without addressing the issue of violence? While this film is ultra violent, if you care to viddy, from start to finish, it's not really a violent film; it's all very cartoonist, and the style of the movie, with it's green screen scenery and lack of color, doesn't really allow the film to be oppressively violent. While some of the content-child molestation, rape, prostitution, drugs, etc. . .-is disturbing and horrifying, I would say that on a whole this film is not quite on par with Fight Club, Apocalypse Now, or Irreversible as far as actual, gruesome, psychological violence ins concerned. It just isn't realistic or believable enough.<br /><br />So all this praise, but why not five stars? Well, I'm judging this film on a scale not indigenous to Amazon, and so I won't quite give it classic status. While it is an entertaining, intense, and emotional involving film, it is lacking a certain something that would put in on par with films such as Pulp Fiction, Seven, and Taxi Driver in the annals of insane, violent, grotesque, pulpy Americana. Perhaps it is the comic books style, the lack of character development of back story (particularly in the case of Murphy, Owens's, and Dawson's characters-an extra 20 minutes could have easily remedied this problem)or perhaps it just requires another viewing, but Sin City does not haunt the viewer, does not stay with and torment you with it's dystopian visions; you leave the theater, and it's gone into the night nearly as quickly as it's come.<br /><br />Sin City, unlike Rodriguez's previous films, is one of gravitas. It carrier and emotional depth, a sense of morality, and a vision of its characters that has been crafted with great care by a master hand. The film is like a fractal-it is smooth until you get very close, at which point it becomes and infinitely unfolding canvas of smaller and smaller recesses. More than anything, this is a film that is striking in the obvious maturity and command of craft of its directors. Sin City proves that there is more to Rodriquez than met then eye.",Sin City
5301496,B004SIPA0A, A146D2LYLICNLS,4.0," Skinny little Nancy Callahan. She grew up, she filled out...","...oh, DID SHE EVER. Truer words have never been spoken. It should be illegal to have curves like that. Someday I will make Jessica Alba mine. Ok, I had to get that off my chest.<br /><br />I'll first say that I have never read a ""Sin City"" book. I've certainly heard of it, but it has never appealed to me (no disrespect to any long-time fans). But I heard enough about this movie to become interested, especially because of the visuals. After seeing it yesterday, I can safely say that one does NOT have to be familiar with the books in order to like this film. I found myself fascinated throughout the whole movie by the excellent visuals, as I was when watching ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" although it has to be said that ""Sky Captain"" was mainly for the kiddies in terms of the level of violence, whereas ""Sin City"" is a far cry from being kid-friendly.<br /><br />Which brings me to the violence in this film. Yes, it is brutal and graphic. However, there are two things which keep the violence level below the in-your-face, sick-to-your-stomach level that it was in movies like ""Kill Bill."" For one, virtually all of ""Sin City"" is in black & white. So the blood isn't realistic-looking. In fact it looks like white CGI in most scenes. Even the most graphically violent scenes such as the quadruple amputation and the beheadings have a certain ""cartoonish"" look to them, which of course is the entire point of this movie. And the second reason why the violence isn't so shocking is because a lot of it is pure tongue-in-cheek. When you have people basically act as if nothing has happened after their hand gets sliced off or after an arrow goes through their torso, you know it isn't supposed to be taken seriously. But again, that's all part of the fun of ""Sin City.""<br /><br />In terms of acting, I have no complaints. And I certainly have no complaints about the female eye-candy either, especially Rosario Dawson and (you guessed it) Jessica Alba. Although all women are either hookers and/or strippers, they're capable of kicking serious a$$ and using their blades to the serious misfortune of anyone who crosses them.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun with this movie and would recommend it with no reservations. In terms of visuals alone, it is pure brilliance. It is stylish, well-paced, well-directed, and as cliche as it sounds, just plain *cool*. Don't wait for DVD-see this movie on the BIG SCREEN.",Sin City
5301497,B004SIPA0A, A2QAUMR0V33GC9,5.0, For Those Who Felt Screwed By DVD #1 - The Big Fat Payoff,"Anyone whose read my other reviews can tell you that I HATE multiple DVD releases.  We all know it's either the studios or the filmmakers (probably both) trying to milk as much cash as possible from the fans.  Robert Rodriguez, one of the ""young turk"" filmmakers of the '90s, I think, now suffers from the ""Lucas Syndrome"" - that is, the ""I'm justified in making as much money as I can from my artistic vision because I worked my way to the top"" mentality that true all-around film artists develop once they become part of ""the Establishment"" they hated so much as youngsters.  Maybe so.  I'd believe this too if Rodriguez hadn't earlier showed himself to be all about the fans with his previous home-video releases.  Still and all, this guy really DOES deserve it to the extent that, unlike George, he's more ""hands-on"" than anyone in Hollywood because A: he wears ALL the creative hats behind the camera, and B: the man believes - REALLY believes - in outdoing himself creatively.<br /><br />Which brings us to ""Sin City"" - the theatrical cut, the ""director's cut,"" and the DVD's.  I feel, and this is just my opinion, that the bear-bones first home release was just to get a quick cash flow and tweak Disney for the way they treated the Weinstein brothers.  How else can you explain why Rodriguez would release a version with only the Electronic Press Kit (EPK) as a ""special feature"" (and the only one at that)?  Yet it was good for the movies' sake, because ""Sin City"" was yet another bold new direction for Sir Robert.  In many interviews he was quoted that the flaw of adapting comic book titles to the screen was adapting them to the realities of motion picture. Here, he made the film medium adapt to the comics, and created something new.  Something truly revolutionary in film.  Something that was disturbingly beautiful.  He did more than make four of Frank Miller's noir series work on film - he (along with Miller, who gets a co-directing nod) made film work around the comic's artistic motifs.<br /><br />This wasn't easy.  To do it, he had to film every single actor in green screen and create a reality around them; sometimes with noone to react to where they would be later seen to be talking to another person.  It's been done before - the beautiful but flawed ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" comes to mind - but here it works.<br /><br />For those who, like me, couldn't wait for the second cut (a mistake I WON'T be repeating with ""Blade Runner"") - one might feel resentful with having to purchase yet another DVD.  Well, put that out of your mind because, not only do we get all the extras goodness - studio featurettes, an interactive character's guide to Basin City, and the quirky Rodriguez behind-the-scenes ""film schools,"" green screen rushes, party footage, etc. - but we see the complete Sin City stories recut, added to, and retold, yet again in their original format.  Sure, they didn't add a whole lot of new footage, but what's there further develops the stories as Frank Miller wrote them.

5301498,B004SIPA0A, A2FEGRJQNU51P9,5.0, this is one stellar dvd set,"There comes a time when a review of the movie will have no impact on whether or not a person will see the movie in the theatre, or even buy a DVD of the movie. I think Sin City is one of these movies because in general, Sin City is a ""love it"" or ""hate it"" movie for critics and fans alike. Strangely, I was in the middle when I saw Sin City in the theatre. I was impressed with the visual style, and I liked the look of the movie, the sound of the movie, the hard bitten over the top language and action of Sin City. I admired what the director, Robert Rodriguez did in bringing Frank Miller's graphic novels to life. But I didn't love the movie. Since that time I've read the graphic novels and I've now watched this special edition extended recut DVD of Sin City and I've changed my mind somewhat. I'm even more impressed and I like the movie a whole lot more.<br /><br />The question is why. I think the first and biggest reason is how this DVD is presented. It offers up the theatrical version of the film, which I feel is essential in any DVD edition which gives us an extended or director's cut. Let us compare. Robert Rodriguez does. The second disc of this set includes the extended and recut edition of the movie, but it's not like your typical extended edition. Since Sin City is based on several Frank Miller books and tells four different stories that slightly overlap, the recut version of the film is now four short films each with its own title card and each one has to be selected separately on the menu. I love it. This works far better for me because we get short films that are self contained and tell a complete story and I don't have to sit through two hours of film just to watch the 40 minute Marv segment ""A Hard Goodbye"". Even after watching the theatrical version, I'm not sure where the twenty minutes of extended footage came from. It's probably just 15 seconds here and 30 seconds there and not big new scenes. I can completely skip the short Josh Hartnett section if I want. This is the way I want to watch the film.<br /><br />Besides this recut version of the film, there are also some quality bonus features included on the DVD. First up is Robert Rodriguez's ""15 Minute Flic School"". In this featurette director Rodriguez talks about how he decided to make Sin City after looking through his graphic novels and saw that shooting the film would both be possible and a challenge. He talks about specific ways that he was able to save money in the making of the movie as well as how few of the major actors were actually on set at the same time, even if they have scenes together. This is a very interesting look in how this man makes his movies. Next up is the ""All Green Version"" of Sin City. This is the Green Screen version of the movie and Rodriguez introduces it, saying that he sped the film up 300 times or so in order that we can watch the entire movie in 10 to 15 minutes, but it gives us the chance to see how little the actors had to work with and how much work went into getting what we see on screen to actually be there. This is a neat feature and it is remarkable how good of a job the actors did with so little on set. We also get to see ""The Long Shot"" where we see an on set take with some background footage where Rodriguez and guest director Quentin Tarantino just let the cameras roll for 15 to 20 minutes and keep the scene going. We see some of what Tarantino says to the actors, what actually made it into the movie, and how the actors work and figure out how to play a scene. This is another great feature.<br /><br />Another feature is the Sin City concert.  This is actually just a one song clip from Bruce Willis and his band The Accelerators doing a performance for the cast and crew of Sin City as well as Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly which was filming nearby.  Surprisingly enough, Willis is quite good as is his band.  Good stuff here.  The last feature on disc two is a 10 minute cooking lesson from director Robert Rodriguez.  Here we see Rodriguez explain how to make his homemade breakfast tacos.  It looks good and I understand that he does this on his other DVDs as well.<br /><br />The first disc of this set is the theatrical version of the film with other special features.  Besides the commentary track, the other features are the obligatory ""the cars of Sin City"", ""the props of Sin City"" and other related informative but not nearly as interesting as the disc two features.  Two that are interesting are the story of how Rodriguez convinced Frank Miller to let him do the film and Quentin Tarantino as guest director for a scene in the movie.  The rest are fairly stock features.<br /><br />Overall this is an excellent set that really is worth owning if you are at all a fan of Sin City.  This set does the movie and the books proud.<br /><br />And...did I mention that this set includes a copy of Frank Miller's ""A Hard Goodbye"", the Marv story in Sin City?",Sin City

5301507,B004SIPA0A, AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,4.0," raucous, grotesquely violent, cynical, unbelievable, and very fun","This film is one of the best translations of a comic book, with great attention paid to the atmospherics, that I have ever seen.  From the moment it starts, the viewer is treated to a succession of characters and their bizarre adventures, which appear disjointed and non-sensical, but vivid with unbelievable violence, sudden death, and what are revealed to be intriguing clues to a bigger picture that is never completely explained.  It is filmed for the most part in black and white, a wonderful evocation of film noir and gotham, with occasional colors thrown in for unusual characters like the yellow man, or simply for splurting blood.<br /><br />The acting is truly excellent, starting with Willis, who once again proves capable of delivering a quirky, funny character for whom you can suspend your disbelief.  He is a sick cop, trying to do some good one last time, leading to an awful adventure.  His ward, a lovely young girl who grows into  Jessica Alba, is a pawn in a larger game that is unclear.  Then there is Micky Rourke, an extremely ugly thug who is out for revenge and crazy but also, the viewer suspects, perhaps redeemable even if he tortures some victims to death.<br /><br />Recommended.  I will definitely watch this again.  There are many nuances and clues that will come together only with multiple viewings, a bigger picture that will emerge through interpretation.  That is far better fun than a single-watch passtime film.",Sin City

It has 3 or four stories that are not hard to follow at all. The action is hardcore and the ladies of Old Town are capital H-O-T. One thing I love is the black and white of the film and how only certain things are in color. Like a red dress, golden hair, blue eyes, and so forth. Just certain features of people and places are in color, which is really cool. Sin City is one of those films that will never get boring or forgotten.",Sin City

The clarity is much better, colors pop, and you couldn't ask for a better audio track.

A cop resists and walks around this nasty marsh and does what the thinks he's right. But a dark complot awaits for him and after eight years in prison he will have to make justice by his own . The other mixed story collides with Nancy in the bar, where Marty tries desperately to seek the murder of Goldie the only woman who loved him although his ugliness (Mickey Rourke is in top form with this underground character who reminds to Johnny the handsome).<br /><br />The third story is about the last frontier, habited by women who live and survive from harassments, abuses, rapes and unthinkable touches of evil.<br /><br />The film is told, through voices in off, another honoured tribute to the Noir genre.

5301514,B004SIPA0A, A28R2Q0Y5D2AIA,3.0, A True Graphic Novel for the Big Screen,"Rating: 3.5<br /><br />This was the first movie I had seen based on a graphic novel. The film is very different; a cross between the old Batman TV series and an adult rated Anime Cartoon (Jessica Alba in tight clothing is thrown in for an added bonus!).<br /><br />I know someone who reads graphic novels and he loved this film. My stand point is from that of someone unfamiliar with the genre. It seemed that the unique visual aspect of the movie overpowered the plot/storyline. The story line(s) can get a bit blurry at times and you are then flashed with a grand visual display. It was made to truly be a ""graphic"" novel for the big screen. I saw them movie twice and now still have a hard time remembering all the storylines. What stands out in my mind is how visually powerful the film was.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie that is fast-paced, fun and at times racy (my husband truly enjoyed Jessica Alba's ""acting""), this film is for you. I did see V for Vendetta last week (this film was also based on a graphic novel) which visually could not compare to Sin City, but had a more of a true story line, was suspenseful, bold and even somewhat political and moral. Of the 2 movies I can say I enjoyed V more overall, but was glad I saw Sin City for its visual appeal.",Sin City

It does an excellent job capturing the essence of the Graphic Novels of Frank Miller, probably because of the close working relationship between Miller and the Director.  When you watch the film it feels like you are reading a comic book where the story relies more on the visual than the dialog to advance the story, and the visuals are truly one of a kind. The film is shot so it matches the story board of the comic book frame by frame down to the smallest detail.

But man I was wrong. This film was amazing. It was really dark, had alot of action and alot of blood. The movie is broken into three stories. My favorite is The hard goodbye. See theres this big guy named Marv. Not really a ladies man but he loved this hooker. She was murderd and Marv gets framed. But he won't go down easy and won't let the cops get him easy either. He beats people up or kills them or does both. The movie gets very graphic too. For example Marv tends to cut off a guys legs and arms. Or you'll see peoples heads get choped off. I'm gladd to own this 2 disc box set. You get the entire novel of The Hard Goodbye, trailers, behind the scenes including the cars of sin city, and of course the extended uncut version of the movie broken down into four stories.

5301521,B004SIPA0A, A1Y87E22UVYCE6,5.0, Great Pulp Movie!,"As a teenager I was very fond of comics, later my passion declined but I still pick up some classics as Harold Foster's ""Prince Valiant"", Hugo Pratt's ""Corto Maltes"" or the Argentinean Hector Oesterheld ""El Eternauta"" and enjoy them. So I'm not immune to this kind of products.<br /><br />One thing must be pointed out straightly: ""Sin City"" it is a violent and dreadful film only apt to be seen by adult audiences.  I suspend ethical judgment and take it as it is: a dark fantasy full of sadomasochist imagery, with all the id monsters running free.<br /><br />I was truly amazed by this movie: it is a Pulp Comic Book thrown UNCHANGED to the screen. There are perfect details: the glasses of the psycho Kevin always shining, the white blood, the silhouettes all black or white, the nude & gorgeous girls, the unbelievable gore, the amazing prowess of Marv & Hartigan, the one-dimensional ethical code of some characters and the list is goes on and on.<br /><br />IMO this is not an adaptation of a comic it IS the comic expressed with another language!<br /><br />The story is a transcription of three Frank Miller's graphic books: ""The Hard Goodbye"", ""The Big Fat Kill"" and ""The Yellow Bastard"" that are loosely related having The City as a common graphic and moody background.<br /><br />The ""heroes"" are as brutal, bloodthirsty and revengeful as the ""bad guys"" with the possible exception of Hartigan (nearer to be a Dirty Harry). Nevertheless deep inside them there is a spark of goodness and nobility that make some distinction possible.<br /><br />The dames are a special condiment: almost all of them (un)dressed in sexy exotic lingerie; showing different styles are not less ruthless and dangerous than men.<br /><br />The whole cast seems to enjoy their own performances giving a ""plus"" hardly seen lately. It is most notably in Mickey Rourke impersonation of Marv. Bruce Willis, Benicio del Toro and Clive Owen are top. Rutger Hauer gives almost a cameo as the Cardinal. Elijah Wood as the cannibalistic psycho is creepy beyond believe.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is very sensual as the teen-striper; Devon Aoki is a wordless icon with her shining sword, Jaime King is Marv's goddess duplicated and a long list continues.<br /><br />I give this product big thumb up!

The influence of Quentin Tarantino, a guest director of the movie, is seen here, as the plot format is reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"".<br /><br />Pulp drama veteran Bruce Willis plays angina suffering cop Martigan who on the verge of retirement is compelled to rescue a kidnapped young girl from the clutches of Nick Stahl a psychotic rapist and killer.

This truce is threatened when dirty cop del Toro and his boys make trouble in Oldtown and wind up getting dispatched.

There are no other films of which I'm aware that have taken the comic book (or graphic novel) format to the screen with such ingenuity and aplomb as Robert Rodriguez has done with Sin City.<br /><br />The acting is superb and the action gripping, flowing and beautiful.<br /><br />The story surrounds three different groups of inhabitants of ""Sin City"". We follow a police man (Bruce Willis) in his quest to catch a child molester/killer (Nich Stahl); a parolee (Mickey Rourke) who is set up for having killed a prostitute(Jame King); a group of prostitutes who run a section of Sin City and are headed by Rosario Dawson. The stories all come together, but not in tight neat little bundles as you many be used to. The outcome of this film noir is not necessarily a happy one.<br /><br />The graphic novel was drawn in black and white with limited usage of color. Rodriguez does the same here.

One reviewer didn't like the voice over; if he'd watched the best of 40's film noir, he'd he'd realize that they all had voice over, and for a reason: Precision. I was totally blown away with the originality of the whole thing; appropriate black & white photography, with splashes of color that intrigue. I agree with the guy who said this DVD is lacking in extras; no doubt. This project must have been so complex, I'm very interested to hear more about background stuff. The acting is excellent throughout. I particularly was impressed with Mickey Rourke, as well as Brittany Murphy. Benicio del Toro played his somewhat carricature part as if nothing could be more fun. This film is indeed a wild roller coaster of a ride, not unlike ""Pulp Fiction"", but a little more clever and even poetic. I thought the script was wonderful. This is indeed a sort of ""parallel universe"" kind of ride, and I was continuously entertained.Rodriguez' originality has strengthened my admiration of his talent. Watching this was so much fun!",Sin City

5301533,B004SIPA0A, A20IIR0422G3A5,4.0, New Chapter in film noir history. Does not transcend its source,"`Sin City' directed by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller is truly a fantasy cartoon for grown-up men. As this particular release of the film to DVD has virtually no extras, I can devote all my space to considering the movie.<br /><br />As a major fan of some both violent and avant-garde movies such as `Zardoz', `La Femme Nikita', `Kill Bill', and `Straw Dogs', my biggest problem with this movie is reconciling the violence with the art of the film. I suspect this issue is as old as the Greek playwrights and their philosophical critics. The most recent issue on this stage was the controversy over Mel Gibson's `The Passion of the Christ'.<br /><br />I think the issue can be stated as a question on the extent to which visceral reaction to illegal violence, sex, sadism, or whatever can outweigh the negative reaction to this social pathology or actually enhance the artistic experience, as the right amount of salt improves the taste of virtually all food.<br /><br />For starters, I believe there are great masses of viewers who will simply be so repulsed by what they consider inappropriate violence. To them, I give a gentle lecture on the Bill of Rights and a copy of the DVD `Hitch' or `The Wedding Date' as an alternative.<br /><br />The landmark movie for establishing the correct aesthetic for violence in film is `Bonnie and Clyde'. Many argued, correctly I believe, when the movie was first released that the more graphic violence and bloodshed enhanced the movie experience not by being titillating, but by revealing the horror of both the gangsters' actions and their demise. This argument has been successfully played out in hundreds of movies, not the least of which was the recent `Saving Private Ryan'.<br /><br />I believe the problem of relating this argument to `Sin City' is confounded by the comic book fantasy style of this film. It is really hard to make any case for the film as an examination of a gangster's impotence or an American army captain's dedication to duty in war when the main characters are plainly cut from a fantastical cloth. No one short of Rasputin survives strangulation on top of gunshot wounds on top of severe angina and lives to the last reel. The other side of the coin may be that the argument that the aesthetic of `Sin City' is classic 1940's film noir taken to its logical conclusion. This may be seen as `The Maltese Falcon' or `The Long Goodbye' as done by Rodriguez and Tarantino, with the part of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett taken by Frank Miller.<br /><br />All this is a rationalization to the fact that the pathological and unrealistic violence in this movie can put off even people who may be disposed to like this kind of movie. Basically, my sense of implausibility of the events in this film outweighed my sense of guilty pleasure from all the violence. `Kill Bill' may have taken me to the brink of that abyss. `Sin City' may have gone that one step too far.<br /><br />But what then explains the good reviews garnered by this film. Does `two thumbs way up' tell me I'm taking on just a little too much old age prudery and that maybe I have to recalibrate my aesthetic sensibilities?<br /><br />I will say that the cinematic artistry in the production of the movie is excellent. All the effects are done to a level which far exceeds that other recent blue screen epic, `Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' (aside from having a much better story as well). The only annoyance in the graphic artistry was where in most scenes, blood was seen as a bright red in this black and white world, while in one scene with one victim, all blood was white, not red. Very confusing!<br /><br />Another triumph was from the casting director. With Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer and Mickey Rourke and Benicio DelToro, we are just missing Harvey Keitel and Gary Oldman to complete our rogue's gallery of seriously dark heroes and heavies. The appearance of former (`Lord of the Rings') hobbit lead Elijah Wood is a masterstroke of casting against type. I can just imagine Wood's jumping at the chance to play this role.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the sly little graphic Easter eggs such as the makes of the various automobiles, including, I believe, a Chevy Corvair, 1957 Chevy station wagon and the great finned 1959 Cadillac. Also, while the location of `Sin City', named `Basin City' is vague, there is a clear reference to Interstate 287 that runs through some of the most darkly fabled minor cities of New Jersey such as Perth Amboy.<br /><br />The movie is based on three largely unconnected episodes with one of the three serving as a bookend to the other two, opening the movie briefly, to be picked up after running through the other two stories. It is hard to tell where Tarantino's contribution may have come in. My first guess would be as the director of the Bruce Willis bookending story, but I suspect it is more likely he directed and choreographed the scenes in which the female ninja character does her stuff.<br /><br />It is hard to evaluate the acting. There is no question that the male leads, Willis, Rourke, and Clive Owen carry their weight and that the heavies are suitably heavy, but the thin dialogue and the fantastic biology and physics seen in many scenes prevents us from really becoming fully engaged with the characters.<br /><br />The bottom line on this movie is certainly to check your critical baggage at the door and simply fasten your seat belts for an unalloyed thrill ride.",Sin City

One of the most violent movies I've ever, but a breathtaking amazing experience, I saw it in the theater and I've never seen any movie like it before. It was very different. A thrilling and electrifying story of detectives, hookers, crooks and others in a dark city who get a dose of their medicine. An allstar cast including Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Benico Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and Mickey Rourke. If like action and good comic book story telling, then this one of the best ever made.

5301535,B004SIPA0A, A1V3IO23FZFF9L,4.0, Awesome,"Sin City has all of it: a good story, excellent cast (a cast of who's who) and the best part is the cinematography. Not since Dick Tracy 15 years ago has a comic book looked so good on the big screen. The colors of the comics comes alive in Rodrigues's movie.",Sin City
5301536,B004SIPA0A, AVCRD98TH48RN,4.0, A captivating Film Noir comic book movie.,"This is easily the most stylish film to come out since ""The Matrix.""  The look of the movie uses the same experimental technique I first saw in a Francis Ford Coppola film called ""Rumble Fish"" where the entire movie is shot in black and white with certain parts of each scene colorized for stark contrast.  This idea was later polished and brought to the mainstream in the film ""Pleasantville.""  Since this film is based on a Noirish comic book the mixture of extreme black and white lighting with the colorful highlights makes for a fine visual experience.  As for the cast, most of the actors turn in good performances; the most notable being those of Mickey Rourke and a remarkable cameleon-like transformation from Benicio Del Toro.  The female characters are primarily two-dimensional buxom babes with little depth of emotion, but this film is based on a comic book for young men, after all.  There are a couple of forgettable performances given by Clive Owen and Michael Madsen.  Clive Owen's work here is wooden, and Michael Madsen is plain petrified and uninspired.  I kept having the feeling that Michael Madsen joined the project in the hopes of snaring Mickey Rourke's role, and when he didn't get it, severe apathy set in.  He was great in ""Resevoir Dogs,"" but this is by far and away the worst performance in any of his films that I've seen.  The storyline is another ""Pulp Fiction""-like yarn with disjointed narrative that jumps back and forth between three violent and seemingly separate stories that cross paths at the end of the film.  The almost constant voice-over narration can be a burden on the generic movie-goer who wants more traditional film-fare, but it fits the style of this film perfectly.  There are some tedious moments, especially since this movie clocks in at over two hours, but the final result is an exciting experience with plenty to rave about and praise.  This film is destined for the Cult Classic section at your local video store.",Sin City
5301537,B004SIPA0A, A3M1PKVP64QIS2,4.0, REAL movie fans will love this one!!!!!!!!!!!,"I always find it interesting to browse through the reviews. Everyone knows what opinions are like.......and yes everybody does have one. New and innovative films are sometimes lost on those in our society that believe that in order to enjoy a film they must be able to relate. Instead they attempt to take in a film that they do not understand and criticize harshly. When I sat down to watch this film I did not know what to expect never having read the graphic novels. Black and White film no matter in your personal camera or a Movie camera has a special quality and when mixed with just a dab of the right colors and at the right times just sets it off the same way that certain colored shirt or accessory helps bring out the best in you. The characters are amazingly compelling, semi hard to relate to with just enough 50's feel about them to give you a feeling of familiarity. This movie is not for everyone as the rating suggests due to over the top violence, sex scenes, and its very sexist portrayal of women. Interesting though that people can view the daily news of which contains the very armpit details of our world culture and then talk about it at the water cooler like its the most important thing in life, but be offended by a movie that is more akin to a piece of modern art. Open your mind, be mature about it, don't take it to seriously and just sit back and watch the fireworks that this film displays.",Sin City

The script chills while the casting humanizes every character with perfect sense and style.  Every shot allows the viewer to appreciate the time and place of the scene as well as an uncanny amount of beauty within every frame.  See the film with a mind geared toward literature, film, graphic novels, and all mediums noir; you can't be disapointed!",Sin City
5301539,B004SIPA0A, A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,5.0," What a ""Sin""","The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. ""Sin City"" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes ""Sin City,"" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike ""Sky Captain,"" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three ""Sin City"" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is not quite a ""Kill Bill"" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. ""Sin City"" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. Outstanding.",Sin City
5301540,B004SIPA0A, A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,4.0, A very unique film,"I've never read the Frank Miller novels, but from what I've heard, the film version of ""Sin City"" is a great adaptation of the comic books. Speaking as someone who isn't familiar with the comics, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Sin City"" and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in an ""alternative moviegoing experience.""<br /><br />""Sin City"" is actually made up of three different stories. In the first one, Bruce Willis plays a nearly-retired cop who puts his life and career on the line to save a young girl from a child molestor. The second story follows Marv (Mickey Rourke) as he tries to track down the people responsible for the death of a hooker who winds up in his bed. Finally, Clive Owen plays a man who tries to protect his new girlfriend from an abusive ex (Benicio Del Toro) and accidently threatens the balance of power between the police, the mob, and the girls who work the streets in Old Town.<br /><br />The film is shot almost entirely in black and white with little glimmers of color here and there (deep red lipstick, a woman's piercing blue eyes). Almost all of the backgrounds are digitally generated, which gives everything a true comic book/film noir quality. Some people might be turned off by the intense violence that is present in all three stories, but it's my understanding that the graphic novels are exactly the same way, so fans of the ""Sin City"" series will probably be pleased. I enjoyed the unique filmmaking techniques coupled with entertaining stories and fabulous performances by a large and incredibly talented cast.<br /><br />See this film in the theatre if you can...even thought it's a gritty, violent movie, it's absolutely beautiful to watch. (I also got a real kick out of seeing Elijah Wood play a ninja-style serial killer/cannibal...a far cry from his Frodo Baggins days!)",Sin City
5301541,B004SIPA0A, AZKVUJNGVE503,5.0, not for everyone,"This film is not for everyone, but I loved it.  It's another highly stylized ultraviolent movie from that dynamic duo Rodriguez and Tarrantino.  I've read a little Frank Miller, but was unaware of Sin City the graphic novels.  From what it sounds like they took a lot of care to stay true to the original graphic novels so I guess I should really be crediting Frank Miller for the way this movie looks and feels.  The stories are also quite good, though thematically typical of at least a few of graphic novels I've read.  In a world where perverts can be the next president, corruption goes to the very top, love is bought and sold, and life doesn't seem to be worth very much, What does one cling to? Live for? Die for?  Kill for?  All in all, once you get past the bullets, blood, and dismemberment, the stories are really kind of sweet.",Sin City
5301542,B004SIPA0A, A2NJO6YE954DBH,5.0," ""Frank Miller's Sin City"" (Recut, Extended, Unrated)","""Frank Miller's Sin City"" is a world where the heroes can take a whole series of punches as well as deliver them, where justice has nothing to do with either mercy or the cops, and the system is crooked from top down to pretty near the bottom of the barrel. The dames are still worth dying for and some of them might even be angels or goddesses, but others can defend themselves quite well without anyone's help.  Still, this is a world where protecting women is hard-wired into the psyches of guys like John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke), and Dwight (Clive Owen). If you fail to protect a dame, then somebody has to pay and in a way that will make the scum bucket think Hell is heaven when you finally let them go straight to there. This movie is rated R for ""sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue,"" but that is most assuredly an R that is a whole lot closer to NC-17 than it is to PG-13.<br /><br />I am not particularly happy that when I bought ""Frank Miller's Sin City"" on DVD as soon as it came out that it was the stripped down version and that a few months later, in time for Christmas no less, we finally get the ""Recut, Extended, Unrated"" DVD set.  But studios are making money off of this double-dipping and if I could hold off for years on ""Titanic"" I should have been able to do the same thing with this one, so shame on me.  But the good news is that (a) I did not have to pay for the upgrade and (b) the difference between the two DVDs, without the discount, is only ten bucks and you will more than get your money's worth here because to ease our collective pain Robert Rodriguez made sure that this 2-disc set goes the extra mile.  That is clear as soon as you open up the box and discover it includes a mini-version of Frank Miller's ""The Hard Goodbye"" (my ""mini"" I mean the book is slightly larger than the size of a paperback novel).  This is a good choice not only because it is the first ""Sin City"" graphic novel, but also because it is about Marv and as Marv Mickey Rourke steals this movie from Bruce Willis and the rest.  So already you have account for a good chuck of the extra ten dollars you are spending and then we get to the super-loaded two DVDs.<br /><br />Disc 1 contains the original theatrical release (uncut, unextended, rated).  Your other ""Sin City"" DVD is made superfluous because this has three commentary tracks: co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller talking primarily about working with the actors; Rodriguez and special guest director Quentin Tarantino (eventually) talking more about the technical aspects of the film; and an audio track of the reaction of an audience in Austin to a screening of the film.  The featurettes cover how Frank Miller was convinced to make the film, getting Tarantino to play with shooting a film digitally, and then separate looks at the cars, props, special effects and costumes of the film.  There is then a ""Sin-Chroni-City"" interactive game that looks at how the three novels that make up the first ""Sin City"" movie cross each other, and the teaser and theatrical trailers.  The two directors having a conversation while screening the film is the best of the extras on this disc, simply because I like the stories of the production a bit more than the details on how the film was made, but both are excellent commentary tracks.<br /><br />Disc 2 offers the recut and extended theatrical release and it is not the deleted scenes being worked back in for the ""extended"" part that matters here but rather the ""recut"" part.  That is because Rodriguez has recut the movie into the three graphic novels, ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard,"" along with the short story ""The Customer Is Always Right"" from ""Babe Wore Red"" and the epilogue Rodriguez and Miller came up with for the end of the film.  With the movie broken up this way it is even easier for you to watch a ""chapter"" with Miller's graphic novel in front of you to see the extent to which they actually did shoot the book on this film.  Of course the special features on this disc include new installments of Rodriguez's 15-Minute Film School and 10-Minute Cooking School (breakfast tacos).  There is also a performance by Bruce Willis with a band at the ""'Sin City' Live"" cast and crew party at Antones filmed by Rodriguez with the digital camera.  For cinema buffs the two treats are the movie in high-speed green screen, so you can see how they actually shot everything (tip of the hat to Rodriguez for protecting his cast on the brief nudity in this version), and a 14-minute uninterrupted take from Tarantino's segment (Dwight and Jackie Boy in the car on the way to the tar pits) that allows a great look at how actors and directors work when shooting digitally.<br /><br />I already thought ""Frank Miller's Sin City"" was a five-star movie that not only sets the standard for what film noir will be in the 21st century but also advances the cause of digital filmmaker.  That it brings Miller's characters and story to life while remaining faithful to his artistic style is a bonus for those whose introduction to ""Sin City"" was the graphic novels, but that was what Miller and wanted and what Rodriguez delivered with his little test run.  If you held out on getting this movie on DVD until the special features version was available it was well worth your wait, and if you have been duped into giving the studio even more of your money for this upgrade you will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that Rodriguez delivered for you as well.",Sin City

Rodriguez did an amazing job directing this masterpiece of a movie. The visualizations look like they leaped right out of Frank Miller's books. This movie looks so amazing, I could watch it with the sound muted and still enjoy it. It is so appealing to the eye to see nothing but blacks, whites, and greys. Then to have the slightest color come into play sends your mind whirling. To see nothing but black and white and all of a sudden see green eyes or red lips is a pleasing surprise. If you move past the visuals, you get the fantasic acting by a great ensemble cast. Everyone gave unbelievable performances. The other thing that is awesome is the interweaving of three seperate stories into one seamless movie. All in all, I loved everything about this movie. From the opening scene to the credits, I couldn't take my eyes off of the TV. And if you like Tarantino, watch for a scene in which he directed.",Sin City

Like some people I wanted to see this movie but got a little turned off because it was in black and white. Even though the picture is in black and white It's a nicely done picture. It's extremely smooth and crisp and it becomes beautiful when some color is added to make certain things stick out.<br />After seeing how well done it is you can't stop watching. It needed to be in black and white to show the ruggedness of the film and it really couldn't have been done any other way. Like instead of blood being red it was white and for some reason it looked cooler. The story is self-explanatory the name says it all but the twists in it are exciting and take the movie from good to great to amazing. It's a very violent and raw movie and you come to love it for that. Basically if you're looking for a movie that has a deep story and is in every way different than any other movie out then you need to see Sin City,Sin City
5301548,B004SIPA0A, ANPAEX55YFH18,5.0, Worth The Money,"Sin City is a series of graphic novels created by Frank Miller and brought to the screen by director Robert Rodriguez. The film focuses on 3 graphic novels in the series: The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard and The Big Fat Kill. The best one being The Hard Goodbye, which is about a big guy named Marv who searches for the guy who set him up for murdering a hooker named Goldie. Now, aside from all the great actors, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis and so on, and aside from the great cinematography (shot entirely on green screen), this 2 disc recut and extended dvd has it all. On one disc you have the original theatrical cut with 2 different commentaries plus loads of really cool extras like how Rodriguez conviced Frank Miller to make the film. And then on the second disc you have the film seperated into 4 different stories with over 20 added minutes plus a lot more special features such as the all green screen high speed version of the film. And even aside from that you get the first graphic novel in the series also. I would deffinately recommend this dvd even if you already own the original dvd. Becuase of all the extras and the being able to view the movie into four different stories this dvd is worth all the money. If you don't already own it buy it, and if you do already own the original dvd buy it. This dvd is hands down the best dvd of 2005.",Sin City
5301549,B004SIPA0A, A3CJBYR9PSXORU,5.0, The best movie of 2005 - a classic.,"Sin City is the closest that mainstream US film has come to capturing the essence and appeal of graphic novels.<br /><br />Visually stunning, each frame of this movie is highly stylised, no less than a work of art in itself, to closely resemble the style of the graphic novels themselves.<br /><br />It is ultra-violent, this is Pulp Fiction on steroids, and will likely thrill or disgust those who love or hate the likes of Kill Bill.<br /><br />I loved it.<br /><br />It is set in the twisted environment of Sin City, part modern day, part film noir era, where among the heroes are Marv (Mickey Rourke as an ugly hulk of a man on a trail of vengeance) and Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis doing the kind of role he was made for).<br /><br />In short, you can't take it too seriously and I find the violence totally inkeeping with the style of the movie and the work of Frank Miller.<br /><br />It's obvious that this production has gone to pains to be faithful to its source material. Therefore to make something that didn't have comic-book action and ultra-violence would have been a real sell-out.<br /><br />Fans of Frank Miller have been waiting a long time for a faithful translation of his work to the screen.<br /><br />Back when Miller produced the Graphic Novel - Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, I remember people having some hope that the remake of Batman would carry some of that film noir appeal and gritty themes.<br /><br />What did we get? Michael Keaton in a rubber suit.<br /><br />So I don't think people griping about the level of violence in this movie is really a legitimate criticism. Like Tarantino's movies, the violence is a dramatic device, and also a vehicle for humour.<br /><br />I watched this movie with someone who doesn't know the work of Frank Miller and has little love for screen violence, but they really appreciated the design, art and style that went into it.<br /><br />Plus, the storylines and source material are great with plenty of twists and turns that you rarely see in mainstream US movies these days.<br /><br />I really hope this movie will spark off sequels and other faithful adaptations of graphic novels like those from Frank Miller.<br /><br />Just to say it again - I think Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are outstanding in this film and are perfectly cast.<br /><br />This movie is a triumph and hopefully sets a new standard to be matched by future productions. Highly entertaining.",Sin City
5301550,B004SIPA0A, A1SNV0V24ND5DB,5.0, One of the best movies ever,"I'll admit it, I'm a fantasy/comic book junkie.  Hey, that's okay, comic books are now in style and it seems as if a comic book movie is coming out every other month, with a fantasy movie coming out in the months between.  Having said that, I will also say I don't like a movie because it fits that criteria.  Two examples would be ""Hellboy"" and ""Daredevil""...two movies which could have been better but were unfortunately lacking.  This all leads me to ""Sin City"".  This movie is amazing.  You either love it or you hate it, I guess.  I loved it.  It combines film noir with a very comic book feel, and extremely true to the original Frank Miller graphic novels.  A great cast in a very well filmed and written movie.  Robert Rodriguez is amazing, and his talents are put to the test here.  The recut, extended, unrated DVD is also amazing.  I'm not going to admit that I (cough) pirate movies, but my normal DVD attitude is ""why buy the cow...""  Well folks, this is a cow worth buying.  If you loved the movie, you'll love the DVD.  It has too many extras to name them all, but they're all worth it.  You get to see all 4 stories as they were originally meant to be AND the way it was released in theatres AND in a green screen version that lets you see what was real and what was CGI AND with an optional audio track from the premiere audience that saw this movie...not to mention tons of interviews with cast and crew.  This is the reason to buy a DVD!",Sin City
5301551,B004SIPA0A, A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,4.0," Well, I liked it...","While it's probably a total cliche to say it by now, Sin City really is a wild thrill ride of a movie, and quite possibly the most entertaining thing that will hit theaters all year.  Adapted by director Robert Rodriguez from Frank Miller's graphic-novel series, it's an energetic slab of neo-noir, complete with twisted characters, ambiguous morality, and deadly serious dialogue.  For those who thought the Kill Bill movies weren't bizarre or violent enough, Sin City ought to seem like a stylish, action-packed gift from guy-movie heaven.  It's filled with negativity, outrageously over the-top bloodletting, and some of the blackest humor known to man, but it all works anyway.  I even managed to forgive the incessant voice-over narration, normally a rather lazy device, because it's so oddly poignant and poetic.  It's not really that big a deal anyway, because this movie is so impressive visually that the characters could speak in gibberish and I'd probably still be moved to give it at least three stars.<br /><br />It should be noted right off the bat that Sin City is not a movie for everyone, but if you're the type who would like it you presumably know who you are.  IF you like crime movies, especially those filled with action and atmosphere, you will almost certainly get a kick out of Sin City.  If you prefer lighter, more ""socially redeeming"" fare, you may still like it, or you may be overcome with bile filling your throat for most of its two-hour running time.  It's all a matter of how willing you are to accept what's going on without asking too many nagging questions like ""How exactly did Mickey Rourke just take out ten armed riot cops with nothing more than his fists and a hatchet?"" or ""is it really possible or even necessary to manually tear off a man's scrotum?"".  Everything about this movie is utterly outsized, from the themes to the characters to the action, but in the end it's a rousing success at what it intends to do, which is entertain.  It's precisely because this movie was so utterly entertaining that I found myself unwilling to nitpick; you'll probably be too busy having your senses assaulted to linger on any problems you may have with the movie.  Nothing is more key in movies (or TV, or novels for that matter) than getting the viewer to suspend disbelief, to simply let go and enjoy what's transpiring regardless of the plausibility level.  Some of my favorite movies are wildly unrealistic, but at some point when watching them I just decided to go with it.  Sin City is one such movie: I realized early on that the events unfolding onscreen bore little to no resemblance to reality as presently constituted; I just didn't care.  I went to see this movie with my wife (who is, to put it mildly, not a fan of dark or violent movies), and she may have summed up the experience of watching it the best when she said simply ""I was never bored.""  That, ultimately, is the secret to Sin City's success: it's so gripping to watch that it's hard to care about anything else.<br /><br />As everyone (and probably their brothers) knows by now, Sin City was filmed using real actors against a black-and-white CGI background with some touches of color added for dramatic effect.  It may seem like a gimmick at first, but Sin City is all about bringing the viewer into a sort of parallel universe, so this unconventional device works perfectly.  Sin City is a movie dealing with lives on the edge, and it conjures up a delightfully dark, grimy, and gritty atmosphere to go match the depravity of its subject matter.  Weighty themes and over-the-top violence abound here, and it's only fitting that the movie's look and feel should be so uniformly haunting.  Consisting of three tangentially related stories occurring out of sequence, Sin City brings the viewer into an underworld populated by thieves, murderers, hookers, and dirty cops, and the morality is viewed entirely in shades of grey.  In the Basin City of the movie, where the good guys are bad and the bad guys are even worse, violence is often a virtue, or at the very least a prerequisite for survival.  If there's one redeeming value to Sin City's cartoonish ultraviolence, it's that it's painfully clear that its recipients generally deserve it.<br /><br />Anyway, if there's one theme running through all of these stories, it's that of redemption.  The protagonist in each tale (Bruce Willis's Hartigan, Rourke's Marv, and Clive Owen's Dwight) is a most unlikely hero (although Hartigan is just a regular cop and therefore not exactly bad, whereas it's clear that Marv and Dwight are murderers), but each finds himself driven to acts of extreme courage and sacrifice in order to see justice done.  Sin City portrays a kind of heroism not typically seen in movies (especially big-budget, sanitized Hollywood productions), one that comes from doing the right thing even when it's nowhere near being the easiest thing.  Rourke's Marv is probably the most memorable character, a hulking thug with a highly overdeveloped sense of vengeance who managed to arouse some of my sympathy even as he cut a swath of unimaginable destruction through his enemies on his way to avenging a murdered prostitute.  Out of the legions of other figures in the movie, the great Benicio Del Toro deserves some special mention as a comically malevolent crooked cop who won't shut up even after he meets his unfortunate end.<br /><br />Now, although I've gone on too long already, I'd feel remiss if I didn't talk about Sin City's staggering violence quotient.  Yes, this an extremely graphic movie, and much of the violence is downright disturbing to watch (Elijah Wood's character being cut up and fed to a wolf is a prominent example, even if much of the violence in that case was implied), but it's just as true that context is an important factor when considering just how offensive such bloodletting is.  Now, for one thing, Sin City is meant to be a piece of escapist cinema, so nothing that takes place onscreen should be taken too seriously anyway.  After all, no one got offended during the scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail when King Arthur cut off the Black Knight's arms and legs; that scene was meant to be funny and it was.  Perhaps more to the point, the violence here is so ludicrously over the top from the opening scene that it's hard to imagine any rational person getting too upset.  You have to just go with it; if you're the kind of person who makes it a point to be huffy and offended all the time you shouldn't be seeing this movie anyway.  'Nuff said",Sin City
5301552,B004SIPA0A, AQSQLWD3NLMAS,5.0, Basin City Blues,"The concept for this film started in the Comics revolution of the late 60's with incredible artists like Frank Frazetta, Jim Steranko, Neal Adams, and Barry Smith. They knew anatomy, and they used photographs to compose their backgrounds. Pre-Anime, the characters began to ""almost"" move off the pages. Frank Miller came along in 1978. He helped to inaugurate the adult graphics novels-larger formats, better paper, brighter inks-coupled to nudity and R-rated dialogue. Some of this has been around since the late 50's, but the new format was gathering speed and Miller was in the vanguard.<br /><br />Miller's graphic novel's about SIN CITY contained art in panels that broke down like very detailed storyboards. When Robert Rodriguez decided to court Miller and sell him on the idea of converting the graphics to digital video-Miller loved it. Their partnership went so far as to have Rodriguez dropping out of the Director's Guild so that he might be permitted to put Frank Miller in the credits as co-director. Rodriguez created a B&W world where color was used sparingly-and for great effect. Blood was white-or bright red. Some eyes were blue. Some hair was blond. Pale green and pale blue showed up on classic cars.<br /><br />Rodriguez assembled a powerhouse cast. Bruce Willis was first up, to boost the sales of the production and the star power. He was excellent in the film-beginning to appear very Noir-very Chandler and Hammett-a modern Bogart. Using CGI and live actors, Rodriguez was able to do most of the work in his homegrown studio in Texas. Miller created a world part pulp-novel, classic cars-and part hyper-violent martial arts and splatter film. Everybody smoked, many of them drove a ragtop-they could shoot guns with both hands simultaneously-and women, regardless of how far they had fallen-were still treated with respect. More than an adaptation of Millers comic book art-it is literally his artwork brought starkly to life. The effect is original, violent, sexy, existential-and very effective.<br /><br />The film worked off three Miller ""stories""-and the best of the three-THE BIG FAT KILL-starred Mickey Rourke. He can think of this film as his return to the big time. He is brilliant. His character, Marv, is perfectly fitted for this new genre-and his acting, and the action he precipitates-blows all the others in the film out of the water. This may be Rourke's finest performance. He has been a pro boxer, as well as actor-and he needed that physical prowess for this role.<br /><br />Everyone in the film was impressive-with the likes of Clive Owen, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Harnett, and Michael Clarke Duncan all making love, murdering, or slapping around women like Jessica Albo, Jamie King, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, and Brittany Murphy. One critic wrote,"" This is a Mickey Spillane fever dream!""<br /><br />There is a rumor that in the director's cut RR will include some deleted scenes that he shot to flush out all three of the Miller stories. It appears that a sequel is imminent-absolutely necessary. Most of us can't wait for the next installment-to cruise Old Town, prowl the Roark farm, beware of the warrior hookers, love the hot babes, dodge the bullets and swords and knives, and stare at those great cars.",Sin City
5301553,B004SIPA0A, A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,5.0," Brutal  Beautiful  Breathtaking ""City""","With any luck Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" will inspire a new genre of filmmaking - a literal union between filmmaking and the world of comic books/graphic novels.  I know, I know, there have been countless films inspired by the world of comic books which have attempted to recreate the chills and thrills.  Not one of them - even the best (e,g,, Spiderman series, Tales from the Crypt, etc.) has been remotely as successful as the creative team that gives us this brilliant, jarring, vision.<br /><br />Rodriguez, Miller and company obviously put themselves (and the cast) through painstaking paces to assure every frame, every emotion emoted by an astonishing array of live talent is instilled with the gritty, graphic hyperrealism of the world of Frank Miller.  It is a breathtaking achievement which, alas, will go unnoticed and be underappreciated by many who don't ""get"" this world.<br /><br />The cast is nothing short of remarkable:  Mickey Rourke gives his finest performance since Barfly - maybe ever.  Bruce Willis has never given a better performance than the retiring cop, Hartigan.  Everyone involved is obviously relishing having the time of their lives.  Outside of Shakespeare I can't imagine anything currently more theatrically over-the-top and satisfying than being associated with Sin City.<br /><br />For many the violence will be of too gory and graphic in nature (gorygraphic?).  Others will enjoy the rough ride but also be appreciative of the often stunning beauty of so many of this film's images.  The final tale in the trilogy of stories that make up the movie is shot with the cool and chill of winter bathed in a snow storm of such exquisite beauty that I don't find it difficult to say it is among the most beautiful images I've seen in any film.

I've watched it a dozen times and am still blown away by the dialog and gritty throwback feeling it evokes of the old 30's and 40's hard-drinking, hard-fighting tough guys. It actually inspired me to sit down the night I saw it, and jot down the outline for a Film Noir type novel that's now moved to my front burner after completion of my third novel in my McCarthy Mystery series. I just hope I can write something half as compelling as Sin City.<br /><br />The film makes no apology for the raw lust and violence and yet never falls into campy self-parody.<br /><br />But it's the film-work, the use of light and shadow and especially color that really blows you away.

5301558,B004SIPA0A, ABSX5TGEGRH76,5.0, Sinfully Awesome,"I had been waiting to see this movie for months now, and I was afraid that it would disappoint me like some other movies that I have really looked forward to lately (namely The Phantom Menace and Matrix: Reloaded).  So myself and three friends went to see it earlier, and when it ended, I thought one thing: WOW!  This was such an amazing movie, with amazing visual effects, a perfect cast, and tons and tons of testosterone-induced action.<br /><br />WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez co-directs (along with Sin City creator Frank Miller, and with Quentin Tarantino as a ""Special Guest Director"") what is, without a doubt, the most faithful comic book adaptation ever.  In fact, Rodriguez sees this film as a translation rather than an adaptation.<br /><br />There really isn't a central plot; rather, the movie is about 3 seperate stories that share certain characters and all take place in Basin City, the most morally bankrupt town ever, which rightfully earns the nickname Sin City.  To call this an all-star cast would be an understatement.  Some of the many actors included in this film are: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benecio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Britanny Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Jamie King, Marley Shelton, and Rosario Dawson (yeah, I know that's a lot), and while some of them have very small roles (Wood and Aoki have no dialogue, although neither of them have a small part), all of them are pitch-perfect in their roles.<br /><br />The movie begins with a short segment entitled ""The Customer is Always Right"", with Harnett as The Salesman and Shelton as The Customer.  Up next, is the set-up for ""That Yellow Bastard"", a story about Jim Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a bad heart who is trying to bust the son (Stahl) of a powerful Senator (Boothe) who likes to rape little girls.  Next is ""A Hard Goodbye"", a tale about a huge brute named Marv (Rourke) who falls hard for a beauty named Goldie (King).  They share a passionate night together, but Marv awakes to find Goldie dead in their bed.  A search for ""justice"" ensues, with Marv beating the life out of anyone who has information on the hit.  The story also has Gugino as Lucille, Marv's parole officer, Wood as Kevin, an amazingly gifted killer, Hauer as Cardinal Roarke (the brother of the Senator from ""Yellow Bastard""), and Sin City creator Frank Miller as a priest.  The second story is called ""The Big Fat Kill"".  It deals with Dwight (Owen), an ex-photographer (this isn't explained in the film, but there is a graphic novel that sets up the Dwight character prior to the events of this story) and now a sort of mercenary who goes to Olde Towne to help defend Gail (Dawson) and her fellow prostitutes from Jackie Boy (del Toro), a deranged maniac with a penchant for violence against women.  This segment also has Murphy as Dwight's girlfriend Shellie, Bledel and Aoki as fellow hookers Becky and Miho (deadly little Miho), and Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, a hired goon for an unnamed mobster.  Finally, ""That Yellow Bastard"" is the last major story.  It picks up after the events of the previous part of the segment.  Hartigan has been sent to prison, because Senator Roarke spun things to make it appear as if he raped little Nancy (played by Alba in her adult incarnation).  Believing Nancy to be caught by Roarke's men, Hartigan gets out and seeks her out to protect her again from people who want revenge upon him for killing (?) Roarke's son.<br /><br />These stories are extremely gritty, violent, and even a little depressing.  (SPOILER)The only one with an ending that could be considered happy is ""The Big Fat Kill"".  There are scenes involving shootings, stabbings, decapitation (or almost so), even cannibalism.  One guy even gets his genitals ripped off.  Also, there is a lot of full frontal nudity (although, from what I understand, nowhere near as much as there was in the books).  So if you feel in any way uncomfortable with any of the above-mentioned things, avoid this movie.  If not, then I highly suggest seeing this film.<br /><br />As I said, the choice of actors for this film was perfect.  I can hardly think of anyone else who could fill the roles of any characters in this movie.  Although, I must say that Willis, Wood, Aoki, Dawson, and Rourke were the big standouts in my mind (even though, as I stated earlier, Wood and Aoki have no dialogue).  Speaking of dialogue, under any other circumstances, the dialogue in this film would be terrible.  However, the actors and situations make it awesome.  Even though many lines are extremely cliched, and I hate cliches, the delivery is amazing.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning.  The film is shot almost completely in black and white.  Although, every now and then, there are splashes of color (certain cars, Dwight's shoes, women's eyes and hair, one of the villains).  Also, many of the shots mirror the panels from the comics.<br /><br />With all that going for this movie, it all adds up to a great 2-hour thrill ride.  Once again, if you don't mind excessive violence, I would highly suggest seeing this movie.",Sin City
5301559,B004SIPA0A, A19XVT1A1BLPRH,4.0, Modern Film Noir At It's Finest,"Traditional Film Noir meets Robert Rodriguez in this epic dramatization of Frank Miller's Graphic Serial, ""Sin City"".  The resulting picture is visually astounding and hauntingly dramatic.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller take us on journey through three separate stories that ultimatley intersect through out the movie. The stories include a man-hunt for the killer of a ""Perfect Woman"", an aging cop about to retire who has to complete that one last bust, and a group of women who rule the area of Basin City called ""Old Town"".<br /><br />The direction and editing of this movie are no less than we would expect from Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez reminds us that he is extremly good at what he does. The whole film is shown in Black and White and seems to take place in the 1930's, preserving the feel of Noir.  To give it a modern twist, colors and cell phones were added in.  We see a woman in a red dress standing at the edge of a balcony, a man who's so evil his skin has turned a putrid yellow, and other more subtle touches, such as Alexis Bledsole's eyes and the flashlight as it shines on Clive Owen's face.<br /><br />The over-the-top acting deserves an A+. If it were any other cast, I'd think it was just bad acting.  However, the A-List stars have taken the film ""to the next level"" (Sorry, I had to throw a Spy Kids quote in). It adds a fantasy feel to what otherwise would just be another dramatic movie.  It is similar to the acting in Molholland Drive during the dream sequence. Probably the best perfomance is done by Mickey Rourke as Marv, I didn't even recognize him st first. Hopefully Marv can do for Mickey what Cap'n Jack Sparrow did for Johnny. Elijah Wood also shows us that he can be more than just a ""Hobbit from the Shire"".<br /><br />This movie contains strong violence. A man is beaten to death, and another is fed to a dog. There are suggestions of Child Molestation, Prostitution, and a couple of characters use Religion to justify cannibalism. Though there are some bloody sequences, most use a bright white goop to signify blood, looking more like a bird pooped on them. Like Kill Bill, body parts are sliced off non-chalantly, but unlike Kill Bill, it's kept below 100.  There is also some tongue-in-cheek comic relief. Watch for the bow and arrow scene.<br /><br />Viewers who enjoy this movie will also like both Kill Bill Movies and ""Pulp Fiction"", by ""Guest Director"" Quentin Tarantino and ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" or ""Desperado"", Robert Rodriguez.  You may also want to check out some other Modern Noir Films like ""Molholland Drive"" (David Lynch) and ""Never Die Alone"", as well as Tradtional Film Noir flix, ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Notorious"", and ""The Maltese Falcon"".<br /><br />All in all this movie is a must see for Film Noir and Rodriguez/Taratino Fans alike.",Sin City
5301560,B004SIPA0A, A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,5.0, Blu-ra,"Frank Miller's ""SIN CITY"" graphic novels released back in 1991 and 1992 wowed readers when it first was released from Dark Horse Comics.  The stories were collected in trade paperbacks with seven graphic novel that revolve around the people of Basin City aka ""Sin City"".  Known for it's use of primary colors of black, white and red, the graphic novel would win many fans over for its dark and violent tone but storytelling crafted by Frank Miller known for his awesome work on the ""Batman"" and ""Daredevil: The Man Without Fear"" comic books.<br /><br />In 2005, Robert Rodriguez, a fan of the graphic novels wanted to make a film based on ""SIN CITY"" but if only Frank Miller jumped on aboard.  After seeing test footage by Frank Miller, it was enough to entice the creator to become co-director of the film and in the end, earned over $158 million worldwide in theater receipts.<br /><br />In 2005, two DVD versions were released and now, a special 2-disc Blu-ray version which includes the original theatrical and the ""recut, extended, unrated"" version is set for an April 21, 2009 and all I can say is that this release blows away the DVD versions and easily among the top 10, if not, the top 5 Blu-ray's produced thus far.<br /><br />So, does ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" achieve perfection on Blu-ray?  Read on.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" is a film that is shot entirely digital via green screen.  The digital recreations of Sin City just look dark, grimy but in a technical sense, quite magnificent in capturing Frank Miller's dark and corrupted city with its blacks, whites and reds.<br /><br />The video which is presented in 1080p (with an aspect ratio of 1:85:1) is just absolutely beautiful as you can see skin pores to absolute detail on the talent but what is more impressive is how digital and realism comes together in harmony.  What was more shocking (which you learn from the special features), in certain scenes which you thought talent were acting with other talent, they weren't.  Footage of an actor may have been shot eight months ago and then the character that is interacting with another character is shot much later and all work done in post-production.<br /><br />A perfect example is in ""That Yellow Bastard (Part 2)"" in which Shellie (Brittany Murphy) and Hartigan (Bruce Willis) are interacting but in reality, the two individual scenes were shot months from each other.  It's just amazing how everything seems so fluid.<br /><br />The picture quality is just magnificent.  It's one thing to watch this on DVD and say how beautiful the film looks but when you watch it and see it on High Definition, it just blows away the picture quality of the DVD.  Granted, this film doesn't have as many colors as top tier Blu-ray films such as ""Transformers"" or even ""Quantum of Solace"" but using the dark grays and blacks with the whites and reds, this film looks great.<br /><br />As for audio, again this Blu-ray release meets perfection.  The English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48kHz/24-bit) is just incredible.  From the action scenes to the engines of the cars, you literally feel the noise around you.  And at the end with Alba and Willis's character, nice touch of the low level bass as your subwoofer just beats.  The audio is just great to listen to and the clarity of the dialogue, music and special effects were well done.<br /><br />If you think the theatrical and even the unrated, recut edition sound good, there is also an audio track to listen to a live recording of the audience at the Texas premiere which sounds great too (I can only hope more Blu-ray releases include that feature).<br /><br />Overall, ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" achieves perfection for picture and audio quality.  Just magnificent!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />With Audio and Video reaching perfection, this Blu-ray release does not slouch in special features at all.  You are definitely getting your money's worth with so many features included.  Features such as:<br /><br />DISC 1: Disc One (Theatrical Cut) Features: This disc gives you five different reasons to re-watch the original theatrical version of the film and all are worth it!<br /><br />  * All new Cine-Explore - Innovative Blu-ray technology allows viewers to experience a uniquely interactive visual commentary that pushes the envelope. When selected, see picture-in-picture green screen footage and original art synced with the filmmakers' commentary.  This is optional and a nice touch.<br />  * 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller - The commentary between Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller is pretty cool. Miller has lived ""SIN CITY"", he knows the ins and outs to the city and its characters, so it was great to have this commentary with both men.  But mostly for Miller's perspective and knowledge.  Very cool commentary.<br />  * 2.0 Commentary with Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino - Tarentino shot the burial/driving scene for ""The BIG FAT KILL"", so he's pretty much in and out for the commentary.  Most of the commentary is Robert Rodriguez.  Where the first commentary, it was Miller driven, this one is Rodriguez driven and when the the time comes, you hear Tarentino chime in.  But it's an interesting commentary as Tarantino doesn't like shooting in digital but because it's a Frank Miller film based on a popular Frank Miller story, he gave it a chance and enjoyed the experience.<br />  * 5.1 Audio Track Featuring a Recording of the Austin Audience Reaction - Definitely a fun addition as you watch the film with the actual audience track with people cheering, laughing and just reactions during the entire film.  Sounds great and really gave me another reason to watch the film again and enjoy it.  Great addition to this release!<br /><br />DISC TWO:  This disc includes the ""Unrated, Recut Extended Version"" which has 23 extra minutes and the bulk of the special features.<br /><br />  * All new ""Kill `em Good"" Interactive Comic Book - Dive into a visually stunning interactive game that puts you in the driver's seat. Exploiting the Blu-ray format in ways never before seen, you finish the story - with guns blazing!  For a game, I was quite impressed by the audio quality.  Very well done game and using the graphic novels and artwork for an interactive comic book.  Very nice addition to this Blu-ray release!<br />  * Four Chapters: The unrated, recut version are viewed as separate films.  There are no chapter stops, so you can watch these separate chapters with new, additional footage.<br /><br />o Chapter One- That Yellow Bastard<br /><br />o Chapter Two- The Customer Is Always Right<br /><br />o Chapter Three- The Hard Goodbye<br /><br />o Chapter Four- The Big Fat Kill<br /><br />  * Rodriguez Special Features:<br /><br />o 15-Minute Film School - (15 min.) Robert Rodriguez is known for his past DVD releases of teaching the filmmaker of tips of how he accomplished scenes on a budget.  This time around, Rodriguez uses ""SIN CITY"" to show how things are done via green screen but how he did certain things to stay within budget of the film.<br /><br />o All Green Screen Version - (12:33) This is the entire film sped up in 800% but a good way to see how everything was shot via green screen.<br />o The Long Take - (14:42) This scene shows how Quentin Tarentino shot the driving scene between Dwight (Clive Owen) and Jackie Boy (Benicio del Toro).  Very interesting how this take is long and these guys are just sitting in the car for long periods of time. Interesting perspective on filmmaking with these two talented individuals.<br />o Sin City: Live in Concert- (7:15) During a break in Texas, Bruce Willis & The Accelerators perform for charity and cast of ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" and ""Scanner Darkly"" hook up and enjoy the performance.<br />o 10-Minute Cooking School - (6:21) Director Robert Rodriguez is often working late in the early morning and when he gets the munchies, he loves his breakfast tacos.  So, he shows you how to make them.<br /><br />* How It Went Down: Convincing Frank Miller To Make The Film - (5:40) What it took for Robert Rodriguez to convince Frank Miller to make ""SIN CITY"" to a movie.  Interviews with both men.<br />* Special Guest Director: Quentin Tarantino - (7:19) Interviews with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.  How Rodriguez was able to convince Tarantino to direct a spot.<br />* A Hard Top With A Decent Engine: The Cars of Sin City - (7:34) Interviews with Cecil D. Evans (Transportation Coordinator) of finding the vehicles from the graphic novels for the film.  Miller owns hundreds of die cast vehicles and used those as reference for his graphic novels.  Thus, Evans would go throughout Texas and asking owners to borrow cars for a few days or weeks such as Nancy's 57 Chevy Nomad, Wendy's `55 Porsche Spyder, Dwight's `55 Cadillac and more.<br />* Booze, Broads, and Guns: The Props of Sin City - (10:57) Interviews with Steve Joyner (Prop Master) and how he followed the ""Booze, Broads and Guns"" mentality of the film.  How certain props looked as real as the original to finding the right bow from the graphic novel in real life and obtaining it and using it for the film.<br />* Making the Monsters: Special Effects Make-up - (9:04) Interviews with Grig Nicotero (Special Motion Video Effects Supervisor) and creating the makeup for characters such as Marv, Jackie Boy and Yellow Bastard.<br />* Trench Coats & Fishnets: The Costumes of Sin City - (7:34) Interview with Mona Proctor (Costume Supervisor) going through the various costumes especially for the women like Gail (Rosario Dawson) who wore next to nothing.  Very informative.<br />* Teaser & Theatrical Trailer - The Teaser trailer is 2:07 minutes and the official trailer is at 1:49.<br /><br />I've owned the previous two DVD version of ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" but watching this on Blu-ray, I'm just amazed how much  of a difference High Definition really makes this film look and sound so incredible.<br /><br />The picture quality and the vibrancy of the reds and golds, the audio quality of weapons, cars and violence with wonderful DTS-HD audio going all around you.  This film is just right up there for one of the best releases on Blu-ray thus far.<br /><br />Again, I understand that other films such as ""TRANSFORMERS"" and ""Quantum of Solace"" which were shot outdoors looked incredible while ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" is digital throughout in terms of the cityscape and the overall atmosphere of the city.<br /><br />And suffice to say, both Blu-ray discs are just packed full of special features and enough to keep fans busy.  The first disc alone gives you five ways to watch the film and each reason is just fantastic (especially if you are a big fan of the film and the graphic novels).  The second disc was a great touch to add an unrated, recut version.<br /><br />It would have been nice to have the full theatrical film with the newer footage added to it but overall, the second disc gives you individual chapters and yet again, another way to enjoy this film.<br /><br />As for parents who wonder if this film based on a comic book is family friendly, despite the fact that blood is seen in various colors, the film is excessively violent and has its share of nudity.  So, despite Miller's work with the ""Batman"" and ""Daredevil"" comic books, ""SIN CITY"" is not a film you want to have your kids watching.<br /><br />In the end, I really enjoyed the film and the Blu-ray release.  Sure, it's over-the-top and both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have had their share of over-the-top films.  But there are few graphic novels that I have wanted to see in film and so, seeing ""SIN CITY"" as a film and with Miller involved and thus making sure the film is faithful to the graphic novels was awesome.  And just kudos to Robert Rodriguez who allowed Frank Miller to fully be in control of the film and working together with him and coming up with this unique and stylish film, the two work great together and I just hope to see a future collaboration with both men again.<br /><br />Finding a Blu-ray release that is just perfect in all four categories of film, video, audio and special features is quite rare.  Typically you get two out of four but in the case of ""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"", this release is just perfect.<br /><br />Videophiles and audiophiles are just going to love this release while fans of the film are just going to go nuts over the amount of content included on both Blu-ray discs.<br /><br />""Frank Miller's SIN CITY"" is perfect and highly, highly recommended!  A+",Sin City
5301561,B004SIPA0A, A3ILHJC852E6YR,5.0, Cool movie...not much features,"I think this movie is great to watch and really is unique.  I enjoyed this movie and all its effects.  Jessica Alba looks great even in black and white even though she doesn't have a huge part.  All the actors were great choices for the characters they played, so overall the movie get 5 stars but I was a little disappointed in the special features, or lack of.  It only has the making of the movie and some previews and that's it.  I don't really buy DVD's for the special features so it's no big deal to me but I expected more.  Awesome movie, empty DVD",Sin City
5301562,B004SIPA0A, A2UL0A8GJB4318,4.0, A Faithful and Bloody Vision of the Comics,"""Sin City"" is a brutal and violent film.  It's a noirish look at a sprawling Metropolis, rampant with corruption, greed, gore and sex.  Just try and resist it.  Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) fuses the blunt brutality with a bold and breathtaking style, propelling the story through three loosely related subplots, connected mainly through their shared theme of the exploration of the dark and feral side of humanity.  ""Sin City"" grabs you by the throat and rarely loosens its' grip for the next two hours.  If its' a story about a hulking murderer (a mesmirizing Mikey Rourke) on a rampage to avenge the women who showed him a moment of kindness, you're engrossed.  If its' a story of a loner (Clive Owen) looking to help a gang of violent prostitutes from the mob, you're hooked.  If its' a story of a beaten down cop (Bruce Willis) looking to prtect a young woman (Jessica Alba) from a depraved and deformed sexual deviant, you're glued to the screen.  Rodriguez wisely chose to frame the films' visual style around Millers' original drawings and kept Millers' pulpy dialouge intact, which exposes the stories' wounded heart better than any screenwriter could have done.  And even though the film sometimes gets bogged down in its' own visual inventiveness, you will be floored again and again.",Sin City
5301563,B004SIPA0A, A2UAOP0VUA12EQ,4.0," Rent this, wait for the special edition","Sin City is indeed a five-star film-but knowing that this DVD doesn't have all the goodies that the special edition will have, this one's good for a rent. The movie is very faithful to the comics in terms of character design, atmosphere, and even dialogue, which is quite a nice first! The music didn't really seem fitting at first (you wouldn't expect to hear raspy saxophones at the beginning of an ultra-violent movie based on an ultra-violent comic), but eventually, it really blends in with the dark, gory atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />But boy, if you take anyone under 15 to see it (I'm 16), you will live to regret it. It is SO violent, SO intense, that those with weak stomachs will not even be able to bear the soundtrack's hard jazz saxophone grunts and techno beats or the unrelenting violence that lasts throughout a vast majority of the two-hour film.<br /><br />One of the big plusses in the film is that even with such insane amounts of violence, it has a PLOT, not to mention the fact that it has a star-studded cast, filled with men that make girls cream and chicks that make boys (like me) salivate. And by that, I don't just mean Bruce Willis.<br /><br />The men that make girls drool include Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood (aka Frodo Baggins), Josh Hartnett. Clive Owen, and, for those older ones out there, Mickey Rourke and Michael Clarke Duncan. As for the chicks that make us guys drool, you got Carla Gugino, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel (Gilmore Girls), Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba. All of them, among many others. Also, fans of Japanese animation from ADV Films should know Jason Douglas, who does a good job on screen as a hitman.<br /><br />Also notable is that the film really does well illustrating the atmosphere of the comic. For the most part, the film is in black and white, but certain color effects are used (in some instances) for eyes, blood, and (in one case) skin.<br /><br />But once more, take note: do NOT show this film to a child or watch it when a child is awake in the house it is being viewed in, and do NOT watch it if you are the squeamish type, it is the most intense, unrelentingly violent film I have EVER viewed. However, with that said, I can safely say this: it's a five star film, but a four star DVD. Wait for the special edition, and rent this for now.",Sin City
5301564,B004SIPA0A, A3JJBK5BEM1IJ,5.0, The best comic book adaptation so far.,"This is a fantastic take on taking comic books to film. Robert Rodriquez's understanding of the comic book medium is what makes this film so wonderful. Even if you don't like Frank Miller's writing style, you have to appreciate the technical aspects of the film in adapting his stories to the screen. So far most comic book films are just re-created into a new story that is possible for both fans and new viewers to accept. With the exeception of Ghost World, the writer and artist has no real control of the movie. But with Sin City Frank Miller was involved as a director, so the stories stay pretty true to their roots. My only dissapointment is that there are not the traditional extra features of Robert Rodriguez DVD's. Like his 10 minute film school or mini documentaries on how he makes his films. Compared to Once Upon A Time In Mexico with the hours of extra features, I felt a bit shorted on this DVD with only one small featurette.",Sin City
5301565,B004SIPA0A, A2T3UVNNT4RRZT,5.0, Amazing,"This is a strange case: the movie is not based in the comic... IT IS THE COMIC. Here, in Mexico, Grupo Editorial Vid published the series almost 5 years ago and every comic-reader was shocked. Even now, I have a friend who hates comic-books and still, she falled in love with this one. That says a lot about the movie so for me, it's the best ""comic-movie"". I know it's full of violence but in the end, the movie is about love and frienship. How bad could it be that? Please, check it out and try to watch it with your mind open. Maybe you'll fin a big surprise.",Sin City
5301566,B004SIPA0A, A2G1W0VKQASGJ2,4.0, Cutting Edge Cinema,"I'll be short and to the point. While I don't necessarily like intense violence, this film represents what I think is sorely lacking in many Hollywood films -- A Fresh Vision.<br /><br />So much of what we see is rehashed, refried, regurgitated stuff. It lacks real creativity, a real voice, something new. Not so with SIN CITY. Whatever your tastes are, if you appreciate film, you need to see this one.<br /><br />[...]",Sin City
5301567,B004SIPA0A, A23F0RW1RUBBDF,5.0, Best Comic Book Movie,This is the best comic book movie because it is the comic word to word. The actors are all good in their roles especially Mickey Rourke as Marv which is the perfect casting choice. Though a comic book movie this one isn't for kids so don't let them watch it. The direction by directors Robert Rodriguez and Sin City creator Frank Miller and guest director Quentin Tarantino bring Miller's comic book world to life. Also great roles are Bruce Willis as Hartigan and Benicio Del Toro as Jackie Boy. Highly Recommended.,Sin City
5301568,B004SIPA0A, AXFUHII1MMR9Y,5.0, Simply Fantastic,"Sin City is probably the single best movie I have seen in the last ten years.  Now, I have been following both Rodriguez and Tarantino since they did Four Rooms back in 1995, and have done cultural analysis studies on both Reservior Dogs and Pulp Fiction (two of my favorite movies of all time) and I still think that Sin City trumps them all.  Let me put it another way.  Even if you end up totally confused by the story line and getting sick to your stomache at the violence, the cimematography alone is worth the purchase.  I was totally blown away by what they we able to accomplish; the spots of color, the complete contrast fades, the action shots are all utterly amazing.",Sin City
5301569,B004SIPA0A, A1ZOF747O5EB6R,4.0, More Surreal Than Real,"""Sin City"" is a comic book on a big screen.  Although played with real actors, the film definitely has a surreal edge where everything is larger than life.<br /><br />A synopsis of ""Sin City"" would probably be that all the violence, the plots and the characters cannot be believed at the end of the day.  Rather, the viewer is dwelling in the world of comics where heroes can take a terrible beating but still return for more and the characters are nastier, meaner and more unrelenting than could ever be the case in real life.<br /><br />I saw this film with my 18 year old son who believed it to be the most violent movie he had ever seen.  To an extent he was right although this ignores the fact that the characters were part of a modern world comic strip.  Once one adopts this mind set, the movie is more surreal than real.<br /><br />""Sin City"" has large ensemble cast and is filmed mainly in monochrome.  Yet for every black and white image, there is always one piece of colour.  It may be a woman's eyes, it may be her dress or it may be the skin colour of a baddie.  On this scale, ""Sin City"" is a technical marvel than envelopes the viewer.  There can be few films released in the past year that both captivate and repel the viewer at the same time.",Sin City
5301570,B004SIPA0A, A6ORKQ4CW15TY,5.0, Great Movie,"This with out a chance one of the best of the year. The visuals are outstanding. Also you will find yourself laughing more than you thought you would, trust me.",Sin City
5301571,B004SIPA0A, A14GKZLFA7Y1RY,5.0, Indescribable,"Sin City is, in short, a movie you must see.<br /><br />Where to start? Well, it has a great cast, direction, plot, genre... it does not have any faults. But this alone is not what makes it a great movie. Most movies today are ideas done a thousand times over, and re-hashed with new actors, but Sin City stands apart.<br /><br />It's use of colour to create drama, the cinematography, the sheer style is a nice break from the usual run of big guns, big explosions and loads of special effects action genre, of course there is a healthy dose of that too, but it really takes a back seat to the story, and how it is delivered.<br /><br />To finish up, if you even REMOTELY like movies that have cool plot twists, violence and take you on a slick thrill ride, watch this movie. now. Get off the PC and get a ticket. Do it!",Sin City
5301572,B004SIPA0A, A3JVF9Y53BEOGC,5.0, Rourke is back!,"This movie is beautiful, ugly, touching and shocking all at once. From the moment it starts, it has you in it's grip and won't let you go. It is unlike anything seen before. It is intense. It is violent. And it's tone is very dark. But it's passion draws you in. And the physical world that Frank Miller created has been faithfully reproduced by Robert Rodriguez and his team. This is a landmark movie. And the performance by Mickey Rourke as Marv is Oscar-caliber. He has vindicated those of us who have always believed he was a great actor in the tradition of Brando and DeNiro.",Sin City
5301573,B004SIPA0A, A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,4.0, No Sim City indeed,"This animated comic book is a marvellous gem that we should all see, watch and scrutinize several times a day to convince ourselves that the world has reached a no-return point. The black and white pictures are shockingly beautiful with subtle nuances in the greys and in the playing on light, or absence of light. The use of colors in that dark environment fascinates our eyes and mesmerizes our minds. The symbolic values of these colors are kind of simple though. Red as the color of blood or prostituted love is quite banal. Babylon is never very far away when red jumps into the picture. Yellow is funnier since it is the color of the arch-criminal, the senator's son. But yellow is also the color of fearful jaundice and of the cavalry, though the cavalry is not supposed to be afraid of anything and this barbaric torturer of a senator's son is not bouncing onto us to protect women and children, but rather to cut children into slices and transform women's heads into hunting trophies. The plot itself is sort of entangled : one plot in another and one crime in still another like so many russian dolls. Ir is fascinating to see all those super-heroes die and revive periodically. But the film is quite more pessimistic than Spiderman because there is no hope of an escape, no hope of a regeneration, no hope of an end to a neverending cycle of rotting and decaying because crime comes with power and power brings crime, since power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, as is well-known. So do not forget to see that film if you do not want to die in ignorance.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Sin City
5301574,B004SIPA0A, AGJLO8GK3A1SX,5.0, Film-Noir is back with a pulsating heart!,"Okay, I've seen it (and got the T-Shirt) and here's my initial words on the topic... I've tried to keep it brief.<br /><br />I had very low expectations due to some of the casting and the Digital-Video shoot. However, after seeing the evidence, many of my misgivings have been swept away. Read on...<br /><br />This is easily the best use of SFX and CGI in quite some time. STAR WARS III pales away into insignificance due to the effects swamping the story and dwarfing the characters. In SIN CITY, all the special effects are there to service the plot and characters and this blending is so seamless that one easily forgets that you're watching SFX, instead you focus in on the story and become completely absorbed by the population that resides in the hard-boiled streets of SIN CITY.<br /><br />The Noir style of the film, with all those jagged jaws, tough women and blood splattered corpses, makes this film the most visually arresting of the last few years. It really has pushed the envelope in what can now be done to illustrate a story and create a credible world for the characters to inhabit it. Absolutely magnificent imagination at work here and all the artists should be commended for giving us such a vivid creation. This is easily the best comic-book adaptation ever committed to celluloid.<br /><br />And what a gargantuan task it must have been for Frank Miller to adapt most of his novels into one cohesive story! He makes the art of script-writing seem so easy. Other writers should take note and follow in his footsteps. Anyone who saw the recent film THE JACKET knows what I'm talking about here.<br /><br />The performances are very convincing and no one actor overshadows the others. This ensemble piece is spellbinding and, once again, is there to showcase the diverse stories rather than glorifying individual characters. This allows us to become immersed in the world of SIN CITY and watch, almost like a fly which spies from a wall, the different people as their paths criss-cross the bars and alleys of the rat infested city.<br /><br />The music and soundstage is also carefully tailored to bring out the best details and deliver realistic sounds of a city losing it's soul. Robert Rodriguez delivers a pulpy music track that blends smoky Jazz, salty Brass and the thumping electricity of glass being cracked with bare feet. Bullets buzz like wasps and knifes slice the air in vindictive whooshes that scratch eyeballs.<br /><br />Tarantino, Miller and Rodriguez have given film connoisseurs a movie that will tickle their taste-buds. They have shown great innovation and new areas have been ploughed for future generations to mine and explore.<br /><br />SIN CITY is a landmark film that deserves to be seen on the big screen, it oozes class and style and will give you old fashioned entertainment. Stinky juveniles should stay well away and allow adults to savour this Pulp-Noir.<br /><br />Okay, I'll shut up for now...<br /><br />Recommended.",Sin City
5301575,B004SIPA0A, A3M87TPG0WX5NI,5.0, A Hell of a Movie,"I would best describe this movie as cinematic chocalate. You might feel bad a ingesting it but you sure do it enjoy it while it's happening. I really enjoyed this movie becasue it was gritty and very true to it's graphic novel beginning. Also, I have to add that the sequence with Micky Rourke as Marv is probably the best 40 minutes of the movie. Definately worth purchasing.",Sin City
5301576,B004SIPA0A, A2ZHDCYYP1PL2K,5.0, Sick but Sinsational,"I feel guilty for loving this film, but there you have it. ""Sin City"" is ""Pulp Fiction"" with even less redeeming moral value. If you're easily offended (pretty much by anything), stay far away. Otherwise, sit back and revel in this movie's noir-soaked atmosphere.<br /><br />I've not read the Frank Miller graphic novels upon which this film is based, but I've seen the illustrations, and I have to say that ""Sin City"" triumphs in bringing the look of the comics to the screen. I'm not usually a fan of style over substance (I seem to be one of the few that thought last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" a dismal failure), but I could have watched Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's stunning monochrome compositions all day. Not since Dorothy opened the door of her house on to a Technicolor Munchkinland has black and white cinematography been juxtaposed to color more effectively. The CGI effects are flawless, and a terrific and audacious pulpy score pulses throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Three equally bizarre stories are interlinked, again a la ""Pulp Fiction,"" and brought to life by a cast of not-quite-above the title stars: Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood (creepy as hell!), Michael Clark Duncan. The only box office actor is Bruce Willis, who plays a role that fits him like a glove, that of the melancholy hero past his prime who wants to prove he's got one more knockout punch in him before he's KO'd for good.<br /><br />The only reason this film rises above cheap titillation is that everyone involved with it commits 100% to a common vision of what the film should be. There's something admirable about the way the filmmakers refuse to compromise their (admittedly) disgusting visions to appease the moral conservatives, or to get a lesser rating, or to make more money at the box office. ""Sin City"" is a movie for adults that appeals to the thirteen-year-old in all of us, and what fun it is.<br /><br />Grade: A",Sin City
5301577,B004SIPA0A, AS558SNWF1DXG,4.0, A labor of love for fans of the books (+one reader's regret),"I'm a huge Frank Miller fan and when I first heard that ""Sin City"" was being made into a movie, I shuddered.  I could just imagine what Hollywood would do to it: cast it wrong, colorize it, water it down, change crucial plot points, sap it like ""Howard the Duck.""<br /><br />My spirits lifted when I learned it would be directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, though I wasn't sure what to make of the fact that so much of it would be digitally generated.<br /><br />In the end, it's hard to imagine another filmmaker making as seamless a print-to-screen adaptation as this.  The characters all look right, the panels were obviously used as storyboards, and Rodriguez brings just enough of his own spark to the direction to make it unique.<br /><br />I liked this movie a lot but at the same time, it left me feeling a little strange.  It's like seeing your favorite indie band suddenly catapaulted from obscurity to arena-sized stages, hearing your favorite obscure song become a Top Ten hit.<br /><br />It also made me wish there was a way I could've experienced it without having read the books first, because if you've read the books, you know almost every single thing that's going to happen when and how it's going to happen.  That's more a criticism of myself as a reader/viewer than it is of the artist or filmmakers. On the other hand, as close as the transition is, the material still unavoidably loses something when recreated in live action, just by the nature of the severity of the actions.  Miller's sharp images are paced as precisely as rifle reports and there's a strange difference between, say, seeing a drawing of Marv dragging a man behind his car and seeing several seconds of footage of Marv dragging a man behind his car.  Still, had I been given the choice between seeing an accurate adaptation and a bad adaptation, I definitely would've chosen this one.  This is what you'd call an accurate adaptation.",Sin City
5301578,B004SIPA0A, A1SPB225CVTRUU,4.0, Mickey Rourke's Career Revival Role!,"Frank Miller's Sin City is by far the best comic book adapted film in recent years. It's got very well written characters, and the often brutal and stylish actions is very unique and refreshing along with the mostly black and white cinematography. It's a very entertaining movie, but it's not easy to follow for anyone who hasn't read the graphic novels, because it's got three interconnecting stories that isn't neccessarily consistent in it's time frame. Also the over two hour long film is obviously heading for some sequels since the story didn't end when the movie was over.<br /><br />This is probably Mickey Rourke's career revival role since he has the juicest role that require him to looked semi-distorted, very muscular, endure various heavy-duty fight scenes, and he's got some very funny moments as well. With more screen time compared to other leads, it's unfortunate that he didn't even receive top billing like Willis, Alba, and Owen. He played Marv, and he's a street wise guy trying to track down the man who killed his hooker girlfriend Goldie(Jaime King). Kevin(Elijah Wood) is the scary and skillful hooker-eating mute that became Marv's relentless target. Elijah Wood had several scenes that consisted of fights with Marv, and he's so creepy different than his Frodo character.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is Hartigan, and he's the only good cop left when everyone else is corrupted. He was betrayed by his colleque Bob(played by the underused Michael Madsen) when he helped saved a little girl named Nancy Callahan, and ended up in jail for eight years. Nancy(Jessica Alba) grew up to become a pole dancer at a night club, and she eventually fell in love with Hartigan despite the age difference. Jessica Alba is very stunning on stage, and she was pretty convincing when she had to French kiss Willis.<br /><br />Clive Owen played the ""Babe Magnet""/Dwight, who had a thing for helping the local prostitutes through hard times. Rosario Dawson is Gail, the leader of a group of highly skilled prostitutes. She was in some serious trouble when Miho(Devon Aoki) mistakenly killed Jackie Boy(Benicio Del Toro) and his men. Jackie Boy is an abusive husband to Shellie(Britanny Murphy), and a corrupted cop. Since Dwight has a thing for Gail, he was willing to do anything to bail her out. Devon Aoki is very striking as the lethal assasin with great martial arts skills and works as Gail's top sidekick.<br /><br />Other secondary characters include Yellow Bastard/Rourk junior(Nick Stahl), Senator Rourk(Powers Boothe),and Lucille(Carla Gugino) are very well played even though they have limited screen time.",Sin City
5301579,B004SIPA0A, A27CHILBK6HIL2,5.0," Rodriguez's Vision Is Stunning, An Incredible Film Noir","MOVIE: In an interview, Robert Rodriguez stated that instead of bringing the world of graphic novels to film, he wanted to bring film to the world of graphic novels. Boy, did he hit the nail on the head. Rodriguez has all the respect I can give to him because he is a conservative filmmaker who churns out epic products. His first film was made for $7K, and ever since he really tries to make movies for less. Rodriguez recently entered the world of digital filmmaking, his last film, Once Upon A Time In Mexico, was shot entirely in HD using digital cameras, no film. He raves about how easy it is to edit, just plug it into the computer and badabing! Sin City was shot all digital and it aided Rodriguez in accurately capturing Miller's vision.  The movie uses three story lines from three seperate novels by Frank Miller. One is called ""The Hard Goodbye"", which follows a man's journey for revenge after a cannibal rapist who killed his one true love. The interesting part is that this one true love was a hooker that he spent the night with for the first time.  Marv is played to perfection by Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood is absolutely menacing as the cannibalistic killer. The second story is called ""The Big Fat Kill"", in where Dwight (Clive Owen) tries to protect the prostitutes of Basin City from a menacing sex starved guy but ends up sparking a war between the cops and the hookers who previously held a truce.  Finally comes my favorite plot, ""That Yellow Bastard"". This is what noir is all about, the story of a cop coming to the end of his run trying to protect an innocent girl from a pedophile madman, he ends up framed for the crime and after 8 years in prison he sets out to protect the same girl only she's 19 now rather than 11.  Everything was done entirely with chroma key (Green Screen), and since it was in black/white it didn't feel cartoonish like Star Wars did.  Rodriguez uses light to highlight faces and shadows that make an incredible effect.  The only colors in the movie are red, blue, and yellow, which are the primary colors.  Green is used twice, and I'm trying to remember if they incorporated the fact that blue and yellow make green, but I can't remember, so maybe I'm just over analyzing with the green.  The movie has a lot of personal narration from the characters, and it's not narration of what is going on plot-wise but rather their personal thoughts to the action that is happening.  One great line from Bruce Willis is after punching his partner in the face he says to himself, ""Hell of a way to end a partnership"".  Although the lines are sleazy and obvious at times you have to realize that the kind of dialogue used here is a trademark of the noir style. ""That Yellow Bastard"" was definately the best story of them all because it had emotion to it, ""The Hard Goodbye"" was great too mainly because of the character of Marv, and ""The Big Fat Kill"" had some shining moments too but trailed off the radar a few times.  The only problem I had was that the narration in Marv's storyline dragged a bit, but overall Robert Rodriguez's talent in film combined with Frank Miller's talent in graphic novels makes one hell of a tribute to film noir.  This is pure entertaining filmmaking at its best, it's all style and one hell of an experience.<br /><br />ACTING/DIRECTING: Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke shine in full glory. They couldn't have gotten any better actors for these roles. All the characters in a film noir are hard-boiled and cynical, and these two played it to perfection.  The ensamble cast is endless and everyone was top notch except for Jaime King as Goldie/Wendy, she just can't act. As it goes for the artistic vision, well, does it really need explaining? I mean, brilliant use of shadows and light, using the primary colors only when something needs to be emphasized, and capturing emotion through the setting. One of my favorite scenes was when Bruce Willis' character was framed and in jail for 8 years, he first says that he is alone. The jail cell seems to be floating in an endless darkness, it's all black around the cell.  Then comes Quentin Tarantino, who is really only being used as a marketing technique, but you can sense that disturbing Tarantino style and wit during the movie.  Rodriguez and Tarantino are best buddies, and really I admire their admiration for classic films and film styles. Tarantino's Kill Bill films were tributes to Kurosawa and Leone, while Rodriguez's ""El Mariachi"" trilogy is a tribute to Leone's ""Man with no name"" trilogy.  Anyway, Tarantino stopped on the set one day and Rodriguez wanted to show him the digital HD way of film, and let him direct this one scene where Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro are in a car and Owen starts imagining things in his head.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Robert Rodriguez is the man.  He gave up his DGA (Director's Guild of America) membership just so that he could have Frank Miller as a co-director, he really wanted Frank with him at all times so that they could get this one done perfect to Miller's standards.  In his recent films if you pay attention to the credits you'll see Robert Rodriguez's name pop up several times.  He does his own music, his editing, cinematography, writing, and directing. With Sin City he directed, did the music along with John Debney, and did the visual effects. He takes the workload to make it good, and he knows how to make it good, so I'm not gonna argue",Sin City
5301580,B004SIPA0A, A3M2WW0PO34B94,5.0, If Loving This Movie Is A Sin...,"Rest assured, ""Sin City"" is like no other film you have ever seen.<br /><br />""Sin City"", directed by Robert Rodriguez (""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Spy Kids"") and Frank Miller (the creator of the graphic novels the film is based on) tells a number of stories, which share characters and themes. A cop with a bad heart (Bruce Willis) attempts to save an eleven year old girl, Nancy, from the sadistic killer, Junior (Nick Stahl). Marv (Mickey Rourke), a gangster, trawls the streets looking for the person who killed the hooker he slept with last night. Another gangster (Clive Owen) leads the abusive ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of his girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) into Old Town, an area run by hookers.<br /><br />Each of these stories pays homage to Film Noir, a type of filmmaking prevalent in the late 40s and early 50s. Every so often a filmmaker will take a stab at recreating the genre, with mixed results. Rodriguez appears to have been inspired by the source material, because this is not only one of his best films, but also one of the best modern takes on Noir. ""City"" has all of the trademarks of classic Noir; black and white cinematography, heroes and heroines trying to live in a corrupt society, villains trying to maintain control and desperate, desperate people.<br /><br />Like much of the ""Spy Kids"" films, Rodriguez shot most of ""City"" in front of a blue screen. Basically, he filmed the actors in front of a blank wall and added the backgrounds and special effects later. Many films use this technique for part of the process, but ""City"" appears to have been made using primarily this process. Almost all of the film is shot in black and white. This might be problematic for some, but I completely forgot about the lack of color, until he used brief glimpses of color. The backgrounds are richly detailed in shades of black, white and gray. They also appear to be consistent, helping to create a believable world. Because I believed in the setting of the film, I didn't miss the color. Color is used as a punctuation point. In some scenes, the red of blood appears, in others, the gold of a woman's hair. This creates a unique, interesting visual style, which appears to be inspired by the source material. Rodriguez also moves the camera to replicate graphic novel angels, making us believe that we are in a living comic book. Normally, all of these `tricks' would serve to draw the viewer out of the story and universe. In ""City"", it all serves to draw us in.<br /><br />The unique visual style is only the first element necessary to make us believe. The second, and perhaps most crucial element, are the actors. Frequently, in a movie based on comic books or similar material, all of the work is put into the visual. The actors walk through the story, spouting their lines. In ""City"", every one of the actors, and there are many, portray their characters in a serious way, as though they were in a run of the mill crime drama. No one lets on to the fact that they are basically in a live action graphic novel. Because they believe, this helps us believe, adding further to the creation of ""Sin City"" as a `real place'. It is difficult to say there is a lead in the film, but Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba all take on meatier roles in the interconnecting stories. They are joined by Elijah Wood, Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Michael Clarke Duncan, Josh Hartnett, Michael Madsen and a collection of young starlets. In any film with different stories, and this many actors, each person needs to make an impact and make one fast or they get lost in the shuffle. A lot of this has to do with how central the character is to the story; if they have a lot to do, they will be on screen more. Also, in Noir, the stories are usually accompanied by voice over narration from the lead character. In each of the stories, the main characters provide voice over, giving us insight into their thoughts. Hartigan, played by Willis, is steely, determined and effective. Marv, played by Rourke, whose plastic surgery is covered with enough make-up to make him resemble a Dick Tracy character, embarks on a memorable journey. Owen and Del Toro are also effective as they battle each other in Old Town, with the help of a number of very deadly hookers. All of these actors do a great job of helping to make ""Sin City"" all the more engaging.<br /><br />The interconnecting stories will probably bring ""Pulp Fiction"" to mind for many. When a major star appears in the first five minutes of the film, you get the feeling that their character will return at another point, probably the finale. The interconnecting stories share timelines and characters, creating a larger more interesting portrait. I find it interesting to watch a filmmaker's career and trace the `ancestry' of their films. In ""Sin City"", Rodriguez uses the digital technology that he used effectively in the ""Spy Kids"" trilogy, but takes it to another degree. He combines this with the sort of violent story that he has told well in previous films like ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" and ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"".<br /><br />""City"" is hard-boiled Noir. As I mentioned, color is used sporadically throughout. There is a lot of violence and, thankfully, Rodriguez only occasionally shows the blood in color. More often it appears as a milky white. He uses red as a punctuation point, drawing our attention to the actors or action; occasionally, red appears in a pool of blood, or in a person's shoes, or in a hooker's dress. This doesn't diminish the effect of the violence, it enhances it. Nudity also has a place in Sin City and it is the most gratuitous element of the film. Somehow, this is also fitting. You would expect nudity to be fairly common place in a town known for its sin.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is one of the most visually interesting and challenging films I have seen in a long time. It has a dazzling visual style all its own, combined with a hard-boiled story and some very good performances, ""Sin City"" will be remembered for years to come.",Sin City
5301581,B004SIPA0A, A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,5.0, One of the best movies I've seen!,"I doubt there's any movie you will see this year that will be as good as Sin City. it's visually stunning, sexy, full of great lines, unforgettable characters and suspenseful action. The cast is great too. Micky Rourke shows why he should be in more movies as Marv. Marv is a kickass character  who's out for revenge against the people who killed his love Goldie. Micky Rourke is just simply awesome as him and should be even nominated for best supporting actor.<br /><br />  The rest of cast are really good too but not as good. Clive Owen (King Arthur, Closer) who I didn't even know existed until last year is also extremely cool as Dwight. He goes after  the dangerous Benicio Del Toro and winds up starting a war between hookers and cops. So he has to set to make things right. The heroes played by Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis all have  soft spots for women. Willis ""who's also the best he's been in awhile"" has to protect the sexy Jessica Alba from the Yellow Bastard.<br /><br />  The Yellow Bastard is a sleazy pedifile who tried to kill  her when she was little but was stopped by Willis. The cops are crooked though and put Willis in prison because he wouldn't take blame for raping the girl. The Yellow Bastard's father is the mayor and owns the cops so he can get them to do anything he wants. When Willis gets out of prison he finds that he put Alba's life in danger by finding her and leading the Yellow Bastard straight to her. So he has to protect her one more time.<br /><br />  This movie is just great and director Robert Rodriguez's crowning achievement. Since he gets some directing help from Quintin Tarantino and Frank Miller I don't know if he'll get the best director nomination he deserves. Anyway he does here what every director who adapts a book should do, get some insight from the writer to make sure it's done right. This movie isn't just right though...it's done perfect. After seeing this I think  Rodriguez is the only person that could bring Stephen King's Dark Tower books to life as well.",Sin City

It was also very violent and had a lot of hot women in it. Alexis Bledel and Jessica Alba both looked great in this film. I can't wait for the sequel.,Sin City
5301585,B004SIPA0A, A2TJMNDHSGN3H5,4.0, A very diffrent action film,"Most action films today, or in any day, rely on special effects and explosions more so than plot and character development. Although ""Sin City"" is not a complete exception, it is a stand out from other ""click, click, boom"" action movies.<br /><br />The movie comprises of interlocking stories throughout involving different characters. These stories aren't like ""Seinfeld"" where each of them dose something different that somehow relates to each other and everything is resolved at the end. Much like the story telling of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"", the movie is shown out of sequence, to relate with each character's segment.<br /><br />The acting for the most part is what stood out for me. Excellent performances by Benicio Del Toro, Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood, who gives one of the most creepiest villain performances I've seen, without uttering a word.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez is quickly becoming one of my favorite filmmakers. Not only did he co-direct the movie, he ""shot and cut"" it (yes that is an actual credit, just look at the back of the DVD) and directed the music as well. I guess when he made a movie over a decade ago with a $7,000 dollar budget, he knows how to do different jobs.<br /><br />The only fault in ""Sin City"" is that it is hard to have a strong connection with the characters. When one dies, and many do, you don't have such a strong feeling as you would, say if the movie surrounded one character. The only ""main"" character seemed to be Bruce Willis. Yes he seems to be reprising his role from ""Die Hard"", but he dose it well, and for me was the one of the only characters you cared about.<br /><br />Final thought: The movie is not as violent as you are lead to believe. Kill Bill or the Matrix was more violent than Sin City, but the violence is in a ""comic book style"", and to sum up what that means here, the blood is almost entirely white...",Sin City

Maybe that's why I didn't like it.<br /><br />In all truthfulness, it was a REALLY good movie.  No use in doubting that.  It was a REALLY good movie, and yet...<br /><br />  ...I didn't like it.<br /><br />Apart from being just a little too long, by the time we reached the half-point of the film, I was already sick of it.  Yes, it's called ""Sin City"" and there is a reason why it's called ""Sin City"", with all the violence and brutality and sleaziness helping the film live up to its name--its title, but the fact of the matter is, they exhausted all those entities, along with others, to the core.<br /><br />In the first hour, I was amazed by Sin City.  Its luminescent, lucid, at times blazing, grades of black and white.  Its piercing action and racy dialogue.  The unexpected outbursts of red, yellow, green, and blue.  The characters you find yourself enchanted with, the characters you rush to hate and hesitate to love.  All this, the first hour gave me.<br /><br />But then, the film ran on....and on.  They exhausted their use of violence, gore, and brutality.  It really did make me kinda sick.  There were parts at which I felt like gagging.  Too MUCH gore.  Too MUCH brutality.  ""Sin City"" &lt;--no lie.  Maybe I should of expected all that ""sin"", but really, they exhausted this word, too.  Many characters got the sh*t beat out of em.  Likewise, this film got the sh*t beat out of it.  By gore, by brutes, by sleazy, twisted men, who made me feel like screaming.  I sat, writhing in my seat, finding no other solution to my fuming awkwardness.<br /><br />They threw the blood at us, and it became annoying.  An overly excessive use of gore.  I can take it in moderation, hell, I can take a lot.  SIN is not just gore.  Makes you wonder if they realize that.  GORE is a product of sin, but it is not its equivalent.<br /><br />Once again, this film is REALLY good.  But I didn't like it.",Sin City

5301588,B004SIPA0A, AWDFOM2D4PTZD,5.0, My Critique,"When I go to the movies, I want to see stuff I haven't seen before. I don't want sequels, retreads of TV shows from my childhood nor anything with Matt Damon trying to be Jason Bourne.<br /><br />This movie is like nothing you have seen before and ( sorry to all the nay-saying reviewers ), simply ground breaking and fresh.<br /><br />Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez take hardboiled noir crime fiction and compact it into a diamond of a movie, shot through with hardboiled lugs, an honest cop and oh-so sexy dames.<br /><br />Let me address the movie's critics one at a time.<br /><br />a) No good guys.<br /><br />That is so palpably untrue. The three principle male character are all good guys - all trying to do what's right in the confines of the moral murk in which they find themselves. The bad guys aka the true murderers and the Mob all die - some really horribly in forms of almost karmic payback.<br /><br />b) The picture demeans women.<br /><br />No it doesn't. If they were all pathetic objects to be used and thrown away and potrayed as such, that might be an argument with some validity. The girls in Old Town are all in charge of their lives and are quite possibly the strongest group characters in the movie. Even Goldie makes a conscious choice when she seeks out Mikey Rourke's character. She isn't an objectified victim and he ( monster that he is ) loves her for the kindness she has shown him.<br /><br />c) Cheesey voiceovers.<br /><br />Some people never seemed to have heard of Chandler or Hammett. The dialogue fits perfectly to the movie. Like the line from Chandler ""It was a blonde. The type of blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window"". You can imagine both Bruce Willis' or Clive Owen's characters saying THAT line.<br /><br />Even Mikey Rourke's last line is so pitch perfect to his character. The entire dialogue is spot on for the genre.<br /><br />d) People are shot, pounded and pulverized and don't die.<br /><br />It's a movie, from a set of graphic novels. That's the genre. Heck the end of ""The Wild Bunch"" is pretty similar, but that doesn't detract from that movie being the greatest American film of the 20th century. And isn't it really what you want in a movie, the good guys to keep getting up and the bad guys to go down horribly? That's oh so satisfying on a fundamentally moral level. I'm not looking for ""realism"" in movies, that's not why I go. If I wanted that, excreable flicks like Gary Oldman's ""Nil By Mouth"" would have been a box office smash and people would have seen Ewen MacGregor's ""Young Adam"".<br /><br />d) Jessica Alba's relationship with Bruce's character.<br /><br />Disturbing? Yes. Probably meant to be and Bruce realizes it's wrong and ultimately does something about it. He does the honorable thing. As I said previously, all the principle male charcaters are essentially good guys and do the right thing in the end. Ms Alba's motivation? I can quite easily accept that her affection for the one man who ever showed her kindness could, over time in a place as morally bankrupt as Sin City, become something deeper for her ( and so more difficult for him ).<br /><br />e) The stories not connected.<br /><br />They are if you stay to the end. Just not in any kind of grand way. The characters all cross paths, that's all. That's OK with me. Everyone doesn't have to know everyone else.<br /><br />To conclude, this is one of the best movies of 2005, a perfect fit of style and more style.",Sin City
5301589,B004SIPA0A, A359IT81FBX64Y,2.0, Miller's Maniacal Manga,"There is no denying this movie's technical and stylistic excellence, but Sin City is a pretentious film noir wannabe. It takes gratuitous violence to uninspired levels of depravity, and it pretends at a plot by interweaving multiple storylines and characters, all of which is too clever by half and amounts to a house of cards. This is a movie in which every male character is either a killer or a cop (sometimes both), and every female character is a Black Belt prostitute. Almost nothing makes sense, so you must watch the film as a pure sensory experience - albeit a very gruesome one. Some characters possess supernatural powers; we never discover why. I liked Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, but even though Sin City adopted elements of those two films, I absolutely hated it. If viewing two hours of violence and torture is your idea of entertainment, then by all means, see this movie. If it is not, stay away. At best, you will feel bored; at worst, you will feel disgusted. This film creates a new genre: The Sadomasochistic Fantasy.",Sin City

5301594,B004SIPA0A, A16Z4CUXYD9U27,5.0, Get over yourselves and think...,"I have quite a few things to say after seeing this movie and reading almost every review on this site.  Every comment from those that loved it to those that hated it.  From the 15 year old that shouldn't have been let in the theatre w/o his Mommy in the first place to the ""top-rated critic"" that prolly had more expectations then all of us put together before they even went in the theatre.  I'm not saying each person doesn't have their own basis for their opinions, but it seems everybody has pre-conceptions for a movie of this hype long before they even give it a chance.  Drop your expectations and you'd be surprised how much you can enjoy ANY movie.  However, I'm going to start with my personal opinion and try my best not to include any factual information yet so bear with me:<br /><br />First things first, people that cry and whine about the gore and ""degrading"" representation of women and nudity and the fact that you can't relate to the characters - what exactly did you in all your teenage/feminist ignorace expect from a rated R movie called ""SIN CITY""?  It's seems to me that so many uptight people automatically see or hear something that SEEMS a certain way and they don't bother to think into the hidden meanings.  The hookers that show skin but are tough as nails simply show the adversity and determination of women to struggle through the pimps and killers and fight back the only way that ever gets things done.  So many bleeding hearts want to believe that war is bad, but they shouldn't deny the fact that the changes that COME from war are necessary.<br /><br />Secondly, I am an aspiring actor and a movie buff beyond many peoples' understandings.  Do most of you nay-sayers even understand how difficult it is to ""act cheesy""?  I've done quite a few theatre shows, and as a mandatory skill, you have to overact.  You HAVE to be cheesy to appropriately pervey the meaning behind the plot.  I truly believe the acting was exceedingly excellent and not as easy or crappy as so many of you haters think.  Each charater was shown in the way they needed to be from the pages of the comic by their respective actors/actresses.  When a director tells you, ""Ham this up and be corny!"" you friggin do it and hope you do it well.  And they all did just that.<br /><br />Finally, again, only as my opinion, I believe this movie was an original, complex, risque masterpiece that needed to be done before someone else did it WRONG.  Do you people truly believe the directors/writers said in the middle of a scene, ""Hold on!  We shouldn't put that in, people might get offended.""  Gimme a break folks, what the #@$! do they make movies for?  Movies are an escape from reality and are meant to tug at your emotions, even if that happens to be disgust or hate.  Actually, do you haters dislike this movie because maybe it's a little TOO close to reality for your tastes?  Does it scare you only because this seems to be what our world is working towards?  Good deeds are never rewarded...evil lurks everywhere, even where you least expect it...the beauty that you see on the surface doesn't always match underneath...  That's what this movie really shows and I think it bothers alot of you.  This is the underbelly of what our planet is slowly building towards and that makes you mad that we can enjoy it as entertainment.<br /><br />Now, the facts:  This movie was as original as they come.  It had very distinct lessons to learn from EVERY character.  It had star power that each showed off, if anything, their diversity.  It is true to the comic and is an amazing genre-bending story that has been attempted and failed at every time...until now.<br /><br />My suggestion to anyone reading these reviews that hasn't seen it (or that have and simply want to hear others' opinions), don't think too hard when you watch it.  Don't pick apart what you do and don't like about each scene.  Watch the movie and, at the end, decide for yourself.

5301598,B004SIPA0A, A1W0ODR0SK9H4R,5.0," Simply, A Must See","I only expected good things when I heard that there would be a film adaptation of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novels, and after seeing this movie I can safely say that it was above and beyond even what I thought it could be. Robert Rodriguez really brings Miller's frantic and colorful (although not necessarily in the film, no pun intended) world to life, and makes the lines between comic and movie blur. Everything from the story to the cast of characters is nothing short of stellar as far as ""Sin City"" is concerned. Add in some outrageous (and sometimes gruesome) special effects, and a guest directing spot by the heralded Quentin Tarantino, and you have the formula for one of the best and most original movies to hit the silver screen in years. Short of nothing, this is a must see for fan's of Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino, and the Sin City series.<br /><br />The story may be somewhat confusing to some as it does jump around a bit (thanks to guest man Tarantino's patented directing style), but most should be able to piece everything together because it all relates to one giant overview in the end. The cast is perfect for the movie. There is really not one person from this film that I would take out, or anyone else I would add. You have the obvious eye candy of starlets like Jessica Alba (Nancy), Britanny Murphy (Shellie) and Rosario Dawson (Gail) to hold over the audience, while, well known actors like Bruce Willis (Hartigan), Mickey Rourke (Marv) and Clive Owen (Dwight) give the film plenty of credibility. The characters are developed wonderfully, and each has their own agenda/means for being in the film (like many I will never look at Elijah Wood the same way again). The story flows well actually for jumping around a bit, but that is what gives the film its special feel, and one that makes the viewer know this is a worthwhile experience. Without revealing too much of the plot line of the movie (which trust me you will want to find out for yourself as it is so good) the film basically takes from three of Miller's graphic novels, ""The Big Fat Kill"", ""That Yellow Bastard"" and ""The Hard Goodbye"", which if you have read any of the comics or novels you will probably be familiar with. Marv (Rourke) spent the night with the woman of his dreams, a hooker named Goldie, only to awake and find her dead of the bed next to him. Being framed for the murder, Marv escapes and vows to find out who indeed killed Goldie. Along with that Hartigan (Willis) has just awakened from his injuries he suffered while saving Nancy (Alba) when she was a child, only to meet back up with Nancy, who is now stripping at a popular night club. And all the while Dwight is trying to protect the city's prostitution brigade, after they mistakenly kill an officer. The way that the story fits together works almost perfectly considering that going from one frame to the other is not exactly the easiest thing to do.<br /><br />About those who have complained about the movie. I've noticed that most people who have given this movie bad reviews or trashed it have concentrated on two major points : the violence and the unrealistic events. As far as the violence goes, yes Sin City is extremely, extremely graphic. However if you were to take any of this away from the movie, everything ""Sin City"" was centered around would falls to pieces. Not to say the movie is dependent on its violent content, but in reality these stories come from comics which are most of the time graphic in nature (don't even ask about graphics novels). The violence though is very cartoon-like, so I can't really imagine anyone being genuinely offended for seeing a bloody character appear on the screen. As for the unrealistic qualities the movie has, like I said it comes from a comic book series. I'm guessing a lot of people who have complained this movie either don't know this, or haven't read comics/graphics novels. Basically the movie portrays what happens in the novels to a T, and complaining or trashing the movie for being unrealistic or violent shows not only close-mindedness, but an unwillingness to accept that there are other ways to create authentic ideas. At some point people have to learn how to suspend their disbelief.<br /><br />""Sin City"" was and still is easily one of the most pleasurable viewing experiences to come along in quite some time. If you are a fan of the Sin City series, or any other movies which Rodriguez and Tarantino have been involved in, you are in for a spectacular treat, because this is definitely among the best films that either has been a part of. If you have no idea about any of what I have said or you haven't seen or even heard about anything related to the two directors, this is still a worthwhile movie to see, if only for it's uniqueness. There's plenty of interesting plot developments, likeable/ hate-worthy characters, and stunning effects to hold almost any viewer over. There's not much more I can say, except that you should really see this movie. Do so right away.",Sin City

It's the mental cruelty of various characters at various moments that lingers, not the physical actions so much.<br /><br />What's striking is just how utterly dark, no ""dark"" is too weak a word, utterly BLACK of a world this film pulls you into.  Totally amoral sadistic savage anarchy, there are of course good and bad guys but even the good guys are just a few shades less twisted.  And it's saavy, in the socioeconomic and sociopolitical sense---we see a world of vast corruption and cruelty underneath the everyday sucker's illusion of normalcy and respectability.<br /><br />The all-star cast shines, even cinematic lightweights like Jessica Alba are well-directed enough not to screw things up.

None more...,"With apologies to Rob Reiner for paraphrasing the immortal SPINAL TAP line about ""Smell the glove"" album cover which could not get any blacker lol.<br /><br />This movie is neo-classic noir, not simply for its bold shooting in black and white against green screens. Frank Miller the comic genuis that attracted me to Daredevil back in the late eighties, then went on to renew my interest in Batman authored a series of graphic novels in the early nineties called SIN CITY. I have not read the graphic novels but remember skimming them back when they originally came out.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller then adapted said comics into a live action motion picture, with a small cameo directing appearance from Quinten Tarantino. Is the end product as dark as it could be, it surely is pitch black with characters like Bruce Willis's aging detective, Brittany Murphy's waitress and Jessica Alba's kidnap victim turned stripper to name a few lost souls populating Sin City.<br /><br />The actors including Benecio (can't currently spell last name sorry) turn out excellent performances, but it is Mickey Roarke's Marv and Clive Owen's Dwight that steal the show.<br /><br />Miller's dialogue is crisp and edgy with dark humour counterbalancing the sheer splashes of blood red colour onscreen.<br /><br />Like Pulp Fiction the narrative of the movie is split into three vignettes, which led some reviewers I believe to critique the repetiveness. I forgive this however with the knowledge that the movie is maybe the closest adaptation of a comic ever lifting shot for shot and almost word for word from the source. Therefore if one views movie as three interconnected stories as opposed to one long one the repetitiveness may not be such a factor.<br /><br />This movie appeals to the comic collecting young crowd, but also to a crowd of older moviegoers that like innovative directing, searing action, ambigous morals and plenty of action in their movies.",Sin City
5301603,B004SIPA0A, A3AF8P0GINFADV,5.0, A Decadent/Indulgent/Slasher of a Movie !,"Without being familiar with Frank Miller's graphic novels, I did not know what the essence or analysis of ""Sin City"" was, all I knew was it was apparently a film that 'embodied' what some people feel is the real vision of the comic book. Of course, this depends on who you are debating with but to a novice like me, it was an engaging, no holds barred, Maltese Falconesque detective story with great character-driven stories intertwined.<br /><br />So many famous faces in this film yet does celebrity ensure quality? Overall, the famous faces in ""Sin City"" pay off, for example: Mickey Rourke was brilliant as Marv -- a troubled actor but onscreen, he is at his best. Bruce Willis flexed some acting muscle here and I didnt even think of ""Die Hard"" once -- his performance showed that he has matured -- could a comeback be in his path? Some people think the famous faces are distracting but they add a menacing quality film (remember Woods as Frodo? think AGAIN. he was excellent as Kevin and not to mention Benicio del Toro who was so convincing that you might not even recognise him despite that makeup)<br /><br />Some people may say that this film objectifies women as trophies, raging Amazons etc but I think it links with the themes of corruption, decadence and lost innocence. Jessica Alba has come a long way since 'Dark Angel' - she has a certain luminous quality to her that translates through film. Rosario Dawson is crazy in this film - the contrasting women (the brazen Brittany Murphy, innocent Alba, the silent but deadly Devon Aoki) in this film is what I think adds depth to the female presence.<br /><br />Last Thought I: visually stunning, fast-paced adventure yet with thought-provoking symbolism (a corrupt priest allies with a disturbed cannibal of a boy? Miller would make one hell of a sociologist if he pursued this point further).",Sin City
5301604,B004SIPA0A, A233QN6P2EEKPS,2.0, Huge Disappointment,"Any filmmaker that dares to try an adaptation of a comic book faces many problems. In order to put page to screen within a tidy two hour package, it is absolutely necessary to change elements of the comic that will get even casual fans up in arms.  Also, comic books overwhelmingly tend to feature characters and events that defy reality, making special effects take front and center over the characters that are often the main appeal in the first place.<br /><br />Director/Editor/Writer/Composer Robert Rodriguez has managed to circumvent some of those problems while taking others head on. Sin City is based on a black and white comic book series that very few people in the audience would even recognize. Rodriguez left the Director's Guild of America to bring artist and writer Frank Miller on as co-director to duplicate the comic panel by panel. In the process he effectively sidesteps any criticism from hard-core fans. Going in the opposite direction for effects, Rodriguez takes a story that could be done with very few special effects and no computer imagery at all and completely soaks each and every black and white frame with as much technical wizardry as he can. Shot entirely with digital cameras and using very few sets, it is clear Rodriguez had a ball making the picture, but as all students of film know, making a good movie is about as fun as a root canal with no painkillers.<br /><br />The plot itself consists of three interweaving tales dipped in incredibly gruesome violence, rolled in hard-boiled noir, and sprinkled with macho male fantasy. Indeed, the three heroes soak up bullets like a tank and don't die, and every woman in the movie is either a stripper, a prostitute, or just plain naked. The first and by far most interesting tale is that of Mickey Rourke's Marv, a hulking brute of a man who relentlessly kills his way across the computer generated Basin City to avenge the death of a prostitute. Next up is Clive Owen butchering an American accent as Dwight, one of those people who doesn't seem to have a specific role in society but who still manages to get himself and an entire town full of prostitutes into grave danger. Ending the miniature trilogy is Bruce Willis as John Hartigan, a cop with a bad heart(literally) that protects a girl from a repulsive but powerful pedophile. Aside from Rourke, the star-studded cast is generally calm and unmemorable. Most surprising of all is the normally reliable Willis, who speaks his lines as if he has a sore throat and is reading them from a note card held up by a production assistant.<br /><br />In adapting Frank Miller's excellent work to screen, Rodriguez brought everything but the kitchen sink and the soul. Style and effects is the name of the game here, with the story itself a very distant third. Despite the ferociousness of the violence, it fails to make an impact as the film never ratchets the emotional intensity of the characters to anything above a whisper. When Willis' character struggles through a heart attack to save a young girl, he seems more like he has a bad case of diarrhea than a serious heart condition. Noir style dialogue that lights up the comic book falls completely flat when said with the painful lack of flair demonstrated by the majority of the cast. The strict adherence to the frames of the comic is a fatal flaw. The lack of versatility in the shots leads to awkward moments that resemble the type of cartoon the film needs to avoid. A subtle but deeply damaging aspect is the music, which attempts to be noir but sounds like it was composed a few hours before prints were to be shipped out to theaters.<br /><br />It is interesting that both Rodriguez and Sin City are so frequently compared to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Rodriguez and Tarantino are good friends, and Tarantino even ""guest directed"" a short segment of Sin City. As I watched that segment, I longingly thought of Tarantino's films, celebrations of all that is film and pop culture, bringing the best elements of both together. Sin City definitely has similarities with Pulp Fiction, but where Sin City lacks a serious consideration for the thoughts and feelings of its characters, Pulp Fiction revels in any and everything to do with the people on screen. Watching anything by Tarantino gives you the awe-inspiring sense of watching a master at the top of his game, while Sin City just makes you sadly shake your head at a big kid playing with his digital toys.",Sin City

The only other one that comes to mind offhand is ""The Beach,"" an uninteresting, shallow book turned into a charmingly trashy film about thoroughly unlikable characters.<br /><br />""Sin City"" (the film) stands in a more complicated relationship to its source material, however. Miller's original comics are breezy reads that function more or less as summaries of Dashell Hammett (and hence have their parallels not in Hammett, but in flatter exploitations of Hammett's innovations such as the Mike Hammer novels). Graphically, Miller's books look more or less like a series of stills from cheap old Warner Brothers movies.<br /><br />""Sin City"" (the film) hence is several steps removed from its noir spring, an imitation of an imitation of an imitation; without having read the original comics, viewers will find little of interest here: there are no plots as such (only set pieces), no motivation, no background, nothing but ritual evocations of noir archetypes. Hence, there is nothing to invite casual, uninitiated viewers into the evocations. Viewing this film without context would be like listening to prayers in a religion one has no background in: there wouldn't seem to be any purpose or grounding to any of it.<br /><br />Viewers, however, who have either familiarity with noir stuff or, specifically, Miller's comics, will find the film enjoyable and satisfying. The moving images (many of which touch in passing on compositions identical to those of the comics) are more appealing than the comics' images, inasmuch as the movie's pass too quickly to allow the staleness prolonged viewing of any given image (as happens when viewing a comic) that's simply an imitation of earlier moving images to develop. (This implies, of course, that watching ""Sin City"" in theater is probably more satisfying than watching it in a form in which the view can control the image delivery rate).<br /><br />The performances of the players, for what it's worth, are sometimes fairly good, sometimes excellent, and sometimes bad, though for me ""good"" means that I'm not constantly aware that ""oh, that's Actor Y."" Hence, here, Mickey Rourke is excellent and Bruce Willis poor.<br /><br />The film is striking visually, and use of color is better than with the heavy-handed print version of the same stories. This difference is, I suppose, one imposed by medium. Likewise, the other differences in treatment may be largely to do with medium as well.<br /><br />Now that I think of it, I'm happy for Frank Miller with this work: he does a better job the second time around with the ""Sin City"" stories and milieu.

5301616,B004SIPA0A, A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,5.0," What the phrase ""moving pictures"" really means","This is s perfect, and I mean absolutely perfect translation of the Frank Miller books of Sin City, a bunch of them, into movement. Rather than trying to create a continuous feature-length film, the filmmakers--Robert Rodriguez, QT, and Miller himself--have forged separate stories, just as Miller's books are, so that characters live and die in the space of five, ten, 20 minutes. But that's cool.<br /><br />What makes this so different is the amazing visual look and feel. Miller creates his graphic novel stuff in stark black and white with splashes of red--for blood, lipstick, passion (in the form of a red dress), and the thrill of action. Red bursts through here in the film too, right from the get go. Becky wears a bright red dress, has bright red lips...<br /><br />Speed (as in velocity) is here too, as is brute strength and eruptions of violence. The sere wizened face of corruption turns up, time and again. The hardened look of the men and women who've seen too much bad stuff--bad as in what people do to each other--to look happy ever again. They move from one frame to another, giving life to these emotions in a way that you just can't do on the printed page, even if it's illustrated.<br /><br />Cops and hitmen, hookers and psychos are all here. So what's the message? It's that we don't do what we should, do we? We treat each other badly and that's true even if we have a badge or a title that says we're not supposed to. Has that message been thrown out to us before? Sure. But the way this film does it makes it totally fresh and unique. This is an original piece of work like nothing else out there--sure as hell like no other ""comic book adaptation"" we've seen before.<br /><br />A completely different take on how to move a ""comic book"" into cinematic form, a whole lot of filmmaker folks should take a lesson from this.

I'm a tax collector.,"This is an uncompromising and equally graphic adaptation (Rodriguez called it a ""translation"") of Frank Miller's series of vivid graphic novels, filled with thoroughly noir images and over-the-top comic book dialogue (some of which reminded me of HEAVY METAL in the old days), shot mostly in black-and-white with color overlays where they serve a purpose (i.e., Junior and blood in general, except when the blood is white). The story lines used were ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard,""as well as the short piece ""The Customer is Always Right"" -- and the story titles all appear in the dialogue. Mickey Rourke is almost unrecognizable as the bloody-minded warrior-god Marv, Clive Owen is terrific as the good-guy-bad-guy Dwight, Elijah Wood is downright creepy as the cannibal-ninja Kevin, and Bernicio Del Toro makes a good Jackie Boy, especially as the dead body version. Bruce Willis does a very good job playing a Bruce Willis character, in this case a vengeful cop. Jessica Alba is always extremely watchable, though her acting this time isn't very impressive. (The only one they missed getting for this film, who really belonged in it, was Christopher Walken.) And Rodriguez is obviously a major fan of Miller's work. There's also a lot of Tarantino-esque recursion in the plot line (not to mention that the character of Miho is straight out the Crazy-88 in _Kill Bill_, and so are her weapons), reminiscent of _Pulp Fiction_: The beginning isn't necessarily the beginning, nor is the end the end. Of course, there's a _Sin City 2_ coming, and then _Sin City 3_. I'm pleased to say this is a film your parents (or, in my case, my wife) will hate, with no redeeming social values whatever.",Sin City

I garantee you joy, for hours!<br /><br />The extra stuff gives you a great view over the making of Sin City, everything from the cars to the costumes.<br /><br />And the comic book is a bit small. Way smaller then the original size but its still great.<br /><br />so that doesnt stop me from giving this produkt 5stars.<br /><br />If you like Sin City, havnt read the comics yet THEN this produkt will probably be the best purchase ever.",Sin City

The storylines that weave in and out of each other are fantastic although the dialogue is wooden at times (although I think that this is intentional.) Its strange how disturbing most of the plot lines are and yet, I was not disturbed by the movie in general.  The violence and sex are not for the faint of heart (keep the kids out!)  Overall, one of the most unique movies to come out in decades.",Sin City

5301622,B004SIPA0A, A37XGUQ1VH0XM6,5.0, Noir to the Nth Degree,"First of all, this isn't really a movie, it isn't really even a collection of short stories on film- and it wasn't intended to be! What this is, is practically a frame-by-frame reconstruction of three of the greatest graphic novels ever written. If you were looking for a ""movie"" then you probably ain't going to get it.<br /><br />If, however, like me you love the original Sin City graphic novels, then you are going to love this. It is pretty much a companion piece to the original artwork- and closer than I would have believed possible. Now if they can only do the same with Miller's ""Dark Knight.""<br /><br />The spirit here is classic film noir- in fact, it's more noir than noir, yet without appearing campy. But yet, it isn't quite noir, because the attitude is clearly one of good vs. evil- and good wins. Good may get the hell beat out of it and resort to hyper violence, but it wins. It wins because the innocent are either protected or avenged. Yeah, maybe these are morality plays, but they are good morality plays. Marv was my hero before I saw this- and he is still my hero now: ""That the best you can do, you Pansies?""<br /><br />The primary special feature here is an interview with Miller, the other directors, and the main actors. It is well done and their enthusiasm for the project shines through, which is unusual for Hollywood (the original ""Sin City."")",Sin City
5301623,B004SIPA0A, A2H22I2RWE0HOV,5.0, Sin Cit,"Are Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez comic book geeks?  Yeah.  Bigtime.  Is it any wonder that they were able to talk the hesitant Frank Miller into making his pulp comic dynasty Sin City into a movie?  Porbably not.  They tried awfully hard and Rodriguez first treatment did make a pretty impressive splash with creator Miller.  Hence, a comic book movie is born.<br /><br />Probably the first comic book movie.<br /><br />Sure there's Batman and Superman and X-Men and Spider-Man and blah-de-blah-blah.  But one:  None of these movies were filmed by Tarrantino and Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Two: These movies were adaptions of comics turned into movies.  Sin City is a comic book turned into a comic book movie.  Hard to explain....unless you've seen it.  Miller is a great artist (he worked on the Marvel Limited series of Wolverine in the mid-80's) and he has a certain vision.  Rodriguez did not want this to be Frank Miller's Sin City as portrayed by Robert Rodriguez.  He wanted Frank Miller's Sin City.  Period.<br /><br />I think he got that and a helluva lot more.<br /><br />Do you need to be a Comic Book Geek to love this movie?  No.  It would help.  But it wouldn't be a prerequisite.  In fact, after viewing the movie, on having liked it, you may have a new-found appreciation of comics in general.<br /><br />To cut to the chase.

This is how movies based on graphic novels should be shot. So the original literature comes to life. Not in a cheap knockoff movie that only loosly follows the source material like other films. I only wish ""V for Vendetta"" was being done with the respect to the original style and vision Sin City was. That is a fantastic graphic novel and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Anyway, I feel sorry for everyone who bought the first version, they'll have a harder time reselling it after this expanded one comes out. But really, this move was so obvious. The origianl version has such a short list of DVD extras (almost none) that everyone should have known another version would be coming out, so I didn't buy the original. This is EXACTLY what happened with Pulp Fiction, and today you can't even find the original DVD release in video rental, they only carry the ""Collector's Edition"".",Sin City

There are also scenes that will definitely bring to mind ""Kill Bill"". If the movie itself doesn't grab you, the way in which it was filmed WILL. This has fast become one of my all-time favorite movies, destined, I'm sure, to become a cult classic. I absolutely recommend it!",Sin City
5301628,B004SIPA0A, AVR3F6VQYIMZW,5.0," A gritty, violent, sexual, and powerful film! Excellent!","As a reformed comic book collector, I had never read any of Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels but I had heard about them. And everything that I had heard had been positive. Then when I heard they were making a film based on a few of the novels and the it was being directed by Robert Rodriguez I was very interested in what would happed. But what really sold me on the film was hearing that Frank Miller himself would be co-director of the film. To think the man behind it all, the creator, would be involved in the film gave me very high hopes. Well after seeing the film I was not disappointed. This is one of the slickest pieces of film making I have seen in a long time. I love how the film is done all in black and white with color being used only when neccesary, mostly in the case of blood or the color of a character's eyes. The film reminds me very much of portions of the graphic novel that I have seen. In fact the whole film seems like the graphic novels come to life. The way each stories weaves in and out of each other reminds me of a comic book. This film has one of the most diverse casts I have seen. A unique blend of both old school actors (Rutger Hauer/Bruce Willis/Powers Boothe) and up an coming stars (Alexis Bledel/Jessica Alba/Rosario Dawson). But the stand out actor in this film has to be Mickey Rourke as Marv. At first you don't even recognize that it is Mickey ROurke but as the story proceeds you realize that it isn't Mickey Rourke, not anymore. Because he has truly become Marv and plays him well. It is as if Rourke identifies with the character which more than explains why he plays him so well. But I want to tell you this film is not for young children. It is a very violent film and contains nudity. In fact a friend of mine who is a die hard horror fan rented this film at my recommendation and did not finish it because she felt it was too violent. But do not let the violence scare you away from this film. It is all part of the plot and does not come across as unecessary. In fact it is integral in telling each story. I highly recommend this film and you will not be disappointed and I am looking forward to a sequel.",Sin City

Originality, imagination and pure talent are three words that comes to mind when I think of Sin City or what he did with the Dark Knight.  Half of the artists/writers today wish they had even a fraction of what he has.  Just the pure ability to exercise what you've been gifted with on a consistent basis.<br /><br />This is the first comic book movie that I have seen that is about 99% PERFECT translation of the comic book.  If you loved this movie do yourself a favor and check out the Sin City graphic novels.  After that treat yourself to the Dark Knight or Hard Boiled.  His artwork and writing is incredible.  Good job Frank!<br /><br />Thank you Mr Rodriguez for bringing the classic Sin City to life.",Sin City
5301630,B004SIPA0A, A13EV9JB9W06EW,5.0," Excuse me, dare I say you seem to have a bit of an axe sticking out of your forhead","(some small spoilers)<br /><br />This is the closest I think anyone has ever come to adapting a comic to film, it's not just adapted to a film like so many other comic to film renditions, the comic *is* the film. At points it reminds of Casablanca while meeting a massive bloodbath. Bits of color flash or blend making you notice key emoting, physical acting, action, personallity and scenery effect that reflect what's shown in comic pannels. There are also amazing comic style angles brought to life in the cinematography. Any key moment in the again hyper-styleized  action, violence, scenery and purposfull pulp novel/ comic over acting is highlighted, close uped or strangely angled to reflect and emphisize exactly what the comics do while at the same time being alive. truely the most original cinematography in a very very long time. But if your looking for a fairly realistic stylized film working with common logic you've come to the wrong place. It's an exersize in harsh gratuity in a dark and almost alternate world and it couldn't be more satisfying. Everything is overblown and defies physics and all reality, human characters dive through windows of moving vehicles, smash faces through brick walls, talk to the decapitated, have specialty killing skills take out massive amouts of people avoiding utter oblivion through common comic (and film) deus ex machina such as the jammed gun at the last second, hookers look like fettish models straight out of expensive european modeling agencys and run city sections territorally, and don't forget the ninja, and theese are just to name a few. The story (like everything else) is utterly gratuitous in disturbing, fleshy, smoky, grimy, gritty sequences of terrible events with only the good the sick and the sickest (characters). A brilliant peice of film that will hopefully be rememebered for it's trail blazed in black, white, blood, booms, badabooms and bullets for decades to come. So yeah, I loved it. Go America!",Sin City

It was film noir at its finest. The movie consisted of several loosely connected vignettes. The heros were the following: an old, tough, but straight cop; an extremely ugly and extremely tough ex-con, with his own moral code; and a murderer on the lam, he had plastic surgery, but his sense of public duty led him into trouble. The villians were extremely evil and powerful, but there was a cosmic justice in this world, and the bad guys got a type of justice.

Well I borrowed it from a friend and finally watched it. Let me say, I was not disappointed. The movie told a interweaving story of three or four characters...and it was very engrossing. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because of all the narration, it was alright but could have delt with a little less of it.

Doesn't even have the trailer on it.  This is just like the LOTR in that they had the cheep one then the very nice 4 disc set.  If you loved this movie and didn't download it get it other wise wait until the great 3/4 disk set comes out.  IT was very disapointing that there was almost no extras.

Black and white scenes and absurd colors make this movie very unique. Players (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen) performance are great. There are three stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) in the movie, each is very interesting. In the first story, Marv wants to find killer of his girlfriend just got from the bar. Secondly, Dwight protect his girlfriend from ex-cop and try to prevent chaos caused by him, and finally Willis try to save young lady who saved long time ago and got into jail due to her.<br /><br />This is another digital masterpiece and very creative story.

Robert Rodriguez hasn't made a movie this good since From Dusk Till Dawn in 1996. However I think he has found an entirely new element and I hope he makes a sequel to this awesome flick soon.<br /><br />I am not even going to comment on the amazing cinematography and style of this film because it's so obvious that it is top-notch. I will comment on the story though - a strong one that molds together to fit into a story that comes together in the end without ever confusing the audience as to what is going on and who is who. The dialogue seemed like it had been written by Tarantino himself, sticking to the classic, bold lines that make you grin and really root for the characters. Even Jessica Alba did a great job in her acting! I do wish Britney Murphy would have been in more of it, she is a great actress and so underrated, in my opinion. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, and Mickey Rourke all did a great job with their characters as well.<br /><br />Great movie, but definitely one to keep kids away from. It is extremely gruesome (not so bad since it's in black and white) and it steps across new boundaries in mainstream film.

5301644,B004SIPA0A, A1CGRM83IQNBGE,5.0, Visually Stunning Reproduced Film Noir,"The task, or the responsibility, of a director to take on a project involving the adaptation of a comic book is crucial.  It is crucial in respects of getting the job done.  It is critical for the director to capture the spirit of the story, characters and setting.  If this is not achieved, then the project fails.  This is why most comic book, or in this case graphic novel, adaptation to film does not achieve the superiority that Sin City surpasses.<br /><br />This is the best comic book or graphic novel film ever made.  Frank Miller's Sin City is a creation beyond the imaginative nightmare.  It has style with fashion, affection and hate.  It chills your bones, makes you squirm forcing a smile out of you where you can't help but feel the adrenaline-charged images on the screen as if you were experiencing them.  Robert Rodriguez has ingeniously redefined ""reproduction"" in a new postmodern experience.  The replica on the screen is incredibly audacious and it achieves itself as a visual masterpiece, exploring our subconscious of colors and graphic images with characters we love to hate and hate to love.<br /><br />Done on a scale of almost all computer generation with no real sets, the film captures the reality of the environment the characters are situated in that we do not feel in the CGI that we are exposed to, or see, in films like Troy (2004).  For most films, computer generation does not work because actors do not act real to the environment.  In Sin City we have a story and setting that fits the medium that Rodriguez and Miller create.<br /><br />Sin City has three intertwining stories told at separate time periods involving us much like Pulp Fiction (1994).  These stories follow Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Dwight (Clive Owen).  They work within a framing device that opens and closes the door on us in the world of Sin City.  Hartigan is an almost sixty year old cop trying to catch a pedophile (Nick Stahl) that has kidnap a young girl named Nancy.  He is beat, broken down and worn out, but understands his duty and will cross the line to get it done.  Marv is about two or three times the size of a defensive lineman who is out to seek justice for the murderer of Goldie (Jaime King), a hooker with a ""heart of gold.""  He loves her and will stop at nothing, no matter what the consequence, to seek equity in his eyes.  Dwight wants to protect his girl, Shellie (Brittany Murphy), from Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro).  He is a cool clever guy that accidentally gets involved in a war.  This is the story where Tarantino puts his signature as the guest director.  The stories each start our engines with interest with Hartigan cracking down on the pedophile, Marv waking up next to a dead Goldie, and Dwight in a jam with Jackie Boy and his girl.  The film follows these three stories but involves us in many others with vividly fresh characters played by Rosario Dawson, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett and numerous others.<br /><br />The film recreates the film noir of the golden days where the characters on the screen acted as gods of cinema.  This film is visually stunning and the characters are just as extreme as the stories.  Sam Spade couldn't even survive this town.  Miller, Rodriguez and Tarantino give Sin City a touch of elegance and a bath of brilliance.",Sin City
5301645,B004SIPA0A, AMCH34Z0KHD41,5.0, One of the All-time Best Comic Book Movies,"After much hassle, I at long last go to see SIN CITY, the movie version of the classic Frank Miller graphic novels. I sit through 20 minutes of previews, including one for HITCHIKER'S GUIDE<br /><br />which I'm excited about (I dig Doug Adams), and the tedious STAR WARS 3 : SITH HAPPENS, which revolted me to no end.<br /><br />The movie begins. (WARNING: I don't give much away in this review, but at this point I do give away small clips).<br /><br />Love the opening. Great mini which sets up the feel of the city and hence, the feel of the movie.<br /><br />Love the tragic Bruce Willis short. Glad to see Nick Stahls working.<br /><br />Then, we get right to the good stuff: MARV.<br /><br />The Marv segment steals the show for me, hands down. I love anti-hero stories, I love intense violence and gore, I love insane cannibal stories and I love Mickey Rourke (good to see him in a bigger role again). This segment had it all and then some! Whoever thought Elijah Wood could be scary? Better yet, who ever thought there would be a flick where Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood brawl!?! Marv is a superb anti-hero: he's mean but to the right people, he has self-loathing and a disorder, he reflects on the old days when he kicked everyone's assess, one of his only pals is a lesbian, and he goes nuts when anyone roughs up a woman.<br /><br />But although he easily takes the cake here, let's not overlook the other goodies.<br /><br />The next act, featuring the incredible Benico Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and some bloke named Clive who I've only elsewhere seen in I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD (which sucked while I watched), was good but I didn't care for Clive. He was too bland for me. Too David Duchoviny. Other than that, it was smokin'. Benico shined bright as always.<br /><br />Bruce Willis returns in a wonderful grand finale. I was particularly fond of Nick from IN THE BEDROOM as Junior/Yellow Bastard. What a sickeningly good show he put on. He looked like what would happen if John Malcovitch and Big Bird had a child together and then locked it in a fruit cellar for thirty years.<br /><br />The stylish noir of the film is genius, the stark B&W with the touches of burning color. It's hypnotic and gorgeous.  Rodriguez redems himself for the hilariously bad ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO. The hard-ass saving the dirty angel theme runs throughout the film but doesn't get old<br /><br />or stale, the violence is over the top and splendidly brutal, and the gore and T&A is aplenty, pleasing the heck out of a depraved maniac like me.<br /><br />This film gets stars all across the board from me. Although the casting of that  bland bloke Clive in the hooker showdown tale was a bad move, and although Bruce Willis plays an old man and yet nobody thinks to slap some old man make-up on him (even when he ages during the course of the film), the movie over-all is stunningly good and Miller's brillance was wonderfuly transported from the page to the screen.<br /><br />The real stroke of genius here was letting Frank Miller co-direct the movie. Rodriguez (and Tarantino, somewhere) aided with the techincal and camera direction aspect  but Miller repainted the mood of his graphic novels. This is why it came out so  good, unlike the bastardized versions of comics which hit theaters without consultation<br /><br />of the original creators (doody-tanks like THE PUNISHER and THE HULK). Rami did great on the SPIDER-MAN films because he was such a hardcore fanboy, but normally such dedication to the original artisty isn't present and directors think they have ways to improve the original story, and then they, in the end, ruin them.<br /><br />BATMAN BEGINS was originaly based on Frank Miller's BATMAN: YEAR ONE. While BATMAN BEGINS still looks to have some promise, it likely would have been better if they had worked with Miller on it. Miller was one of the best things to ever happen to Batman. We'll see if Christian Bale cuts the mustard or if he simply cuts the cheese.<br /><br />So far, I have mixed feelings about it. It looks good overall, but Bale looks so much like Kilmer in the suit. This seems like a bad omen. Don't get me wrong, I like Bale. AMERICAN PSYCHO was great! But<br /><br />Bale as Batman? I don't know about that.<br /><br />Anyway, SIN CITY was the best movie I've seen in a very, very long time. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys crime, noir, horror and overall fun movies.",Sin City
5301646,B004SIPA0A, ANBQIWHO9JRFS,5.0, Pure Entertainment,"Even moreso than usual, I have nothing to tell you about this movie that hasn't been said a million times before.  Still, some things are cool enough that you've gotta take the time to recommend them no matter what.  As I said in my title, this film is pure entertainment, from beginning to end.  It virtually never lets up, and has the visual innovation, technical brilliance and sheer oddness to make feel like it could've gone on for a whole lot longer without getting old.<br /><br />As others have said, this is perhaps the ultimate 'guy film', and it's delightfully violent and perverse without either becoming to grim or seeming like it is solely meant to shock.  Plenty of people are offended by the violence, though it's tough to imagine why considering how over the top most of it is.  Also, others have accused it of being sexist as the majority of the women are in the film are prostitutes and scantily clad. (You'd think the fact that all the men in the movie are killers and criminals and slimebags would offset this and make it merely misanthropic, or perhas *gasp* a sheer piece of absurd fantasy with no real connection to reality, but apparently not)  I find both these causes for offense to be utterly ridiculous, but it is relevant to the certain groups.  So prudes and humorless feminists: Beware! You won't wanna see this movie.  Or, maybe you will, as getting offended seems to be the primary pleasure of those two groups.  But whatever, the people who do wanna see this movie know who they are, and they'll like it.<br /><br />As everyone knows, this movie is divided into 3 major sections.  I like this pattern, as only having a couple relatively brief segments means that things have to get going fast, and that the film has numerous peaks.  Everyone loves to compare this to `Pulp Fiction' though this isn't totally relevant, as though the segments cross over and reference each other, they all stand alone and don't really illuminate each other all that much.  The internal references are just kinda... cool, but they aren't really all that important.  Though there is a slight concern: The segments proceed in decreasing order of quality, so the best parts of the movie are at the beginning.  Still, it's all good enough that this doesn't matter all that much.<br /><br />Most people love to talk about the black and white with occasionally bits of color as the major trait of the film, but I think some of the other stylistic quirks are more unusual and intriguing.  The dialogue and acting are deliberately over the top, a slight caricature of you're stereotypical noir dialogue and mannerisms, which combines with some nearly perpetual voice overs from the primary characters, and lots of sleazy music to complete the noir feel.  The overblown noir stylization is combined with some really bizarre and of the wall characters, such as the scrawny-mute-superhuman-cannibal-serial-killer-farmboy, the misshapen-yellow-pedophile-mancreature and the deadly-asian-ninja-prostitute.  This is all pretty weird, naturally, but it never gets so unusal that it can't be taken seriously.<br /><br />The film also really illustrates the potential of digital filming, as the backgrounds and scenery are combined with the actors seamlessly.  The world doesn't look real, exactly, but, of course, it's not really meant to, and there's never any doubt that the actors are there.<br /><br />Despite the emphasis on style, and over the top violence and action, the film has a certain emotional resonance.  It may all be absurd, but Marv and Hartigan are still genuinely likable, sympathetic characters.  Dwight is less compelling, but he's still pretty, well, cool, and that's pretty good too.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  The core-audience for this film will almost certainly like it, and have doubtless already seen it.  Everyone else... I dunno.  But I sure like it.",Sin City

I have to say that it was very well put together visually and the many stories were scripted well to make the story cohesive.  I liked it very much.  I love all the characters even the Eric Stahl character. It was very good it showed a different side of top notch actors that some avid movie goers have not seen, this was fabulous.  It was well scripted and well directed it was true to the title and the graphic novel.  This was good work Robert and Quentin, but that is to be expected with these two directors, bravo.

5301649,B004SIPA0A, A2DC81S17I9NEZ,5.0, First True Comic Adaption,"Finally, they finally get it. This is the first time that a director has accepted the brilliance of a comic (graphic novel) at face value and attempted to bring it to a larger audience by adapting it for the big screen. Hopefully the success of this film will be a cue to movie makers everywhere that making comic book adoptions goes way beyond using licensed character names and state of the art CGI. Sin City the film is brilliant because Sin City the graphic novel series is brilliant (Not to take anything away from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarintino's direction). The movie does an excellent job capturing the characters, setting, plot and overall mood and style of the novels. Like the novels, this movie is not for those who are easily offended by scenes of graphic violence. But like so many other Tarintino and Rodriguez movies Sin City is a world all its own and should not be viewed through a realistic lens. For those looking for a true adoption of a dark comic Sin City is for you, for those looking for Spiderman 3 might want to skip this one. It's just not that kind of movie.",Sin City
5301650,B004SIPA0A, A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,5.0, ORIGINAL and THRILLING!!,"First and foremost, SIN CITY is a treat for the eyes.  There's never been a movie that looks quite like this one.  It was filmed largely in front of green-screen sets, much like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  Unlike that dreary movie, which tried to make us believe the ""sets"" were real, SIN CITY tries to make us believe the entire movie is a comic book that's been animated.  It attempts a lot technically, and ACHIEVES it.  There are a few moments in the movie (the shot of Bruce Willis leaving prison, with snow coming down on him, for example) that are beautiful, pure and simple.  Others are whimsical.  Others give us vertiginous angles that wouldn't be possible in ""real life.""  The movie is worth a look just for the technical aspects.<br /><br />I've never read anything by Frank Miller.  I'm not a graphic novel reader.  But I am a fan of film noir, and what I loved about this movie was the way it melded ""old style"" film noir narration (a la the books of Dashiel Hammett or Raymond Chandler) with a modern sensibility.  The movie is also ultra-violent, but if you read something like RED HARVEST by Hammett, written in the 1920's, you see that streets running red with blood is hardly a new thing.<br /><br />The movie tells three (OK, four) loosely interweaving stories that are set in this metropolis that is utterly corrupt.  No one ""normal"" even seems to live there...it's populated entirely by corrupt cops, killers, strippers, hookers and psychopaths.  Some of them have hearts of gold, or at least, hearts that aren't totally black, and these are our heroes.  I don't want to delve into the details of each story, but I found them all fascinating, although the first major story, with Mickey Rourke as the disfigured tough Marv may have been my favorite.  I felt it most cleanly walked the line between humor, pathos and suspense.  His character was an original.<br /><br />Nearly everyone in the movie was terrific.  You can tell they were energized by taking part in Robert Rodriquez's little experiment.  Mickey Rourke was outstanding...too bad no one will recognize him, because this could be his comeback vehicle.  Clive Owen (whom I've always found a bit hard to warm up to) was very good...tough, vulnerable, funny.  Bruce Willis does his patented world-weary cop, but there's a reason he keeps getting parts like that...he's darn good in them.  Benicio Del Toro clearly had fun with his creepy role.  Elijah Wood, while not really called upon to ""perform"", certainly shatters his ""good hobbit"" image in this flick!<br /><br />The women don't fare quite so well.  The parts are somewhat underwritten and incidental.  Jessica Alba is the most important female character, and while she looks the part, her acting talents aren't totally up to snuff.  Not enough to make one cringe, but there could have been more depth.  Rosario Dawson really chomps into her role...she fares best among the women.  Alexis Bleidl is OK and Brittany Murphy overacts mightily. I know many will find the movie to be anti-woman.  True, women aren't portrayed in too great a light here...but you know what?  Men aren't either.  These people are all just shades of scum...some scummier than others.  But the women are also strong and can ""take care of themselves.""  So, if you want to argue the movie glorifies violence...that's one thing.  But hates women?  That's a non-starter for me.<br /><br />But this movie, primarily, is a feast for the senses.  A great overall visual look (Visual Effects supervisor:  Robert Rodriquez), great editing (Rodriquez) and camera work (Rodriquez).  Good musical score (co-composed by Rodriquez) and great sound work.  It's a dizzyingly fast-paced movie that never feels hurried.  There's always something fun to listen to or to see.<br /><br />It is VERY violent.  If you were turned off by KILL BILL,  you might be equally appalled by the violence here.  Absolutely not for little kids.  But if you want a visceral  treat, this is a MUST SEE movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and am ready to see it again!",Sin City

I didn't hear one person say anything bad about it. Even my manager, who is supposed to be staying by the phones in case anyone calls, came in to watch the movie.

5301661,B004SIPA0A, A37S3ACL57LN62,5.0, Sin City Breaks Rules,"When the movie title appears, the lighting becomes dim and the audience receives its first glimpse of the evil portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />Frank Miller's Sin City is highly stylized and very violent. It is based on a graphic novel, but is also reminiscent of film noir of the 1940s and 50s. This is evident in the use of voice-overs, crime and the personalities of the characters. The extreme loyalty of the film to the novel is refreshing after so many disappointing adaptations such as The Hulk and Daredevil.<br /><br />The film was praised for staying true to its roots. The novel was often superimposed into shots of the film to make the two as identical as possible.<br /><br />The characters are stereotypical representations of what one might expect from a bad neighborhood. All of the men are murderers, even the police. There are good guys and corrupt ones and their clashes result in death most of the time. The women are strippers or prostitutes who use violence to take care of themselves or who utilize their men to do the dirty work for them. The cast is exceptional with stars such as Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood, Benicio Del Toro and Nick Stahl. The characters are highly controversial and they hardly depict role models which is cause for some to question why such famous actors would want to be part of such a project. Director Robert Rodriguez said, ""Actors want to create memorable characters; they don't want to play themselves in movies over and over again.""<br /><br />The story itself is presented in layers. There is a short story with Josh Hartnett that acts as the very beginning and the end of the film. It is based on the short ""The Customer is Always Right"" and was created as a vehicle to sell the film to producers. The compelling story starring Bruce Willis ends and returns again after the two center stories. It is based on the short ""That Yellow Bastard."" There are two middle stories that only have one segment each. One called ""The Hard Goodbye"" stars Mickey Rourke as a Hulk-like do-gooder that constantly faces trouble. A second non-returning segment stars Clive Owen and is based on the short ""The Big Fat Kill."" Each story revolves around a man's love for a woman.<br /><br />Rodriguez was ejected from the Screen Actor's Guild for breaking one of the rules with Sin City, working with one or more co-directors.<br /><br />Quentin Tarentino appeared as a guest director and was paid only one dollar for his contribution. The style of the film is reminiscent of Tarentino's own work. The chronological structure of the film is similar to that in Pulp Fiction. There is even a homage to Reservoir Dogs when a man's ear is shot clean off. Tarentino's own fame has brought conflicting ideas about which scene he directed. The general consensus seems to be that he probably directed a relatively unimportant scene.<br /><br />This film is not for the weak at heart nor is it for women who easily get offended by films that might seem to degrade them on the surface. This film contains violence and female nudity. The nudity is not excessive and makes the film realistic.<br /><br />Violence is the most obvious element. It is so abundant that the film almost received a harsher rating than the R rating it received. The visual effects aid this dilemma. They make the amount of blood and the severity of the violence less intense. Some might say that the extremity of the violence is used to generate publicity. Male genitals are attacked several times throughout the film and cannibalism is an addressed issue. Each of these adds to the shock value. The film has been scrutinized by some for being too violent, but creator Frank Miller said, ""Chuck Jones got criticism for violence!"" referring to the creator of Wile E. Coyote.<br /><br />The visual effects were so unrealistic, they had to be done on a green screen. The film was shot in color and was later changed to stark black and white through a digital process.<br /><br />USA Today outlined the seven cardinal rules of movie-making that Sin City broke. These rules included never making black and white movies, never using voice-overs, never having blatant sexuality in a comic book movie, never using several directors, never making beautiful actors uglier, never excluding famous actors from having dialogue and never relying on green screens for the bulk of a film.<br /><br />Overall, Sin City seems to be a hit or a flop with people with no one in between. The sexuality, violence, and unusual film-making are certainly refreshing elements even if they shock instead of thrill.",Sin City
5301662,B004SIPA0A, A19Y4W9RZDRNF4,4.0," ""Kill him, Marv - kill him good!""","The first thing to be said for `Sin City' is that it is unique and fresh. After sitting through a half hour of trailers for upcoming flicks that were mostly rehashed remakes of old movies without an ounce of originality or risk taking in them, this was immediately obvious. Though it makes use of conventions from the film noir tradition, they are all given new life and a fresh look in this stylized, highly original live action graphic novel of a movie.<br />Sin City is a place where the cops are so crooked, the politicians so evil, the tough guys and the prostitutes so hard boiled that Philip Marlow's Los Angeles looks like Mayberry in comparison. Its violence is so far over the top and sadistic as to make Pulp Fiction look like Saturday morning kiddy fare. The only significant difference between Sin City's heroes and villains seems to be a sense of honor that the heroes feel toward women - otherwise it is often hard to tell them apart.<br />  Three overlapping and loosely interrelated stories are presented, and Quentin Tarantino fans will recognize his style in the non sequential way in which they are told. Bruce Willis makes a strong showing playing the archetypical ""last honest cop"" whose sense of honor leads him into a world of hell on his last day on the job. But it is Mickey Rourke who steals the show as Marv; a Charles Bukowski meets the Terminator kind of guy who is the avenging angel of a murdered prostitute who showed him kindness.<br />Sin City may look film noir in its style, but its universe is pure super hero comic book. Characters routinely take punishment that no human could survive. Rourke's character is twice hit by a speeding car and just shakes it off, and is struck full force on the head with a sledge hammer which only momentarily knocks him out. This comic book resilience together with an intentional corniness in the dialogue makes for a strange, disconcerting juxtaposition with the sadistic ultra violence of the film.<br />Without a doubt, Sin City is pushing the cultural envelop further yet in testing just how much evil and violence we will tolerate in our entertainment. I must confess to feeling uneasy while watching it - it felt like the moral equivalent of watching a bull fight, or even a gladiatorial death match. I give it five stars for its style and creativity, but subtract one for the ethical ambiguity that I feel toward it. I would strongly caution that you should take your own ethics about violence as entertainment into consideration when choosing whether or not to view this disturbingly entertaining movie.<br /><br />Theo Logos",Sin City
5301663,B004SIPA0A, A14QAT1XDSCLEO,4.0, The Virtue in Sin City,"The Ultimate ""Non-Chick Flick""<br /><br />Whether you like it or whether you don't, if you like movies, you ""must see"" this film. Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. From this movie on, there are only two credible, if widely divergent, paths to take in bringing a comic book concept to the screen: ""Spiderman 2"", or ""Sin City"". One can make a movie as earnestly, beautifully real, full of genuine human feeling, and as lovingly put on screen as ""literal truth"" as ""Spiderman 2"", or one can make a movie as stunningly surreal and hyperbolically drawn as ""Sin City"", but most other attempts will seem poor pretenders. Not to belittle the critic's darling ""American Splendor"", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after ""Frank Miller's Sin City"". This movie will be as influential on future movie-making as the original ""Star Wars"" was in its day.<br /><br />Visually, cinematographically, the movie is genius. If you've seen the trailers, you knew that something new and excitingly ""awe-ful"" (no, I don't mean ""awesome"") was coming. And once you've seen the movie, it is amazingly hard to get the film noir images out of your head.<br /><br />The cast list is incredible: from Josh Hartnett in the opening sequence to Bruce Willis's exposition of the back story, to Mickey Rourke as ""Marv"", then to the smoking hot Clive Owen as ""Dwight"", this is a man's movie. I haven't even mentioned Elijah Wood in a role that will forever keep him from being typecast as a lovable hobbit, Benecio Del Toro, who quite literaly metamorphoses into a ""dirty cop"" on screen, Michael Madsen and Nick Stahl. Testosterone and adolescent male fantasies drive this convoluted tale of urban corruption. In fact, experiencing this movie is a bit like being inside the adolescent male mind in a dream-like state.<br /><br />It does bother me that we haven't yet grown out of this teenaged vision of violence, but nowhere else is it so satirically, so poetically translated onto screen. As virtually ""bloody"" as this movie is, and as much as I say I abhor violence, I was laughing with the young male audience at the violent hyperbole which permeates the story. I am also bothered by the obvious male fantasy that all women (in the movie, of course) are hookers or strippers, all at least half-naked or wearing thongs and fishnet stockings.  ""All women"",  except for an eleven-year old girl-- almost a rape victim--,  who grows up to be Jessica Alba the stripper. Most are victims, and even Rosario Dawson, playing strong-- even dominatrix, has to wait for Clive Owen to show up to rescue her. This is one movie that makes me almost thankful for ""political correctness"" outside the theater.<br /><br />But if you have a mind to suspend disbelief, and live for 126 minutes in Frank Miller's graphic world, choose Mickey Rourke for the ride. His features are modified to look even more ""comic book"" than the more recognizable Willis or Owen, but he is so completely Marv that he blows us away when he's blowing away the bad guys (OK, the worse guys). Mickey Rourke is the hard act to follow in this film. He is too much. He is over the top. But he carries us over the top with him, like King Kong with Faye Wray.<br /><br />""Hardboiled"" is a wishy-washy, weak-kneed way to describe the spectacularly and terrifyingly gender-driven bloodlust that fuels the film. All of the ""heroes"" are more than flawed, but they are all violent, and both welcome and expect it toward themselves in the same way they dish it out.<br /><br />Someday, I dream, Tarantino and Rodriguez will put their genius at film as medium in the service of a philosophical idea that they recognize as bigger than themselves. They have perfected stylistized violence; they have sniggered and winked and done the secret handshake about guns, and knives, and beating each other to a pulp, and rape, and how all of this adds up to some masculine heroic ideal. I cannot even imagine how wonderful, how superb, how phenomenal that film might be, if they were to grow up, explore the universe a little bit more, and take us with them. A-",Sin City
5301664,B004SIPA0A, A96K1ZGW56S2I,4.0, Welcome to Basin City.,"After extolling his nihilistic tendancies through his magnum opus comic, BATMAN: THE DARK NIGHT RETURNS and the screenplays for ROBOCOP 2 & 3, Frank Miller returned to his comic book roots and modified his pessimistic worldview by writing a series of extremely gritty, largely black & white graphic novels that came to be known as part of the Sin City series. Miller hasn't had very many positive experiences with the Hollywood system and for the longest time swore he would never allow the Sin City books to be transformed into a movie.<br /><br />Then Robert Rodriquez entered the picture. Despite the fact that he shoots most of his films in his studio near his Southwestern home (in Texas I believe) and is a filmmaking maverick who not only directs his films, but usually writes, edits, and scores them as well; Rodriquez has established himself as a powerful Hollywood filmmaker. Rodriquez has been a fan of Miller's Sin City books from their first publication and secretly shot a short based on one of the stories as test to show to Miller. Rodriquez showed the short to Miller, Miller loved it and the short became the opening sequence to SIN CITY.<br /><br />SIN CITY is one of the most brutal crime noir films ever to be made. The movie tells a series of three and a half different tales that are loosely connected that take place in Basin City. Basin City is sort of an overly corrupt, crime-invested version of NYC. Things are so bad that grafitti artists have spray-painted over the ""Ba"" in the town's sign, thus the name ""Sin City.""<br /><br />Rodriquez used Miller's comics as the storyboards for the movie. Therefore, SIN CITY is filmed mostly in black and white with only the occasional dash of color: a red dress, a blue hot rod, a yellow deformed man, blond hair. Also, there is a bar in Sin City that virtually all the main characters in the movie have an association with. Sometimes in this bar things seem to lighten up and the cold black & white world outside is allowed to be tainted with a tinge of colors in their softest hues.<br /><br />The casting for SIN CITY is brilliant and all of the actors do a good job for their roles. The most exceptional performance is pulled off by Mickey Rourke who plays Marv. Marv's story is perhaps the most optimistic of the tales, even though it does include a beheading, cannibalism, and an execution.<br /><br />SIN CITY is an incredibly violent film and had it been shot in color would have probably received an NC-17 rating. There's all kinds of shootings and stabbings, several explosions, cannibalism, two beheadings, a castration, an attempted child rape, suicide, and other acts of violence I can't recall. Staying true to the color-style of the film, whenever someone bleeds, their blood is usually yellow or white, but never red.<br /><br />Depressing as the movie is, I have to admit that I did enjoy parts of the film.  I was rooting for Marv and hoping he would at least win the girl, if not the day. I was impressed by the cinematography. I liked the score. However, reflecting upon the movie later on, I was almost sick to my stomach.  Technically and cinematographically, the film is brilliant.  But as far as stories go, SIN CITY is true to its title and wallows in sin & filth; making it one of the bleakest films I have ever seen. It's definitely not a movie that everyone will enjoy, and even some who do (like myself) will discover later that it--like sin-really wasn't that great of an experience after all.",Sin City
5301665,B004SIPA0A, A205NEEKCQY4F8,4.0, Has recut and theatrical versions,"""Sin City"" is now on Blu-ray on two discs. One disc has the ""Recut"" version which adds about 6 minutes of story content, and also presents each story as a separate feature. There's not a big difference between this and the theatrical version. I think the theatrical version flows nicer, because it blends the stories together, so I recommend that for a first viewing. I enjoyed watching the ""recut"" version as a second viewing, because it's changed just enough to keep it feeling fresh, like listening to a favorite CD on shuffle.",Sin City
5301666,B004SIPA0A, A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ,5.0," Sinful ""City""","The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. ""Sin City"" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes ""Sin City,"" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike ""Sky Captain,"" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three ""Sin City"" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is not quite a ""Kill Bill"" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. ""Sin City"" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. An outstanding piece of work.",Sin City
5301667,B004SIPA0A, A8KISUT7RB2OX,5.0, One of the best comic book movies ever,"The negative review below that gripes about it being a ""comic book style"" movie is indicitive of the typical ignorance of the naysayers of this film.  Of course it's a comic book style, it's a comic book movie.  Comic book and film noir, two of the cheesiest styles ever.  And no story?  I can only assume that the people that say this are too busy playing games on their cell phones instead of paying attention to the film.  There are 3 very distinct stories, all of them told in a spectacular fashion with stellar acting.<br /><br />This film is a beautiful transfer from Frank Miller's graphic novels.  You can look at the panels of the graphic novels and see the exact scenes from the movie.  As mentioned in the editorial review, the only real change is the lessening of nudity in the film.  No big loss, although every red-blooded male wishes that Jessica Alba had done the topless scene.<br /><br />Buy this movie and, while you're at it, get the 3 graphic novels it's based on:  Sin City: The Hard Goodbye, Sin City: The Big Fat Kill, and Sin City: That Yellow Bastard.  While you're at it, pick up Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and get the backstory on Dwight and the girls of Old Town.",Sin City
5301668,B004SIPA0A, A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,5.0, Pulp Fiction Influenced Excellent Frank Miller Adaptation Makes For the Best Film I've Seen In Years!,"I've always been a big fan of Frank Miller ever since I first read <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIKZEG"">Batman the Dark Knight Returns #1 First Print</a> which I thought then and I still think now is the best comic book about The Batman ever written.  I never read ""Sin City"" and so I watched this without knowing anything about it prior and after having been jaded with really mediocre film offerings over recent years I really wasn't expecting much and so I was blown away with just how good this film is.  It was like watching a comic book come alive and just like my favourite comic book mentioned earlier I really enjoyed this great piece of writing by Frank Miller.  The film reminded me a lot of another great film <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006BSBW"">Pulp Fiction</a> and I guess with the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino as ""guest director"" this shouldn't surprise me but using the same tactic of merging apparently different storylines really works here unlike elsewhere like in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V38"">Chungking Express</a> where it really didn't work as well.  Although some have tried and doubtless many more will try in the future this almost new genre of graphic novel films has a new standard upon which others will be measured and this film is it.  Great storytelling, great acting and as far as this dvd goes excellent picture and DTS 5.1 surround sound quality makes this just a great film to watch over and over again like any classic film should be.<br /><br />My great wish now is for the same directors to do an even better job if possible on a similar film version of my favourite graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"".  ""Sin City"" for now though is one of the best films that I've watched in many many years and this dvd is also among the best both picture and sound quality-wise that I've seen on a non-Blu-ray format.<br /><br />Highly recommended!",Sin City

It is one of the best movies you will possibly see and is amongst the best graphic novel based movies you will probably ever experiance.  The movie pays tribute to the great film Noir genre, throughout the movie, the director utilizes a series of predominantly black an white color palates while using color only for specific ""popping"" effect.<br /><br />This movie has a wonderful gritty, deep, feel that perfectly portrays the dark underworld that it is narrating.  The cast in the movie is phenominal, and the acting is amazing.  This movie has the best of all possible worlds in movie making.. it has violence, a deep story line, sex, and action that keeps you wanting more and more.  The beginning scene of the movie leave you begging for more, the end scene leaves you stunned and the middle is just unbelievably amazing.<br /><br />I have never read the graphic novel, seeing this movie certainly pushed me to go out and get it.  I absolutely loved this movie, and you will too, it is phenominal.. no plotholes here!  GO AND GET IT!!<br /><br />Just a note if you can get the unrated collector's edition.  Appearantly movie companies think that people want an edited, censored version.. WTF, I hate when movies are censored and edited so they can make the R cut.. Just give us the unedited movie to begin with with a choice in teh menu for the edited version.. But no, they feel the need to double dip and make double profit off you...

What makes this movie so unique is that it is made in High quality Black and White with some colorization on certain portion of the scene giving it a polished look.

5301676,B004SIPA0A, A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,5.0, this sure as bloody hell ain't vegas . . .,"You can't but admire Robert Rodriguez for achieving his vision of bringing Frankie Miller's graphic novel Sin City, to the big screen.  The result of his dedication and vision, is a stylistic, visually striking, technically impressive, near perfect homage, to Miller's world of crime, violence, romance, revenge, women, and vice.  Miller had no plans for a Sin City film, but when Rodriguez demonstrated to him what the film could be, Miller got onboard the project as a co-director.  Using the graphic novels as the source, Rodriguez clearly envisioned technically how the film could be made, and transformed that concept into a reality that even exceeded the expectations of Frankie Miller, authentically capturing the look, style and atmosphere of Sin City.<br /><br />Another major contributor to the film's success is its amazing cast.  From top to bottom, Rodriguez enlisted a parade of top flight talent that is quite unique.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Torro, Jaime King, Carla Gugino, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, and Elijah Wood, head what is one of the more remarkable casts in a film of this decade, one that also includes Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Josh Harnett and Marlee Shelton in minor roles.<br /><br />Presented predominantly in black and white, the original version of Sin City cleverly blends several stories together in a fashion that holds together pretty cohesively, although the tonality of The Big Fat Kill incorporates a  bit more humor than the rest.  The performances are all strong, particularly considering the challenges of acting against a sterile green screen.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke, both rise to the top with gritty, powerful, and emotional performances.<br /><br />There are a ton of extras in this edition, including several commentaries, and numerous featurettes covering various facets of the production.  Lots of cool secrets are revealed in 'Fifteen Minute Film School with Robert Rodriguez'.  Shooting against a green screen, enabled scenic elements to be inserted in post production.  The extent to which this cool technique was employed, can be seen in 'The All Green Screen Version'.  There is also a short documentary about how Frankie Miller was convinced to greenlight and join the production.<br /><br />The film has been recut, with some additional footage added, into the four separate stories, The Customer is Always Right, That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye, and The Big Fat Kill.  They appear on Disc 2, and can be viewed in any order.  Also included is a copy of The Hard Goodbye graphic novel.  The recut, extended version (DVD or Blu Ray), costs more, but if you enjoy Sin City, this is certainly the one to get.<br /><br />Amazon should revise their policy of regarding different versions of the same movie as being equivalent.  This two disc recut version, not the same as the regular edition single disc release.  This situation widespread, and leads to confusion for those seeking specific information about what special features and extras may be included in any particular edition.

The disc winds up with ""15 minute Flic School"" , ""Sin City: Live in Concert"", ""10 minute Cooking School"", ""The Long Take"" and an ""All Green Screen Version"". The last featurette shows how the film looked when they were shooting on the set running at ""800 times"" the normal speed accompanied by Rodriguez's score.

5301692,B004SIPA0A, A1T3O2LILVK0C4,4.0, A Grim and Gritty Modern Noir,"WARNING: This film contains graphic stylized violence including torture, as well as sexuality/nudity, coarse language, and disturbing themes.<br /><br />Only a sick and twisted mind could conceive of the warped stories that are found in the graphic novel series Sin City. Frank Miller is just such a mind. His morbid fascinations with corrupt authority figures, hypocritical religions, sleazy yet strong-willed women, and violent anti-heroes are thrust into the spotlight in his work. With his comic books and graphic novels, we are given a disturbing glimpse into his worldview. His characters are tainted with cynicism, darkened by madness, haunted by guilt, plagued by lust, and drenched in blood. Naturally his stories have been a commercial success despite their controversial subject matter, so it's no surprise that Hollywood producers, directors, and writers have sought to adapt them into films. This is something Frank Miller has always been reluctant to allow... up until now that is. Filmmakers and friends, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino unite their perverse adolescent minds and together they bring Frank Miller's Sin City to vivid life in a stark and oppressing film, which will leave its viewers desiring a thorough shower in order to wash away the residue of the film's immoral characters.<br /><br />Basin City, better known to its inhabitants as Sin City, is a shady underworld of crime and corruption. It's a place where crooked cops patrol the streets, where serial killers and sex offenders go free, where the church buries its own sins, and the noblest men are psychotic vigilantes. In this dog-eat-dog environment, only the strong survive and the pressures and strain of survival fracture the human psyche. No one is innocent, no one is pure and even Sin City's most charismatic denizens are scum. In this world diversion takes the form of strip bars and brothels, evil hides behind the mask of propriety, and revenge and redemption are the same.<br />The film is divided into three stories. They are:<br />1. Detective Hartigan has been tracking down a powerful senator's son, who kidnaps, rapes, and murders young girls. Hartigan is betrayed by another cop, his partner in fact, who is under the pay of the senator. Hartigan takes the fall for the senator's son only to protect one of the intended victims. Years later he is let out of jail and tries to save that same girl from the senator's wrath, but she has become a stripper and fallen in love with Hartigan, the man who once saved her. Soon Hartigan realizes that he was part of a plan to bring her out into the open where the senator's son can carry out his wicked desires.<br />2. Dwight is an enigmatic criminal with a soft spot for damsels in distress. When his new girlfriend is beaten up by her abusive ex, Dwight plans to teach him a lesson. Dwight chases him into the red light district where a band of vigilante prostitutes kills him, only to discover that he was a cop with a destructive ego. Now Dwight and the prostitutes must fend off corrupt officials and the mob in order to keep their territory to themselves.<br />3. Meanwhile Marv, a deformed schizophrenic brute, seeks bloody retribution after the woman he slept with is killed and he's framed for the murder. In his attempt to solve the mystery of her death and avenge her, he discovers a plot that leads to one of the city's most powerful families, corruption within the government, police force, and the church. He pulls off his brutal revenge but he ultimately pays the price in the end.<br />These three tales interlock like pieces to a sinister puzzle, each piece bringing the audience closer to the story's completion, showing us the seedy underbelly of Basin City from multiple perspectives.<br /><br />Much like Pulp Fiction in its fragmented narrative, Sin City unfolds out of chronological order, which is perhaps the film's greatest flaw. However the film is boosted by the dramatic visual style of Miller, Rodriguez, and Tarantino who imbue it with the atmosphere of a 1940s noir film and the savage violence of 1970s action cinema. Most of the movie was shot against a green screen and then CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) artists created the surrounding environments. This made it possible for the filmmakers to replicate Frank Miller's graphic style; the high contrast black and white metropolis, the inverted shadows cast upon brick walls, the saturated red of blood splatters, and the golden yellow of a vixen's hair.<br />The morally ambivalent characters are brought to life by a talented ensemble cast including Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Alexis Bledel, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Carla Gugino, Josh Hartnett, Rutger Hauer, Jaime King, Michael Madsen, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Marley Shelton, Nick Stahl, Bruce Willis, and Elijah Wood.<br />The film won't appeal to everyone. It's gratuitous depictions of violence and sex are proof of that. However, if taken with a grain of salt, Sin City is an entertainingly over-the-top exploitation masterpiece that faithfully recreates Frank Miller's imaginative graphic novels.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593963149"">Frank Miller's Complete Sin City Library</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000244F2S"">Film Noir Classic Collection, Vol. 1</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHQTE"">Dirty Harry Ultimate Collector's Edition</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HC2LEY"">Reservoir Dogs</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068DBC"">Pulp Fiction</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMEW"">Kill Bill Vol. 1</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMUA"">Kill Bill Vol. 2</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZTY"">El Mariachi</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A2ZU1"">Desperado</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000WN140"">Once Upon a Time in Mexico</a>",Sin City

5301695,B004SIPA0A, A145EDBZDAYY7L,5.0," Original, exciting and unbelievably entertaining","Sin City, based on Frank Miller's successful series of comic books of the same name is an intense thrill ride from start to finish. The film was directed by Miller himself as well as Robert Rodriguez, along with Quentin Tarantino, who directed a small segment of the final cut.<br /><br />The ensemble cast is tremendous and includes (among others): Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer.<br /><br />The stories of the various different characters and the consequences their actions have on their counterparts are ingeniously interweaved to form a narrative that is constantly moving at break neck speed.<br /><br />The story begins with Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a detective of Sin City with one day left from retirement, in pursuit of a sick child killer. The ensuing events are violent, unexpected and exhilerating. After Hartigan's story has been told, Rodriguez and Miller move the action along to Marv, a man determined to find out who killed the girl of his dreams. This leads him to the girls of Old Town, the hookers who work the streets there, enforcing their own laws and looking after themselves. After a series of events leads to a possible war between the police and the prostitutes, action has to be taken by all of the characters to prevent it before it is too late. It is during the second half of the film that all of the characters' connections to one another become clear and the story trundles on towards its shocking conclusion.<br /><br />Usually a film featuring strippers, prostitutes, extreme violence and explosions would be considered ""bad taste"" cinema, but Sin City is so beautifully acted, shot and directed that it is an astounding masterpiece. The cast are all on top form and the production values are tremendous. Sin City is a must-see!<br /><br />The DVD extras are excellent, with the second disc featuring the extended director's cut of the film which only adds to the experience, and offer an insight into the creative process behind the film.",Sin City

5301703,B004SIPA0A, ANCOMAI0I7LVG,5.0, Picture book perfection; a film that stands out as unique and exciting...,"`Sin City' is a film you will either love or hate.  There is a lot going on and sometimes it gets hard to figure out who is doing what but if you slip into the mode that is `Sin City' is will all put itself together for you.  You just have to want to `get' this movie.  I wanted to `get' this movie, and you know what, I did, and with each and every watch through I `get' it even more.  The fact remains that Sin City is above and beyond brilliant film making.  It's visually stunning and completely captures the imagery that Frank Miller created with his graphic novels.  It's dark, gritty and aggressive; violent and seductive.  `Sin City' is an amalgam of everything that makes `sin' in general so grotesque.  In other words, it's the dark underbelly of a life all too often glamorized.<br /><br />`Sin City' takes three stories from the `Sin City' alumni and interweaves them throughout one another to create the appearance of one long story.  The three stories used (`The Hard Good-Bye', `The Big Fat Kill' & `That Yellow B*****') all feature some strong if not flawed characters that have a habit of making some very poor decisions.  What is strange though is that we form attachments to these characters despite their behavior and we find ourselves rooting for them in the long run.  You see, despite their flaws and transgressions they are victims themselves and warrant our support.<br /><br />The acting is spot on for the type of film that this is.  I've heard some friends talking about the cheesy dialog and the wooden acting but what they fail to realize is that this is a comic book adaptation and it takes that very literally.  Robert Rodriguez brilliantly crafted a world that is so similar to the one Miller created frame for frame it feels like reading a comic, like peering into Miller's graphic novels.  The acting thus corresponds with this vision.  The dialog is at times even word for word from the books, and the way the characters respond and or interact is classic comic exaggeration.  It all comes together to create the perfect backdrop for the film.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and especially Mickey Rourke nail their performances, adding depth to the film as a whole.  Jessica Alba actually pulls out her finest performance to date (who would have guessed it) and made me proud, and I think she's nothing more than a hard body so she took me by surprise.  Elijah Wood is effectively creepy, something I didn't think he had in him, and his character stayed with me long after the credits were rolled.  As a whole the performances are strong and are all memorable, Benicio Del Toro and Rosario Dawson coming to mind as key supporting players who make an impact.<br /><br />Yes, there are flaws to be found within `Sin City' but to me they are few and far in between.  I love what Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino were able to accomplish here and I eagerly await their efforts with `Sin City 2'.  If they are even half as successful with the second act I will be a happy man.  So just sit back and absorb the imagery for even if `Sin City' is not you cup of tea you can't help but admire the art that is set before you with each passing frame.",Sin City
5301704,B004SIPA0A, ADE9OU2OLWS3N,3.0, Heavy Metal-ish Film Noir?,"This was more violent and sadistic in content than I was prepared for, but that's probably a natural hazard when you're turning comic books into films.  The major weakness was that the individual stories were not adequately tied together at the end, and that reveals some weak scripting and a lack of immagination that otherwise flooded the screen.  The separate plots in, for example, Heavy Metal, were linked in a fashion that gave me a chill (or two).  Brilliant imagery, brilliant dialogue at times, and well packaged...but no chill.",Sin City

The cowboy bar dance marks a moment in pop culture--the cross roads of the stripper-friendly environment we all secretly endorse known as Las Vegas, and the ginormous media machine that is Madison Avenue advertising at its best. But I digress...<br /><br />At it's core, Sin City is sitting on top of the powerful thrumming engine that is film noire. Why seedy, caricature populated, punch to the jaw stories make us glad we lost our virginity before 18 is a total mystery, but they do. Sure it's uniquely colored, sure it's got an amazing cast, and sure this movie was scripted by the unholy hand of fate itself for Mickey Rourke, but it's appealing because it taps our fantasies--all of us.

The visual techniques are very impressive and make Sin City a film icon unto itself... it's not reality, nor any other movie you've seen, but occupies it's own niche as something black, white, and painted... something artistic.<br /><br />The plot follows a few short stories that all revolve around the main characters immediately getting knee deep in the dead. The characters narrate their own adventure with bleak, grim voices, which is a hit and miss technique. Women are portrayed very badly, as hookers and strippers almost exclusively, who rarely wear clothes.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked the ridiculous violence, stylized visuals that are actually not gimmicky, and atmosphere of the story telling.

The characters are processed and amped-up representations of their film noir archetypes, and the actors play their parts perfectly. Mickey Rourke's performance is undoubtedly the highlight, much to my surprise. The DVD is lacking in aspects such as special features, and I had trouble playing it in a certain DVD player of mine, but that might have been the fault of the (rather old) player. It worked fine in all other players I've tried, so this shouldn't be a deterrent from buying it. This is a great film and well worth owning for repeated viewings.

5301716,B004SIPA0A, A1N7YA81ZI4KAF,5.0, Breathtaking! And I'm Not Referring To Jessica Alba.,"Frank Miller's graphic comic-books come to breathtaking life in Robert Rodriguez's dazzling and extraordinarily violent film. ""Sin City"" centers around 3 engaging stories. The first involves Marv (brilliantly played by an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke), a messed up, ill-faced tough-guy on a quest to bring his lover's killer to justice. The other deals with the slick, Dwight (Clive Owen), an imposing, trench-coated charmer who unwittingly sets off a chain of unfortunate events by defending his smart-mouthed, physically abused girl-friend (Brittany Murphy). The final entry involves the tormented Willis and his love for a beautiful stripper (Jessica Alba) who he once rescued as a young girl from a heinous kidnapper and has to do so again when the monstrous villain returns with vengeance on his mind.<br /><br />This film looks splendid. The sets, costume design, cinematography and art direction are top-notch and I don't understand how this motion picture was not nominated for any ""Oscars"". The film is so visually breathtaking that the images and characters depicted will stay in your mind long after the closing credits. The entire film is shot in awesome black and white and every once and a while a dash of color is added enhancing the visual impact. There really isn't an action movie in recent memory that was this visually stimulating and artistically creative. Rodriguez successfully captures the essence of the comic-book characters without making them appear one-dimensional (It should be noted that Quentin Tarantino and Frank Miller are also given directing credits).<br /><br />""Sin City"" the comic books are not child's play so it's useless to expect the same from the film. The characters are all violent, impulsive and amoral individuals who kill without an ounce of remorse. The violence is graphic but the grisly gore scenes are executed so brilliantly that there really isn't that many moments in this film where the squeamish will be turning away or covering their eyes. They'll be too busy admiring the awesome beauty of the cast, the eye-catching visuals and the skill-fully choreographed fight scenes.<br /><br />Spectacle aside, the star-studded cast also deserves mention because they all give exceptional performances. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke are the stand-outs. Both actors are compelling to watch especially Rourke who commands our attention and makes the most out of his vicious but sympathetic character. And a review cannot be complete without mentioning the luminous Alba. That platinum hair, gorgeous figure and other-worldly presence makes a delightful Nancy Callahan. Other's in the impressive cast include Powers Booth, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Rutger Hauer, Josh Hartnett, Nick Stahl, Michael Madsen and Elijah Wood.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is a work of art. The luscious visuals, Miller's colorful characters, the film's bleak, desperate setting and Rodriguez's/Miller's/Tarantino's masterful direction all contribute into making this one of the best feature films of 2005. Set aside 2-plus hours and go along on this joy-ride. Chances are in your favor that you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",Sin City
5301717,B004SIPA0A, A3IBYRSA490ZOA,5.0, A Faithful Adaptation Of A Great Comic,"This DVD contains an interview with Frank Miller where he states that his reaction to the very idea of a `Sin City' movie was the same as mine, ""Sacrilege! This cannot be happening! Why does Hollywood want to destroy the name of another good comic book?""<br /><br />But `Sin City' is not a good comic book, it's the best there is. (A least in the genre of action.) I was very pleasantly proven wrong by `Sin City' the film. Frank Miller directs an amazing adaptation of his stories that is sure to please fans of the comic book, and normal people too.<br /><br />Why it works: The key reason why `Sin City' works is that it is amazingly faithful to the comic, almost word-for-word. I still remember those classic lines 13 years later. The film is an anthology of `Sin City's 3 best stories, the original `Sin City' from `DHP', `Sin City: The Big Fat Kill', and `Sin City: The Yellow Bastard'. The film is even faithful in that it contains surprisingly little profanity for an R rated action movie, because as fans know Miller rarely uses profanity. Really the only unfaithful thing is the absence of Miller's racial slurs.<br /><br />Well cast: The trailers boast an all-star cast of Hollywood's A list. While normally I sense dread with an ""all star cast"" as a sign of making up for a lack of good characters, here they were very well cast. Clive Owen probably stands out the best as Dwight (even though he can't shed his accent). I really felt the actors portrayed the characters of `Sin City' faithfully. And my fears that bigger stars' characters may be given larger roles was unfounded.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Just like the comic the film is non stop orgy of visually stunning eye candy. Making you say, ""Wow look at that!""<br /><br />My last fear was that the trailers boasted ""Directed by Robert Rodriguez."" Films directed by Robert Rodriguez are bad. Films that boast they are directed by Rodriguez are even worse. Let me calm your fears. Rodriguez clearly had no greater role in the production of this film than the bestboy. I'm sure that will anger Rodriguez's loyal fans but too bad. You can't tell me the director of `Spy Kids' made this masterpiece.<br /><br />It's good to see this film generating interest in the under valued medium of comic books. Normal people I know who wouldn't pick up a comic book if their lives depended on it are asking, ""Can I borrow the `Sin City' comics from you?""<br /><br />So in conclusion, whether you own every Frank Miller comic ever written or think `Sin City' is a computer video game, you will love this film for its great characters, intense plots, and dazzling eye candy.",Sin City

5301719,B004SIPA0A, A1PQLR0EN31PE8,5.0, Not what I expected,"For me, I like the intercut scenes from one story to the other.  I thought that was clever, but the new DVD have a version that seperates the story and it doesn't work for me.  Plus the additional minutes are miniscule at best.  They don't really add anything to the story and that is the biggest disappointment.  The cool thing about this DVD is all the extras and this is where this version far outshines the previous release one.  I think it's cool, compelling, especially the interviews with the filmmakers and the cast.<br /><br />The reason why I like the theater version over the re-edited version is that the theater version confuses you.  You never know whats is going to happen next and the filmmaker leaves it up to you to related all the stories together and in what time line they happened.  Luckily for us, the theater version is included on this DVD so if you do not own the movie (which most of us do), its a great buy.  If you do own the DVD then you have to ask yourself, do you want to get into the great extra features?  If you don't get into things like that, then don't buy it for the additional minute or so that each story gets.  Personally it's worth the price for the extras.",Sin City

It's hard to know exactly WHAT I wanted more of, since the film is suffused with style and violence, cheap broads with hearts of gold and mugs who never got a fair shot.<br /><br />But for all the style the film oozes, its extremely stylized dialogue is sometimes hard for the film's cast to get out and sound plausible doing so -- this is particularly true of some of the lines placed in the mouths of the actresses.<br /><br />Still, the film is ruthlessly true to Miller's vision and is easily the most hard-boiled noir movie ever made.

5301726,B004SIPA0A, A3P1A63Q8L32C5,5.0, Sin And The City,"When I first found out that Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novel series was going to be adapted for the big screen, I was both excited and concerned at the same time, at what could come out of it. The books were so unique, even for the comic book medium, that I knew they would be tough to adapt on film. When I saw the film's opening sequence in the theater  all of my concerns were put to rest, and I knew I was in for one heck of a ride. The end result is one of the most faithful films to its source material in the comic to movie genre ever made.<br /><br />Director Robert Rodriguez asked Miller himself to co-direct the film which loosely connects three of the series best stories. It leads off and ends though with a short vignette called The Customer Is Always Right, with Josh Hartnett as The Man. This helps to set the tone at the start, as well as put on a proper coda for the movie.<br /><br />The Hard Goodbye--Tortured tough guy Marv (Mickey Rourke) is framed for murder and he turns to his parole officer Luc (Carla Gugino) for help. Even as he forced to go it alone in the end. What he finds out is both unsettling and brilliant at the same time.<br /><br />The Big Fat Kill follows Dwight (Clive Owen) and what happens when he enters into a casual relationship with a waitress named Shellie (Brittany Murphy). Little does he know that he's about to put in the middle of a struggle for power over the red light district that forces him to do some wild things. During this segment of the film special guest director Quentin Tarantino was asked to helm a scene. While I am not a Tarantino fan by any means, I appreciate his work on this film, and his friendship with Rodriguez.<br /><br />That Yellow Bastard Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a rare honest cop in Sin City. Even as he prepares to retire, he will stop at nothing to put an end to a child molester's reign of terror, no matter how well connected the sewer rat might be. In order to have justice for the victims, Hartigan will sacrifice a lot, especially when his life becomes intertwined with victim Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba). When Hartigan's investigation takes him right to the vile Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl) himself, forcing him to discover just how far he's he's willing to go.<br /><br />Using green screen effects and CGI, Rodriguez was able to bring Sin City to life without really needing to tamper with the look and style of the books themselves. The results are dazzling. The true success though really has to do with Miller's characters and the way Rodriguez doesn't alter them to make them more Hollywood. The performances from the cast are first rate and help sell everything else. I have been critical of CGI/Green Screen flicks like Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow, whose characters let the film's tech look overtake it, but here, the tech acts to serve the characters--not vice versa. Like the books, the noir flavor shine through, while allowing for a dash of licence.<br /><br />Disc One includes the original theatrical cut of the film and these extras. A feature length audio commentary with Rodriguez and Miller, a second audio commentary with Rodriguez, Tarantino and Bruce Willis, and a third audio track featuring audience reaction at the premiere in Austin. The commentaries give you a well rounded look at how things came together, from both a creative standpoint and actor perspective. The reaction track is a hoot and worth a listen as you watch the film. There's also a series of featurettes on everything from Miller and Tarantino, to the film's cars, props, make-up effects and costumes. Some of the info from these can also be heard on the commentaries...that said they are worth watching. An interactive character time line and the theatrical trailers top off the disc.<br /><br />Disc Two includes an extended cut of each story--treating them more like separate short films---rather than a whole with a few connective threads. Some of the ""new"" footage is just incidental stuff. But there's some meaty additions in That Yellow Bastard and The Hard Goodbye that fans should like. Three more featurettes focus on how Rodriguez brought the film to life. Focusing on the CGI effects, a high-speed green screen only version of the movie, and a 14 minute uninterrupted take of the Tarantino scene. These are for die hard fans only. You'll also see what it was like at the wrap party with cast and crew. And wrapping up the second disc, you can learn how to make Sin City breakfast tacos (??!), yummmmm.<br /><br />The package also includes a paperback copy of The Hard Goodbye... Sin City is a great film, no matter which way you decide to watch it, and the 2 disc DVD is well worth it.",Sin City
5301727,B004SIPA0A, A1KDGSZEJXSE9S,4.0, really good,"Just one step below great... The visuals are awesome of course<br /><br />and so is the acting. Bruce Willis is a cop that just can't come<br /><br />to terms with the fact that he is aging and is just about out<br /><br />of the game.<br /><br />It's an action packed and gory thrill ride. Yes, it's a comic<br /><br />book thing, but you believe in the characters and they feel<br /><br />real. All three stories manage to keep your interested through<br /><br />out the entire two hours. Out of all the stories I'd say<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is my favorite as the beastly looking man out<br /><br />to get revenge for the men that killed his hooker girlfriend.<br /><br />It's rare to have a movie be really good eye candy and actually<br /><br />good at the sametime. Either a movie has a good story and lacks<br /><br />action, or it has good action and lacks any kind of story.<br /><br />Btw, Rosario Dawson is hot in this one!

5301729,B004SIPA0A, A3OUF25K7TOYIV,5.0, Darkside review of SIN CITY,"Review form the Darkside<br /><br />What I liked, plenty of violence. Chopped off heads, tons of gunshots, blown off hands, blown off heads, mucho sadistic torture, no mercy in the violence department. Stretched the R rating to the limit here.<br /><br />Hot women. I don't fricken know how but this little flick got away with totally turning women into horny sex slaves. Refreshing and very nice. I don't find empowered self-righteous chicks entertaining. All the babes looked totally wacka doo hot. You don't get any full frontal but you get a couple very perfect (almost too perfect) juicy melons. And fellas WOW some insanely perfect rear ends. I can't explain or put into words how flawless these buttocks where. But you'll know when you see the movie.<br /><br />The story was brutal, basically it's about well...sin. Bad people doing bad things. Mix in a couple cool dudes with consciences and a death wish for your two protagonists and you got the story.<br /><br />You get an all-star cast so the acting is all top notch. Even Brittney Murfy who I find creepy and freaky is very cool in Sin City. The dialog is clearly straight form the graphic novel so it seems unnatural at times but you get use to it and dig it after a while.<br /><br />The special effect and CGI are everywhere I love that shiz so I dug it and reveled in the lush artwork and city scrapes.<br /><br />The best character in this black and white fistfight of a movie was Marv played by Mickey Rourke. He was totally tough and likeable for a drunk, twisted, thug, loser, horny, smoke pipe, sadistic murderer. Kind of like John Travolta and Sam Jackson in pulp fiction when you first saw the movie, before they became played out and old.<br /><br />Sin City is very comic bookish, violent, sexy, and will have you glued to the screen for 2+hours and wishing it wouldn't end.<br /><br />I recommend it check it out.",Sin City

5301731,B004SIPA0A, A2B9WOSXCU7LDM,5.0, A Spectacular Modern Noir,"There has certainly been no shortage of comic book movies lately. From ""Spider-Man"" to ""X-Men"", for one reason or another, it just seems to be the current craze. Most of the films in this group are nothing but pointless Hollywood garbage full of drawn-out action sequences and cheesy dialogue. However, there are those select few that stand out. ""Sin City"" is one film does just about everything but get lost in the crowd.<br /><br />The film, based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, follows three stories. One is about Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a ""bum ticker"" on the verge of retirement who rescues a little girl from a rapist with political ties (Stahl); one is about Marv (Rourke), an odd-looking man searching for the killer of his ""true love"", Goldie (King), a prostitute who slept with him and ""was nice to him"" - something no other woman had ever done; and the other is about Dwight (Owen), a man who aids a group of prostitutes in the murder of several men, which sends Old Town (a city run by prostitutes) into a war. And this is all tied together by several elements, including a prostitute waitress (Murphy) and a cannibalistic serial killer (Wood).<br /><br />By now you've probably realized that ""Sin City"" isn't exactly a cookie-cutter PG-13 comic book movie, due to all the prostitutes, murder, and what-not. In fact, it's a violent pop-culture celebration, featuring one of the most remarkable casts in ages and being directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Frank Miller himself.<br /><br />The film's visual element is undeniably fantastic, as it remains strikingly faithful to Miller's graphic novels. Using a gorgeous mix of black and white and strategically placed color, the film creates an atmosphere reminiscent of the classic noir films of the '30s and '40s while still maintaining a distinctly modern feel, and also moves at a deliberate pace, as it is loaded with snappy dialogue, clever editing, and over-the-top violence.<br /><br />The film's only real flaw is its hit-and-miss acting, but I guess this may have been done somewhat on purpose, perhaps to further enforce the comic book element? Maybe, but I doubt it.<br /><br />But that aside, ""Sin City"" is a truly great, original film that screams for numerous sequels, as it seems like it just has so much more to show us. It almost feels like this film is just an appetizer. Let's hope Rodriguez doesn't destroy the sequels to this wonderful instant classic, which is arguably the best comic book-to-film adaptation ever made.<br /><br />9/10",Sin City
5301732,B004SIPA0A, A329U9CDUPKXAC,5.0, Excellent,"Visually, it's perfect. Every shot could easily be transferred into a frame of a comic book. It's mostly in black and white but it's beautiful nonetheless. The use of shadows and light is amazing. Each of the stories I found interesting but it did take a little while to develop an interest in each one of them. I think the movie ran a little long but, still, I really enjoyed it. It made me want to read the comic. I hope there's a Sin City 2.",Sin City
5301733,B004SIPA0A, A249L2HDZJ8YDU,5.0, 5 star entertainment,"This is a visually stunning and thoroughly enjoyable film.I don't think it will appeal to everyone.However,if you try not to be put off by the look of the thing - the story and action are interesting enough on their own.To be honest,the style of the film only serves to enhance it's watchability and afterwards you are left with the sense that-if it wasn't so stylized you would probably feel that something was missing.",Sin City
5301734,B004SIPA0A, A1XK78VXIP8Q21,4.0, Visually stunning,"Let me start by saying I'm not a huge Robert Rodriguez fan.  I've seen a number of his films.  I saw all three of his El Mariachi/Desperado/Once Upon a Time in Mexico trilogy, each time thinking, oh surely I'll like _this_ one.  But I never really was crazy about his stuff.  So when this came out, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it.  And I didn't.<br /><br />Then one night in a hotel room I saw a trailer for it.  And I changed my mind and immediately rented it.  It was visually incredible. It's like you could stop each and every frame of this movie and it would replicate a page from the graphic novel/comic book.  (No, I haven't read any of them, but you can just tell the artistry in framing everything.  It's stunning.)<br /><br />There are some down sides.  It's excruciatingly violent, so if you are offended by that, then obviously stay away.  In addition, I never felt particularly close to any of the characters so when violence happened to them, I didn't really feel anything.  (I am particularly thinking of the Carla Gugino character here.)  I'm not sure if that was deliberate or not, but I wish it had elicited something more from me emotionally.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke was incredible and almost unrecognizeable, but I thought Elijah Wood did a great and creepy job as well.<br /><br />My favorite Rodriguez movie ever.  Hands down.",Sin City
5301735,B004SIPA0A, A14KWMUENAVP21,5.0, Film Noir meets Comic Violence,"Frank Miller's immensely popular noir comic books come to the screen with the perfection of a skilled film-maker, a man that has made some wonderful films...and a not-so-good 3D film, Spy Kids. Sin City is the epitome of comic-noir, the psychedelic dream of pulp books and films. I have never read a comic so damn entertaining and grounded. And now I've never seen a comic-to-film adaptation so damn close to its source material.<br /><br />If you've never read a comic by Frank Miller, it won't matter when seeing Sin City. The tone is always dark and brooding, with a light comic touch, narrated in such a way as to mimic the style of a 50's crime novel. ""She smelled the way angels ought to smell,"" says Marv, a hulking brute, down on life, the center of one of the three stories in the film. A beautiful woman lies next to him on the bed, naked as the day she was born, and gleaming in full color while all around her is laced in black and white. She's dead. And Marv wants to know how and why. A whole world of corruption falls into his lap, pointing the finger at him, framing him, making him the fall guy. But Marv will get the truth out of somebody, and that somebody will have hell to pay.<br /><br />Another of the tales centers around a retiring cop in pursuit of a pedophile, one that gets off on hearing little girls scream as he tortures them and rapes them. But this pedophile is the son of a powerful and corrupt senator. Crap hits the fan, needless to say.<br /><br />The third tale is about hookers running a certain part of Sin City. The cops look the other way while they run the streets. One day all this comes crashing down when a sleazy cop is murdered by Miho, one of the many hookers running the area - she kicks butt like no other in this film, like something out of Tarantino's Kill Bill. Everything begins to fall apart, and it ends in a graphic bloodbath.<br /><br />Sin City is nearly identical to the comics word for word, shot for shot. Try reading one of the comics and then watch the film, you'll be amazed at the intricacy. The look of the film is all black and white, exactly as you would see them in the books. Hints of color pop out at you from time to time; blood is always red, eyes of a few beautiful ladies are blue or green, Blondie's hair is shiny gold. It is truly a masterpiece of design. Robert Rodriguez directs this film as if using Frank Miller's comics as storyboards, where all the shots were set up as many as fifteen years ago. The all star cast takes up the characters as if they were tailor-made for them when the stories were written. Anyone else not so gifted an actor could have put this film in the grave long before its release. Each actor's ability on screen shines forth with ferocity and dedication.<br /><br />Every shot, every scene, every nuance of Sin City is like a painted picture, one that can be free of its bonds on paper and flow with grace, creating a perfect whole of film noir and comic violence.",Sin City

5301737,B004SIPA0A, A26Z0YLA6H20VT,4.0, Something Unique,"While there is plenty to find unfulfilling in this movie, Robert Rodriguez, has a unique vision that recreates the edge and darkness conveyed in Frank Miller's original graphic novels. The director's sparse use of color, intense violence, and narration, doesn't so much develop characters but establishes them in very specific roles. Three-dimensional these characters are not, but because of the world they inhabit, this should be no surprise. The main characters in each vignette are anti-heroes, not called forth to protect the innocent or week, but to seek out redemption for the wrongs that have slighted them or the ones they care for.<br /><br />Out of all the vignettes, it was Mickey Rourke's turn that is truly a stand-out. His career has always seen him take roles as anti-hero ne'er-do-wells but in this role, he clearly relishes the power his character possesses. The brutality and hunger for a fight come across genuine, with no attempt to endear the character to the audience. He is there for one thing and one thing only, to seek out those stacked against him and brings them all down to the hell he inhabits in his own mind.<br /><br />This movie, while gratuitous in its use of violence and sex, is breathtaking in its presentation of that violence and sex, giving each raw energy and focus that, in such a limited amount of time, captures so much of what was remarkable of Mr. Miller's work.",Sin City

Sure, that means I wasn't truly surprised by the end, but really, it's rare that you get to see sure a great adaptation from the page to the screen. Atop that, I honestly think that ""Sin City"" is a fabulously shot film, almost every shot and angle is perfect, no flaws.

5301749,B004SIPA0A, A1I7FEEO6UOIBJ,5.0, A Great Movie With Lots Of Action,"I thought that Sin City was an instant classic. I thought that Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller had made an awesome movie. I also thought that the guest directing of Quentin Tarantino was amazing. Even though I haven't seen Kill Bill Vol. 1 or 2, I think that Sin City will be a great film for the ages. Also, the cast all played amazing roles in the movie and the casting directors all picked the right people for the movie. Here is my review about the casting and the directors job:<br /><br />First off, the casting call was an amazing job. I thought that when I saw the movie that they looked actually like the real comic. Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is saving a girl named Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba) from a bunch of killers. First off, I thought that the casting of Bruce Willis and Nancy Callahan as Jessica Alba was an amazing choice because he has the scar and he has the look and everything. I think that this story was an amazing choice because Bruce going against the Yellow Bastard was an awesome scene and a story.<br /><br />In the beginning, The Man (Josh Hartnett) and Shellie (Brittany Murphy) start talking about the city and how much of a sin it is. Then, The Man shoots Shellie, but she lives and the movie starts.<br /><br />Then it starts off with Marv (Mickey Rourke) getting with a girl named Goldie (Jaime King). Then, she dies with no scars and no bruises by a guy named Kevin (Elijah Wood). First, the casting of Mickey Rourke of Marv was like it just happened for him because I thought that he looked exactly like Marv. So, Marv goes on a rampage and goes looking for the killer of Goldie until he meets up with a girl named Wendy who is the twin of Goldie. The two go on a rampage and get the killer Kevin. In the end, Marv is in trouble with the cops and the people. In the end, he is in prison with an electric chair and he is dead. Goldie and Kevin were great casting calls for the movie.<br /><br />The second and final (since I told the last one), is about people named Dwight, Shellie, and Jackie Boy. Dwight (Clive Owen) is on a run to save the hookers of Sin City and trying to get the head of Jackie Boy, that the cops have so far. Shellie (Brittany Murphy) is in the beginning of this story trying to stop Jackie Boy (Bencio Del Toro) to abusing her. When Jackie Boy goes to the bathroom, Dwight goes and kills him, not knowing that he is a cop. When he finds out that he is a cop, he's got to stop the rest of the cops so that they don't find out about his head. He teams up with Miho (Devon Aoki) to save the person that he loves who happens to be Gail (Rosario Dawson) from Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) and the person that told them, Becky (Alexis Bledel). Although Becky lives, the rest of the cops die and Gail and Dwight are happily together in Sin City.<br /><br />I think that Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job making this a black and white movie with some color (kind've like the comic). Although, when I first heard of this movie, I wasn't really excited to see this movie. Then, I read some reviews and heard from people that this is an awesome movie. I watched it and it is way better than most of the movies that I have seen lately. Great casting calls for all of the people and make sure that you go and you watch this movie because you will not be dissapointed.<br /><br />In a rating for this movie out of ten, it will give it a 9/10.<br /><br />Rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity, and sexual content including dialogue.",Sin City

It was gritty and in-your-face and completely shocking.  Even though most of the movie is black and white, there was just so much going on.  It kept you on your feet from intro to credits.  So take an awesome storyline, add a power cast of heavy hitter actors and you've got an equation for one kickass movie!!!  Buy it, this is a must-have to anyone's collection.",Sin City

""That Yellow Bastard part 1"" tells us how hard-boiled officer John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) swore to protect a young girl named Nancy (Makenzie Vega) from a child-killer/rapist named Roak Junior (Nick Stahl) but fails then next we have ""The Hard Good-Bye"" where a big-chinned powerhouse named Marv (Mickey Rouke) was having an affair with a sexy girl named Goldie (Jaime King) until he wakes up to find her dead. He has been set-up as he runs from the law as he interrogates some people including a priest (Frank Miller) for finds out a crazed swifted clawed maniac named Kevin (Elijah Wood) who has a taste to literally eat prostitutes and finds out the rotten cardinal (Rutger Hauer) is all behind this for justice must be served. Following after that ""The Big Fat Kill"" has Dwight (Clive Owen) taking care of an abusive man named Jackie-Boy (Benico Del Toro) but while he finds the sleaziest part of town run by protective prostitues lead by tough but sexy leader Gail (Rosario Dawson) who wage a war with some mercenaries like Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan). Then we have ""That Yellow Bastard part 2"" has Hartigan sentenced 9 years to prison then after that he is released to find the young girl Nancy (Jessica Alba) all grown up at 19, unfortunately a deformed yellow man named Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahls) kidnaps her as he must save the girl then finally we end with part 2 of ""The Customer is Always Right"" where i won't reveal to you the ending.<br /><br />A brilliant, cold-blooded and hard boiled adaptation of Frank Miller's groundbreaking graphic novel series from Dark Horse Comics. Robert Rodriguez who is one of the best action directors joins up with Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino to make a dazzling cocktail of a movie with stunning visual effects. I like how it accurately depicts 4 graphic novels in one movie page-by-page scene-by-scene shot in glorious black-and-white with some color tints in some areas for select objects. The violence is gory and graphic but mainly white colored at times to make it look like out of the comics which is a very nifty and creative idea i should say. The performances are very good as is the direction by 3 directors and i love the surreal nature of the design for the film. Co-starring Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Jason Duoglas and Brittney Murphy i gotta say the casting was spot on especially Mickey Rouke as Marv was absolutely perfect. I saw this movie 4 times in theaters as i knew they would not screw up this adaptation and satisfies action fans including fans of comics/graphic novels.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray set has absolutely flawless picture and sound quality like if it was like going to the theaters. Disc one has Cine-Explorer where you hear an audio commentary by the filmmakers plus shots from the graphic novels with green screen test footage along with the movie as you watch plus audience reaction track as well. Disc 2 has the unrated recut extended edition which is longer and violent with cool extras like ""Kill em good"" which is an interactive comic plus Rodgriguez extras like 16 minute film school, all green screen version, the long take, Sin City: Live in Concert and 10 minute cooking school. Additional extras are featurette on how they put the graphic novels on film, interview with Quentin Taranitno, 3 featurettes and trailers and teasers.<br /><br />A must have for cinema fans and even geeks of comic book/graphic novel films.",Sin City

Every second of this movie bled style. From its cool charicters, neat presentaion, super acting, even to corny nior-film like voice overs ad a lot of depth to the people and you know what they are thinking when stuff is happening to them. Its an awsome way of story telling. This is strictly a Guy-movie, the very,very,very bloody action will make some people sick (ex. they show a guy getting a hatchet to the head...yeesh). So, yeah great movie and if all you care about is the movie, get this DVD, but...<br /><br />This DVD has almost 0 special features to speak of. No commentary, no actor bios, no good featurettes (except for a lame 8 min. short.). This DVD is seriously lacking speicial features. It doesn't even have a Specila features menu, the short is on the main menu. LAME. This movie could have had some cool documentaries on the source material. Too bad.<br /><br />Movie- 5/5<br /><br />DVD- 0/5",Sin City
5301753,B004SIPA0A, A1VYD8OKS7VICD,4.0, The Law of Hammurab,"The name tells the truth of this movie! This is a real (Ba)Sin City. Lot of violence, blood, almost naked women, immorality, suffer, revenge and sex(not so much what I waited for).  The law of Hammurab rules people on the Sin City. Eye to eye, teeth to teeth. You can't be never sure who is your fried and who is your fried. It's better to watch your back!<br /><br />The Main reason why liked this movie wasn't violence, good stories, music and naked woman. They also suited this movie very well but without great actors and actress, I had ever enjoyed this film so much.<br /><br />Especially, Mickey Rourke(Marv), Bruce Willis(Hartigan) and Elijah Wood (Kevin)<br /><br />Rourke made a great comeback first class. He was very famous in the 80s(for exemple 9 weeks) but lost his status in the 90s(there were many bad movies). Without his character Marv this movie has get me only 3 stars. Marv is very rude, angry, powerful die-hard, ungly and interesting person. Rourke really plays his role with unbelieveable emotion and  skill.<br /><br />In my mind, Willis has always been a good action actor.  In this movie he has even better survivor than Die Hard films. So many gun shots, hits and even gallows pole won't stop him. Willis has come better actor and can express his feelings better than before.<br /><br />Everyone remembers Elijah Wood on the Lord of the Ring movies.<br /><br />He can't escape it but luckily they were amazing films.<br /><br />Sin City shows that Wood can also play a wicked man role well.<br /><br />Kevin is the most sickest character on this movie(cannibal, soul eater, the collector od dead people's faces). Unfortunately, his role small but remarkable. He don't speak at all but facial expressions, fast movements, sharp nails, dark personality and his animal fried makes his role unique.<br /><br />I liked also woman characters. Devon Aoki(Miho) was taken on Kill Bill movies because she was so deathly and cold minded than anu woman character on these movies.  Jessica Alba ( Nancy Callahan) danced beautifully and looked captivating.<br /><br />Finally, this movie was worth of watching and I am going to see it again same day.",Sin City
5301754,B004SIPA0A, A1U537KOOROPL9,4.0," It ain't kid-friendly, that's for sure.","For anyone seeking realistic sets, characters, or action...<br /><br />For anyone hoping for toned-down nudity or sexuality...<br /><br />For anyone feeling sickened by the relentless violence of today's most murderous movies...<br /><br />For anyone looking for a calm movie night with the PTA...<br /><br />This film is NOT for you - but it sure is cool.<br /><br />If gratutious gore (albeit virtually all black and white and highly stylized) isn't your thing and you have a hang-up about on-screen nakedness, please don't watch this.  You'll hate it.  I don't know why anyone would seek out Frank Miller's seedy world of make-believe for character and plot realism, but apparently some people did, and those people hated the movie.  But on with a review...<br /><br />I went to see this movie out of sheer curiosity (and a strong desire to see Elijah Wood as a bad guy - wacky, huh?) and found it to be one of the most entertaining films I've seen in quite a while.  I'd never heard of Frank Miller, which I suppose means I live under a rock, but I had seen some fairly mediocre attempts at making comic-book worlds translate adequately to film (Joel Shumaker does ""Batman,"" for example - ok, mediocre is HIGHLY generous here).  ""Sin City,"" however, does absolutely no apologizing for the fictional Basin City's other-worldliness.  It takes the illustrator's vision head-on and makes it a moving picture, which is a new and fantastic idea, but maybe that's the real difference between a comic book and a graphic novel (well, that and 15 bucks).<br /><br />Alright, the acting is stylized.  Big hairy deal.  It should be for this movie.  Clive Owen's American accent cracks me up, by the way.  Some of the actors pull off being evil characters a lot better than I thought they would, and some lend themselves to scummy parts naturally (ok, that was harsher than I meant it, Benicio).  As I said, Elijah Wood as Kevin was a big reason I saw it in the first place, and the creepiest thing about him is that, for crying out loud, it's the kid from ""Radio Flyer"" gone all Hannibal Lecter (except crazier & silent).  The women in the film aren't exactly the feminist ideal, but I doubt anyone would deny ""deadly little Miho's"" ability to make her point, or Rosario Dawson's ability to command respect.  Nick Stahl, um, looked better in ""Terminator 3,"" but in ""Sin City"" gives one of the most sickeningly twisted performances I'm sure he'll ever do.  I'm not a Bruce Willis fan, but he's good.  Mickey Rourke is incredible as Marv - just stinking incredible.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked this movie, but I'm not sure I could like, watch it every day or anything, just because I think it would warp my fragile little mind.  The R rating is there for a reason - or 70 - so watch out.",Sin City
5301755,B004SIPA0A, A2PA87P7JO9T2J,5.0, Warning *Spoilers* Abound,"First I have to cover the basics. I don't know if I've ever been made so physically uncomfortable by a movie that also entertained me and sparked my interest so much. I doubt if more than two minutes went by during the entire movie where there wasn't an unbelievable amount of blood on the screen. Short of a few, every scene in this movie contained gratuitous violence to a level that I can't honestly say I've been exposed to before. There was torture, castration, rape, cannibalism, prostitution, more castration, and on top of it all a dazzling web of intrigue that will not soon be topped by moviemakers.<br /><br />Of course it wasn't all scenes of spine-chilling, gut-wrenching violence, there was love in this movie, there was honor, there was justice. Nearly every action taken on the part of the, for lack of a better word, protagonists was taken to protect someone they love. The critics say that the writer supplied the obligatory ""feelings"" to these characters simply to facilitate the violence, but I disagree. These characters were twisted and destructive, there is no doubt about that, but in a world that was so much more twisted than they were their actions became surprisingly justified. Shooting off the penis of a man didn't seem quite so bad when it became clear that the man was a child rapist. In a town where innocent girls grew up to be militant whores, a senator had the power to kill a man laying incapacitated in a hospital bed, and a mute psycho led by a sadistic cardinal killed and ate prostitutes I had no grievances against the actions of the just, regardless of how unsettling they were. I suppose some blame can be put on the writer for creating such a world and it could be said that the creation of such a world was done solely to facilitate the violence, but I don't think that's true either. These characters were vivid and interesting. Their actions existed in such a morally ambiguous world that you couldn't help but side with those that came across as even half-way human.<br /><br />The visual style was the reason that I went to see this movie and I was not disappointed. A black and white movie is rare enough these days, but this may be the first to ever feature simple flashes and splashes of color. The black and white actually helped this world come to life. Throughout most of the movie it wasn't even apparent that nothing was physically real. Stylistically and cinematically it was a good idea to never bring out the city and instead to focus on the characters... and the blood. Since the color that was used was always used to bring focus to the actions of those on screen it easily distracted from the cartoonish backdrop that they took place in. When there was no color to speak of, like during aerial shots, it didn't matter that the world looked ethereal because it was supposed to; providing an unearthly setting helped separate Sin City from our world in an entirely necessary way.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with this movie is that, when spoken, it becomes ridiculously apparent that comic narrative and dialogue is stilted and overly-blunt. I did like some things that Miller did with it though; near the end of every chapter it ties back to the beginning with a simple line of narrative that has taken on a completely different meaning throughout the scenes. I'm assuming that this was done originally in the comics, but it is still well done.<br /><br />I'm glad that Frank Miller actually wrote and directed this movie. Normally when people try to adapt comics into movies they end up missing the point of the original work entirely because they don't consult the author, but when the author writes and directs the adaptation those problems cease to exist. I guess Quentin only directed one scene, but I'll be damned if I know which one it was; they all could have been him.<br /><br />I would talk about the actors in this, but none of them really did anything for me. They were all sufficiently good, not overly impressive or painfully bad. Brittany Murphy, for the first time, didn't annoy me like she normally does. Josh Hartnett had no more than half-a-dozen lines, which I appreciated. Alexis Bledel, TV's pristine Rory Gilmore, played a back-stabbing prostitute, which was amusing. On the whole, there was nothing that impressive about any of them. The writing and visual work covered up for them perfectly though, so they had nothing to worry about. Jessica Alba is scantly dressed for the vast majority of the movie, so if nothing else she can distract you from anything you don't like.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to the squeamish, but if you can handle it it's a movie you won't soon forget.",Sin City

5301757,B004SIPA0A, AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ,4.0, The Moose Hole - 'Sin'fully Addictive,"No one, it would seem, has worked as hard or received more satisfaction and dedication out of his work within the movie industry then Robert Rodriguez. Starting off with a seven thousand dollar budget and a camera in hand, El Mariachi sparked the career of one of the most imaginative and sought after directors of our generation. He has not only taken up the responsibility of directing and writing the script for each of his films, but he has also acted as the composer, visual supervisor, editor, producer, production designer, and sound editor for several of them as well. Furthermore, not a single one of his films, including the visually complex and celebrity laden Sin City, was made for more then forty-million dollars, virtually unheard of in the modern Hollywood environment of one-hundred million dollars being the average price for a tent-pole project. Truly, Robert Rodriguez is a rogue of the film industry and his audience would not have it any other way.<br /><br />The story for Sin City not only meticulously blends seemingly individual plotlines together into a single cohesive feature film, but it also resonates the very characteristics that have made the film-noir genre so enticing and appealing to movie-goers over the years. More importantly, the script emphasizes a sad truth of life, which is that certain circumstances require morally corrupt individuals to put a stop to even more morally corrupt individuals from doing harm onto others. Sadly, unlike Superman and Spider-Man, not all comic-book heroes are as ethically heroic as would be believed. The only visible complexities within the script were the transition of one story arch to the next, which should have transferred more smoothly then it did, and the lack of connection in terms of intertwining characters and subplots between the three stories. It could have been more compelling and interesting had Rodriguez and Miller found a way to better blend the three separate storylines together, integrating several of the characters into blended scenes, more then the mere glimpse we receive of Marv in the bar that Hartigan steps into to search for Nancy, but it works fine enough as it stands.<br /><br />In spite of his appearance in numerous television productions since 1989, only in the last few years has British performer Clive Owen received recognition in Hollywood having been offered the leading role in the Jerry Bruckheimer production, King Arthur, and his Academy Award-nominated performance in Closer. Owen truly accentuates the role of Dwight, a rogue out to stop Jack Rafferty, performed by Benicio Del Toro, from harming the hookers of Old Towne, and his somber voice-over narration of the events depicted, typical of the film-noir genre, adds to the entertainment value. Del Toro's Jack Rafferty is the type of character which the audience would care to have a little more background information on in order to firmly grasp the concept of what is taking place in several scenes, but perhaps that is too much involvement then is required for some people.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke, a name of whom few within the current generation of young adult movie-goers would recall hearing before, has been long overdue for a comeback performance, appearing in The Rainmaker and The Thin Red Line, and he more then makes up for the string of commercial failures on his resume in the role of Marv. Observing his magnetic performance onscreen, it was as if Frank Miller, creator of the Sin City graphic comic series, created the figure of Marv specifically for Mickey Rourke, it is that comprehensive and enthralling. Though not the fault of the scriptwriting team, Jaimie King receives the short end of the performance stick in the role of Goldie given as how she dies within the first few minutes we see of her and even when she returns as Wendy, Goldie's twin sister, she doesn't do much beyond a few scenes with Rourke. And who better to fill the role of the silent and deadly cannibalistic assassin, Kevin, a young psychopath enlisted by the corrupt governmental structure of Sin City to kill off Goldie and pin the crime on Marv, then Elijah Wood? Was there honestly no one else within the same height structure as Wood that would have served as effectively in this role as he did? This is not meant to discredit his performance by any means. On the contrary, Wood turns what could have easily been an unintentionally derisive character into one of the most enigmatical and haunting figures in the film. The problem lies in the fact that when the audience sees Wood they automatically recall his performance as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Ring trilogy and the effect his character is suppose to have on them goes down a slight notch or two because of this.<br /><br />Jessica Alba, better known for her involvement in the short-lived James Cameron television series, Dark Angel, on Fox, is stunning to say the least about her in the role of Nancy Callahan, the young potential rape victim who grows up to be a strong-willed exotic dancer. And while it is still a little early to make a judgment call as to whether she will have a longstanding career in the film industry seeing as how her role is limited to the `damsel in distress' caricature familiar to the film-noir genre, her performance holds up quite well opposite veteran actor Bruce Willis. Willis plays up the role of John Hartigan, quite possibly the only honest cop in the Sin City police force, with gusto, as he had done in such other gritty dramas as Pulp Fiction and Twelve Monkeys. It was fascinating to see the relationship which existed between Nancy Callahan and John Hartigan develop into a chivalrous `knight on a white horse riding to the rescue of his fair maiden in distress' love affair onscreen. And though this will certainly receive some negative feed back from some audience members, this in a way represents a double-standard in our society. Headlined prominently in such risqu&eacute; comedies as Sex in the City as well as in those insufferable tabloid newsmagazines, Mr. Willis being one of their more recent targets, is the belief that older women chasing after young men for sexual pleasure is perfectly acceptable while relationships which exist between older men and younger women is repulsive and depraved. Though this type of behavior may not exactly be everyone's cup of tea, there is certainly nothing morally objectionable to it given that it is for a loving relationship and not merely sexual intimacy alone and our society must comes to terms with this fact. Sure, it would have been nice for Rodriguez or Miller to have provided the audience with a bit more information concerning the previous sexual attacks made by Junior against young little girls in order to receive a better idea on the type of character that is being dealt with, but it is understandable enough that it is not required. In any event, Nick Stahl gives a decent, if not limited, performance in the role of the senator's son, eventually evolving into the monster known as the Yellow Bastard. Unfortunately, this thus mentioned character leaves several questions unanswered. Why did he become yellow? What is the cause of this horrible smell emulating from the bastard which is repeatedly mentioned by either Hartigan or others? Yes, these are minor, if not trivial, matters but when it comes to a feature this imaginative, nitpicking is going to be a result.<br /><br />Overall, in spite of its failure to emphasize a canonical point within its script, Sin City is nonetheless nothing short of visually arresting entertainment in the best sense of the word and serves as one of the more innovative feature film projects to crawl out of the works in recent years. Truly stunning in terms of its scope, direction, and graphic style, which is balanced out thanks to the exceptionally amplified performances of its cast members and the pertinent dialogue throughout the two-hour movie. As marveling as this presentation turned out to be, it should be noted that there were some, albeit trivial in respects, minor complaints to be made. Rodriguez and Miller had a captivating concept going when Marv discussed through narration how he was confused within his mind as to whether the actions he was taking were that of a justifiable avenger of his lover's death or merely the aspirations of a psychopathic killer everyone said he would be come to life, but instead is only focused on briefly before being lost in the shuffle. It would have been interesting to see what may have developed had this been expanded on in the script. And though the violence featured in Sin City is meant to be comical in nature, visualize it alone the lines as the fight sequences seen in Kill Bill Vol. 1, and not to be taken seriously, there were particular scenes in which it was too over the top to be taken seriously. For example, the scene in which Benicio Del Toro's Jack Rafferty had not only his hand cut off but also has his gun backfire into his forehead and has his head cut `like a Pez dispenser', went a little too far it seems and should have been cut down more cleanly. There is no problem with violence being featured prominently in live-action adult movies, but should it merely be violence for the sake of being violence, it doesn't make sense for the film to bite off more then it can chew. Still, the black and white visual quality of the film spliced with hints of iridescence, the scintillating reverberation of rain in the dark night of the back alleys, passionate and harrowing tales of chivalrous love affairs, and plenty of vital fluids and savagery to satisfy even the most hardcore of Taratino fanatics, are reasons enough to resurrect the hopes of movie-goers disillusioned over the years by the stale and unoriginal presentations and hoard them back to the local Cineplex in droves.",Sin City

I guess that means the ""Ayes"" have it in this case...and I'm among them.  I guess those reviewers think that 90% of the people who've rated the film here are stupid, depraved, sexist, or all of the above.<br /><br />Let's take a look at the detractors for a moment, shall we?<br /><br />First, there are those who are appalled at the level of violence, despite a great deal of it taking place off-screen (in the comics, it should be pointed out, they would not have had this luxury).  But these are the same people who complain about violent films across the board (though they generally ignore the violence in certain movies because they LIKE them, regardless).  There have been FAR more violent films than Sin City (including The Passion of the Christ, a movie generally hailed by those who hate Sin City)...but these folks like to talk about this movie as if it's the ne plus ultra of gore.  This is ludicrous, and these people aren't worth discussing, really...so we'll move on.<br /><br />""This movie was so sexist, I can't believe it!  This is NOT a female-friendly film!!!""  Interesting.  My girlfriend, who is simultaneously a strong, independent woman and an unashamed ""girly girl,"" really loved this movie.  Then I gave her the comics to read, and she loved them as well...so we went to see the movie again.  Of course, she doesn't look at things from such a narrow point of view.  She recognizes that EVERY character in Sin City is an archetype...the men are portrayed just as badly as the women, if not worse.  Despite all of the talk about women being degraded and brutalized in Sin City, most of the bruality is aimed at the male characters, and the most empowered characters in the film are women.  Go figure.<br /><br />""This isn't really film noir...what a rip-off.""  I've heard every conceivable argument here, and don't agree one bit.  ""Film noir has lead characters with fatal flaws...Sin City doesn't.""  Were we watching the SAME Sin City?  The Sin City in which EVERY lead character has at least ONE fatal flaw?  To say that Hartigan, Dwight, and (come on, people) Marv have no fatal flaws is like saying that James Dean had no style.  Next.  ""Film noir has characters double-crossing each other...Sin City doesn't.""  You mean like Bob shooting his partner in the back?  Like Becky selling out her friends for mob money?  These don't constitute double-crosses?  Again, were we watching the same movie?  Next.  ""Film noir has plot twists...Sin City doesn't.""  Oh, come on!  Let's not be stupid here, people.  Sin City has everything that film noir requires...flawed characters, double-crosses, bleak worldview, complex character relationships, high-level corruption...you name it.  Sin City is film noir, and the people who point out what film noir is supposed to be are simply proving my point.<br /><br />""This movie is SOOOOOOO derivative of Tarantino's movies (or any other popular director)!!!!!!!""  Is it?  Despite the fact that the original Sin City comics were released in 1991, when QT was still relatively unknown?  I've heard people say that Sin City is a Pulp Fiction rip-off, despite the fact that much of the material in Sin City was written and drawn before Pulp Fiction, and the film is essentially a carbon copy of Miller's comics.  That's strange...perhaps Mr. Miller has a time machine?<br /><br />Among those who are fans of the comics, there have been very few complaints...the only one I've heard was from a chap who complained that the film was TOO MUCH like the comics (which I didn't understand in the first place), but then went on to point out things that were left out of the movie, and how that bothered him.  Seems he was so confused that he couldn't decide whether he hated the movie for being too faithful to the comics, or not faithful enough.  But apart from him, it seems that every fan of Miller's comics is hailing Sin City as the ultimate comic book adaptation...and with good reason.  It is a PERFECT translation from page to screen, unlike anything I have ever seen.  Finally, comic book fans have a film that doesn't pointlessly alter the storyline, doesn't change the style, doesn't ruin the dialogue of the books, doesn't kill the mood of the source material.<br /><br />In my opinion, Sin City is the perfect comic book movie, painstakingly adapted from one of the most powerful comic book series in the history of the medium.  And it seems that the majority agree with me.  That doesn't necessarily mean that we're right...maybe we ARE all stupid, depraved, sexist buffoons, however unlikely that may be...but hopefully, I've done a sufficient job of explaining why I think this is a great movie, why I will always have a place in my heart for it, and why I'm eagerly awaiting the next Sin City film.<br /><br />This review was written by a well-studied film buff...who is in no way a sexist, an idiot, or a psychopath.",Sin City
5301763,B004SIPA0A, A1NCYRETY9WFHG,5.0, A nice DVD package.,"This is a nice package for a film such as this.  My only wish, is that it would contain more interviews with Frank Miller and how he brought Sin City to life as a comic book.  But other than that, there's a nice selection of interesting features on how they made this fantastic film.  Plus, this DVD contains a complete copy of The Hard Goodbye, which is one of the original graphic novels.  It's fun DVD to have.  I hope you like it!",Sin City
5301764,B004SIPA0A, A2EFA8TUP4TF96,3.0, 2/3 awesomeness,"Well, the appeal of this movie pretty much resides entirely in the coolness factor. You know, where gruesome things and unusual events are displayed to stimulate the viewer's gut reactions (such as excitement, disgust, arousal, awe, etc) in a very pornographic sort of way.<br /><br />This works wonders in certain segments. The story of the kid who murders prostitutes, for example, has quite the well-executed combination of excitement, disgust and awe-induction. It is disgusting, exciting, awe-inducing, exactly like it's supposed to be. Coolness achieved. Very cool.<br /><br />But the part about the prostitutes with guns killed it for me... it was so boring and so illogical and it took up probably 1/3 of the movie. Yes, they are prostitutes, they have guns, that's supposedly arousing... I get it. I got it after the first five seconds. You can't drag that out for what seems like an hour without an actual story, and the ""story"" in this case was an illogical hole-ridden mess, clearly just a sorry attempt at justifying the lengthy scenes of scantily clad prostitutes. I mean, I get that this movie is supposed to be glorifying the tacky and hormonal elements of the comic book/neo-noir genre... but that whole segment adds absolutely nothing to this idea, and was not one bit better than watching a random porn movie.<br /><br />In conclusion... I appreciate all of this movie, except for the 1/3 or so that was taken up by the prostitutes-with-guns segment, which I ferociously despise. So I'm not really sure what to think of this movie as a whole... I guess it all evens out to be sort of mediocre. It's an amazing film when I fast forward through the stupid part, but I can't really give this movie any credit for my own post-release editing.",Sin City
5301765,B004SIPA0A, A1TOXCG4QWQLHA,4.0, Highly Entertaining and Unique production makes this an excellent movie.,"The movie is very intense, disturbing with lots of slice and dice blood and gore. It still is a very entertaining movie. The unique style of filming which blends comic book style visuals with very dark overtone, makes the movie an excellent choice for the comic book enthusiast. The story line is good - but not great. There are weak threads in the movie which though not absolutely necessary, do weaken the fabric of the movie. The characters are excellent and very well developed and at the end of the movie you feel like you just read a 200 pages intense comic book with some richly designed visuals. If cannibalism, unnecessary killing and every other psycho habit that you can think of - disturbs you, then do not watch this flick. If you're thicks skinned, get this!",Sin City
5301766,B004SIPA0A, A1A535W556ROBQ,3.0, A city drenched in violence,"You have to give Robert Rodriguez credit for remaining faithful to Frank Miller's vision, but the graphic novels do not translate very well to the screen.  It reminded me alot of Richard Romanus' Heavy Metal, as Rodriguez tried to piece together several of Frank Miller's stories into one movie.  Still, I liked the look and feel of the movie, a deeply saturated black and white with spot colors.  It was interesting to see such actors as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood transformed beyond all recognition.  Clive Owen proved to be an inspired choice as Dwight, making a good contrast to Benecio del Toro's talking head.  But, in the end, this movie simply didn't add up.  It was more like a promotion for Frank Miller's serial graphic novels, which he continues to put out having gone beyond comic heros such as Batman and the Daredevil.  This isn't kids' stuff, but a series drenched in lurid sex and violence, which seems to be the staple of pulp fiction these days.",Sin City
5301767,B004SIPA0A, A2JLSHTST2SP1I,3.0, So where are the extras?,"I can't address ""Sin City""'s content because this is a polarizing film - either you adore it or you don't, and you already know which camp you belong to. Love it or hate it, ""Sin City"" is an amazing technical breakthrough. Roberto Rodriguez has always stretched his low budgets to the limit, but with ""Sin City,"" he proved that greenscreens and computer technology need not be limited solely to science fiction. The digitally-inserted backgrounds and compositing of different actors are totally convincing. Furthermore, unlike previous attempts at the technique (which look like Photoshop on acid), there's a realism present here that leads me to believe that smart producers in the future will rely more and more on greenscreens and less and less on location shooting. This is a rare example of special effects that are totally in service of the story. I think it's worth a look for that reason, especially if you're a budding computer-savvy filmmaker.<br /><br />How strange and cruel, then, that only a skimpy mini-documentary is included as a behind-the-scenes extra. They could bring us multiple ""collectable"" DVD cases, but they couldn't give us real insight into the making of this movie? This is nearly as bad as the very earliest DVD releases (such as ""2001"" and ""Blade Runner"") in which there were absolutely no extras to speak of. Why? Just a year ago a movie like ""Sin City"" would be a two-disc affair with extras that did everything short of telling us whether Rodriguez and Miller prefered ham sandwiches to cole slaw and now we get a bare bones package! It shows real contempt for the fans of this movie.<br /><br />If you absolutely must own this DVD right now, there's nothing I can say to persuade you otherwise. As for me, I'm riding this one out and waiting either for the inevitable upgraded version in a few months or a substantially cheaper used copy. Frankly, it's insulting that they can't give us extras but can give us our choice of four different DVD covers. It's a gimmick worthy of 1990s comic book companies, but totally unacceptable for a major Hollywood release.",Sin City

5301769,B004SIPA0A, A16QODENBJVUI1,5.0," Arguably the most original, brilliant film of the year","With the appearance of SIN CITY (I managed to see it at a preview the day before general release), we have what is easily the finest adaptation yet of any graphic novel.  Not merely that, this amazing film replicates the visual excitement, dynamic vitality, and dramatic stylization of the genre.  SIN CITY isn't merely based on Frank Miller's film noir graphic tales, but an astonishingly accurate translation into a new version.  For that reason alone the film would stand out as one of the more remarkable films of recent years.<br /><br />Thankfully, SIN CITY is much more than a mere screen equivalent of some superb graphic tales:  it is by any standard a film of the front rank.  The success can be traced primarily to two individuals:  director Robert Rodriguez and writer Frank Miller.  Most fans will know that Miller has long resisted having his works turned into film, until Rodriguez sent him a brief test piece that would have knocked the hesitation of even the most sceptical author.  Miller's stories pay homage to the entire film noir and hardboiled tradition that began with Dashiell Hammett and BLACK MASK magazine (and its imitators) and has continued all the way until today with contemporary masters like James Ellroy, but he also gives each story a remarkable twist, while embedding all in a mythological setting.  Rodriguez's genius is in finding effective means to reincarnate these stories digitally.  I have been a fan of Rodriguez ever since I saw EL MARIACHI when it first came out, a film that I still consider the best no-budget film ever made, and despite the cost of the film one that will stand comparison with most of the big budget films ever made.  I have followed his subsequent career with both delight and dismay, as he did a shockingly inferior Hollywood remake of EL MARIACHI in DESPERADO that was a pale imitation of the original, and then made a string of movies that were either good (the first two SPY KIDS films), interesting if uneven (FROM DUSK TIL DAWN), or perplexingly unsuccessful (DESPERADO and ONCE UPON A TIME N MEXICO).  None of these seemed to fulfill the enormous promise of EL MARIACHI.  This one does.  This is the kind of film that possibly signals the emergence of a very promising director to the level of a great one.  The movie truly is that good.<br /><br />The film features an impressive cast, but this is not an actor's movie and they add less than one might expect.  That is not to say that they are not used well.  Indeed, Rodriguez uses all of the superbly.  Some are almost unrecognizable under various prostheses, in particular Mickey Rourke and Benicio Del Toro, neither of whom you would know was in the film unless made aware of it.  This film, in fact, represents something of a comeback for Rourke, who started off in the early 1980s as a hardboiled performer who seemed to have stepped off the pages of a Jim Thompson novel.  We've seen Bruce Willis do good things before (in addition to a lot of bad things), so his excellent job as a used up cop almost manically dedicated to preventing a young girl from being raped and murdered is no surprise.  Clive Owen, on the other hand, has been better in the past and will be better in the future.  One brilliant bit of casting was putting Jessica Alba in a key role (I'll skip the name because it would involve a spoiler).  I've always argued with friends that although Alba is without question one of the most stunningly attractive women in movies today, she is oddly not very good at being sexy.  Sure, she is sexy in that she has a face and body that are improbably perfect, but instead of radiating sex, she always manages to radiate sweetness and innocence.  You see her at length and you inevitably end up thinking, ""You know, she seems like she has to be a really sweet soul.""  That quality comes out here as well, and it tremendously adds to the believability of the story line of which her character is a part.  One actor whose presence is memorable even though it involved little contribution on his part was Elijah Wood as Kevin, who looks like a blend between a nerd and a manikin, but fights like a super ninja while sharing some of Hannibal Lecter's less appealing dietary habits.<br /><br />Each of the three major stories that are intertwined in the film revolves around a primary character acting as knight-errants.  In his foundational series of detective novels and stories, Raymond Chandler conceived of Phillip Marlowe as the modern, cynical embodiment of the medieval knight dedicated to fighting for damsels in distress.  Miller embraces this ideal completely in the three stories found here.  In Bruce Willis's sequence, he sacrifices everything to protect the innocent young Nancy.  In Mickey Rourke's amazing Marv sequence, a thuggish, seemingly indestructible, hideous brute of a man expends everything in order to avenge the death of a woman who has shown him a tiny bit of affectionate attention.  Clive Owen plays a man who struggles not merely for one woman but for a whole group of women.  Who said that chivalry is dead?<br /><br />Notice that I have gotten this far without saying anything about the technical innovations of the film.  Most will know that SIN CITY was primarily filmed by actors in front of green screens, with all of the backgrounds added through CGI.  SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW did this, though Rodriguez went so far as even to use digital cameras for the actors.  Some reviewers without having seen the film (look at a couple of the earliest reviewers here on Amazon, reviewers who clearly haven't seen the film) are so bothered by this that they automatically dismiss the film.  In fact, Rodriguez uses the CGI with great virtuosity, always using it to enhance and devolve the story, never to call attention to itself.  The CGI does give the stories much of the feel that one gets reading a comic, such as when Marv attacks two would-be hit men, shoving one into a brick wall, causing an indentation in it.  Unlike SKY CAPTAIN, however, the focus was always on the story and the characters, and not on the CGI.  The distribution company (Rodriguez is essentially his own studio, he and his wife operating on their own in Austin, Texas) complained about the film being in black and white, but it was a perfect choice.  There is a considerable amount of colorization, most of it to great effect.  For instance, in the opening sequence, a man is talking to a woman and mentions her eyes, and at the word ""eyes"" they go from black and white to a subtle green.<br /><br />I honestly feel that this film represents a turning point in several ways.  First, it might represent the complete shift from Robert Rodriguez from promising director to a full-fledged master.  Second, it could be the film that provides the model for all that follow in the correct use of CGI.  Third, it could serve as the pattern for future adaptations for the filming of graphic novels.  But all that aside, people need to see this because it is one of the best and most original films of the past couple of years.",Sin City
5301770,B004SIPA0A, A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,4.0, Sin City is a triumph for hardcore fans,"Frank Miller, the lord of graphic comic novels, has been given his just due in a sumptuously stylized film version of his Sin City.  Lovingly brought to the screen by Robert Rodriguez with an assist by buddy Quentin Tarantino, this tale of vengeance and lust in a dark metropolis is unlike any movie in recent years in terms of consistent technique and visuals serving a group of interconnected stories in which the outcasts of civilization engage in urban survival while attempting to maintain a sense of honor and love.  It is also an extremely violent film.<br /><br />On a dark, rainy night, three major stories parallel each other.  The first story has Detective John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) search for a missing girl before a serial killer strikes again. With his unsavory partner, Bob (Michael Madsen), he finally tracks down the killer in a bang-up finish, or is it?  A separate story has a brutish exconvict, Marv (Mickey Rourke), who seeks revenge for the murder of a hooker.  He is befriended by a parole officer, Lucille (Carla Gugino), a waitress, Shellie (Britanny Murphy), a stripper, Nancy (Jessica Alba), and a hooker, Gail (Rosario Dawson).  His search for the killer pulls him into a grisly world of murder led by psychopaths, dirty cops, and corrupt, political leaders.  Another story has a loner, Dwight (Clive Owen), protect his waitress girlfriend from a gang led by Jack (Benicio Del Toro) and a mob boss, Manute (Michael Clark Duncan).  Things come full circle once events unfold, and surprises are unveiled with seemingly unrelated events and characters linked together.<br /><br />To say more would spoil a smorgasbord of film noir and stylized action.  There are some clever plot twists and surprises along the way.  People's loyalties are constantly in question, and the three male leads are surrogate avengers for justice, redemption and salvation. The film's structure is reminiscent of Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction and even P. T. Anderson's Magnolia where various people meet in a series of vignettes and affect others who are seemingly unconnected.  There are moments that seem influenced by past films.  Certainly Sam Raimi's (Spiderman) earlier Darkman was a direct precursor to Sin City.  There is a scene with Clive Owen driving with a corpse that is a sort of homage to the 1945 horror classic The Body Snatchers.  Rutger Hauer plays a religious leader in a scene not unlike the scene in Blade Runner where ironically Hauer reversed roles as an assassin in that film.  A marvelous action piece with a female samurai warrior has all the earmarks of Tarantino who picks up where Kill Bill left off.<br /><br />It is fascinating to watch what is essentially a pre-storyboarded film with the graphic novel serving as a blueprint for the film.  `Shot and cut' by Rodriguez himself, the film feels very consistent with a true auteur's vision.  Frank Miller imagined it, and Rodriguez made it happen.  This is Rodriguez' most assured film thus far, and it is a living, breathing comic book in the best sense.  Despite the wide commercial appeal of successful comic adaptations of Spiderman and X-Men, Sin City is perhaps the most authentic and uncompromising transfer of such material.  Much of what is depicted onscreen is predominantly a fabrication of computer generated special effects and trendsetting photography within which the actors interact.  The black and white photography is at times gorgeous and downright nightmarish with the strategically accented color schemes similar to the best shots in Pleasantville and Schindler's List.  There is no doubt that the visuals of this film have been achieved with painstaking detail and success.<br /><br />A dream cast features a wealth of actors and actresses, any two of whom could have front lined separate features on their own.  Willis and Owen are quite effective as heroic, yet flawed personas, but it is Mickey Rourke who is a standout in what amounts to a comeback film.  Even under his Frankenstein-like makeup, his humanity and toughness shine through.  He makes the most of a potentially ridiculous role.  In addition, while the males are mostly rugged, disheveled hulks, the females are beautiful and extremely sexy (sleazy?) to say the least.  Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, and Carla Gugino, (sorely missed from her brief Karen Sisko tv series) sizzle on the screen as they crossover different storylines.  The performances are all fairly convincing once you excuse the occasional, awkward voice over narration.<br /><br />Some things are left hanging plot wise.  Many characters are almost caricatures; we have to accept them at face value without much depth.  We never fully understand the psychopathic monster that is played by Elijah Wood.  Where did he come from and why is he purely evil?  Likewise, a partnership, betrayal, and reconciliation at the beginning of the film are never fully explored.  The dialogue is a bit Jekyll and Hyde with some hokey lines followed by a series of sharp, humorous ones.<br /><br />This is a film superficially filled with nudity, explicit language, taboo subject matter, and buckets of bloody violence.  This is going to be offensive to many people who are put off by intense scenes of mayhem, but to those who thrive on the film noir of adult comic books, it is a dream come true.<br /><br />If this adaptation is a one shot deal, the filmmakers gave it their best efforts.  It is entirely plausible to have a sequel with an entirely different cast (even though a number of the principles survive this entry.)  This movie is a splendid exercise in look and mood with emotional substance, no mean feat.  It is definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those who are game, just hang on and enjoy the ride.  Ironically, although Sin City is a graphic film in every sense of the word, this tale of haunted characters in an amoral world is ultimately a moral film.",Sin City
5301771,B004SIPA0A, A1Z3LU078VNOA6,5.0, A visual and story-telling treat for the ages,"Oh. My. God.  Blu-ray was made for this.<br /><br />Every single pore on an actor's face.<br /><br />Every single strand of an actor's hair.<br /><br />This is one of the two or three most impressive live-action blu-ray discs ever released.  The stylish part-animated scenes are beautiful with their detail in backgrounds and crispness in foregrounds.  The close-ups show every crater in every face, every reflection off a spot of blood on every cheek, every fuzzy hair on every lip or brow.  Even dark scenes have no apparent black crush.  Not a trace of disturbing film grain or digital noise touches this picture.  There may never be another occasion to make a film on blu-ray disc that is this pretty, this perfect in every respect.  The opening scene is one that many filmgoers have dreamt of seeing in beautiful digh-definition, with glourious colours added in just the right places, and finally here it is.<br /><br />A film noir mixed with comic-book sensibilities, ""Sin City"" is a masterpiece of popular art.  It's ""Pulp Fiction"" with better art direction and an even more stylized sense of the absurd setting.  It's the hardboiled detective's own incarnation of John Ford; it's the art house Akira Kurosawa for nihilists who wished they were romantics.<br /><br />The film is a visual treat, 90% black & white but with coloration added for artistic purpose in spare amounts.  Its detail and style are unparalleled.  Nobody makes a film like this anymore, nobody ever dared, and it's a miracle the Weinsteins funded this one in the first place.<br /><br />The Canadian blu-ray disc release got alot of positive press when the US version was yet unreleased.  The US version lives up to every expectation and is excellent in every respect.  If you have the DVD version of this film, this is one of the few I insist you upgrade to blu-ray.

5301772,B004SIPA0A, A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q,5.0, No Good Deed Goes Unpunished,"With some 600 reviews extant, I have no idea why I was sent a free copy of this to review, but I have to admit I'm genuinely happy that someone out there likes me.  The subject of this two-disk + graphic novel extravaganza is a film that dramatizes the Sin City graphic novel series written and drawn by Frank Miller.  Miller's storylines are archetypical noir set in a city where it is always night, and the darkest night at that.  People just plain don't come to good ends in Miller's work.<br /><br />The original release weaves four different Miller stores.  The Hard Goodbye is the story of Marv (Mickey Rourke), a not-quite-borderline psychotic, who finds a moment of love only to have the woman killed as she sleeps next to him.  Revenge is slow in coming and not the least bit sweet.  Then there is a tale about Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ex-cop who takes on a child killer and goes to prison for it.  Years later he gets to wrap up the grim loose ends.  The Big Fat Kill finds Dwight (Clive Owen) pitted against a crooked cop (Benicio del Toro) who doesn't know how to stay dead.  Next thing you know all the women of Old Town are in a war. And The Customer Is Always Right is a short that offers little explanation but somehow brings the story together.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez's direction is brilliant.  Rather than remake Miller's artwork, he sets out to match it stroke for stroke.  This is one of those rare films where an adaptation of an artist's work is the next best thing.  Deft use of black and white with vivid splashes of color, capture the original's intensity, the framing and scene setting are inspired, and the casting is outstanding.  Even if you are put off by all the violence, sex, and harsh language, you will have to admit that as a piece of film work, Rodriguez has recreated Sin City perfectly.<br /><br />I prefer the original film to the recut and extended version though.  The original interweaves the stories, which gives the view not only a better sense of timing, but also highlights the connections between the stories.  In the newer version you experience the stories one at a time, and while this may make things easier to follow, the common threads in this film about the price of vengeance in a lonely world don't come through as effectively.  The interviews, commentary, and other extras are quite good, though, so this is definitely the version to buy.",Sin City
5301773,B004SIPA0A, A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,5.0, Truly the ultimate Sin City experience,"It's always a thrill to see a movie get the DVD treatment it deserves, and Frank Miller's Sin City: Recut - Extended - Unrated is a really fantastic package loaded to the gills with all kinds of good stuff.  If you're a Sin City fan, you'll want to just take a day off and indulge yourself in this ultimate Sin City experience - and it will take you the better part of a day to watch and go through everything this little box holds.  Even if you bought the regular DVD when it came out, I really think you'll want to upgrade to this special edition.<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with Frank Miller and his series of Sin City graphic novels.  When I first saw trailers for the film, all I knew was that Jessica Alba was in it, and that was reason enough for me to want to see it.  When you don't know Miller's work, the trailers for the film are hard to get your head around.  You're intrigued by the unique look of the film, with all the dark, gritty backgrounds and the selective use of color in certain scenes, but it isn't easy to figure out what the film is about, exactly.  When you do sit down and watch the film, you're just blown away: the whole look of the film is absolutely mesmerizing, unlike anything you've seen before; the cast is just full of one huge star after another turning in dazzling performances; the stories are dark and haunted and just draw you right in; but it's the characters most of all that captivate you.<br /><br />The film is really four stories assembled into one finished product.  The Customer is Always Right is a short introduction for what is to come - and then Marv takes over.  Marv is one of the most fascinating characters to come along in years.  He's a huge, ugly guy, a thug and killer you can't help but like and respect - and Mickey Rourke is simply amazing in the role.  Marv has the night of his life with a gorgeous woman named Goldie (Jaime King), then wakes up to find her dead.  Framed for the crime, Marv swears to find Goldie's killer, and he lets nothing stand in his way.  Even if it means dying, he's not going to back out - just because Goldie was nice to him.  There's plenty of violent action in this story, and Elijah Wood is surprisingly good as Kevin, an almost superhuman killer who eats his victims.  Then we're off to The Big Fat Kill, where Clive Owen and Benecio Del Toro steal the show, along with Devon Aoki as the beautifully lethal Miho.  She dishes out a lot of graphic violence, including a most excellent beheading.  Alexis Bledel lights up the screen with eyes you could dive right in to.  There's a fair bit of dark comedy in this one, including one incredibly funny bit you won't want to miss.  Finally, there's the story of Hardigan and little Nancy Callahan, a girl that good cop Hardigan saved from a brutal rapist/murderer before having the tables turned completely over on him.  Skinny little Nancy grew up strong and drop-dead gorgeous (like I said, I would buy the movie just for Jessica Alba), but she's still in danger - and only Hardigan can save her from That Yellow Bastard (basically a yellow Ferengi thanks to the damage Hardigan did to him eight years earlier -it's not easy regrowing a set of family jewels, you know - those side effects are brutal).  Bruce Willis is masterful as the tough and gritty yet sensitive Hardigan.<br /><br />It's impossible to truly describe these stories - you just have to see them for yourself.  The performances are so darn good that this movie actually gets better every time you watch it - and this special edition DVD gives you plenty of chances to do just that.  Along with the original theatrical release, you get the uncut version of the movie, split up into four separate, independent chapters; there's some 23 minutes of extra footage - including a couple of scenes that really help embellish the storylines.  You get two commentaries (one with co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, the other with Rodriguez, Quentin Tarentino, and Bruce Willis).  My favorite version features a recording of the Austin premier audience reaction; the depth of the dark comedy in these stories didn't really hit me full force until I was able to join in with that live audience atmosphere.  As if all that isn't enough, though, you also get a series of great featurettes.  Herein is where you truly learn to appreciate the film.  The vast majority of the actual filming was done in front of a green screen, and many of the actors who performed in the same scenes never even met.  And it was all filmed very quickly - all those great backdrops and that unique atmosphere made with CGI.  It's incredible to see just how this movie was shot and put together.<br /><br />There's nothing else out there remotely like Sin City.  It truly makes Frank Miller's comic come to life - for the most part, the movie mirrors the graphic novels themselves almost frame by frame.  Director Robert Rodriguez calls this an anti-movie; in a sense, Miller actually drew his comics in such a way that they could never be filmed.  Rather than adapt the graphic novels to film, Rodriguez went the other way - he adapted the film format to the graphic novels.  When you look at the movie in comparison to the books (and you get a copy of The Hard Goodbye with this DVD package), you'll see exactly what he means.  Sin City is truly an unparalleled, 100% complete success.  I just can't get enough of it.",Sin City

This is the next wave of cinema and i couldn't be more pleased. Rodriguez proves he is among the most talented directors working.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is the standout. He really deserves an Oscar nomination(and the Oscar) for his role as Marv. In all that makeup he manages to make this character so REAL.<br /><br />Bruce Willis also exceeds expectations. Great role for him.<br /><br />Clive Owen supplies plenty of dry wit in a send-up performance of would be action heros. You have to really see the humor in Brittany Murphy's performance. Her role is purposely over the top and high camp, excellent job. Rosario Dawson is right on the money as the diva with some serious weaponry.

5301775,B004SIPA0A, AJU575VNG3ABM,5.0, One of my favorite movies,"I loved this movie. When I saw it in the theatre, I loved it. So, naturaly when it came out on dvd, I had to have it. Lots of gore, great story, loads of action, the characters. I could go on and on. It's just fantastic.",Sin City
5301776,B004SIPA0A, A2KAOY6VB9ZAOW,4.0, Almost perfect movie for 2005,"I'll have to admit movies as of late have either been huge successes or major failures. You could say over the last 5 years maybe only 3 to 4 movies a year really stand out in people's minds, out of the hundreds of releases per year. This is bad, since movie ticket prices have risen quite a bit over the last few years too, making it hard for us to sleep at night after dishing out the coin for a crappy flick.<br /><br />Finally, though, Sin City came out. After seeing a teaser trailer on TV, I was instantly interested in seeing this movie. The trailer seemed made perfectly to attract the way-ward movie goers into seeing something, finally, worth seeing. I had no fore-knowledge before gonig to see this movie. I had not read any of the graphic novels from Miller and had no idea what any of the characters were like. I was imopressed with how well all of the characters were introduced and explained. The twisting sotry-lines did not take away anything from the over-al flow of the movie.<br /><br />As far as the black and white with hint of color(only at special times) was a great idea. Artisticlly it was a great turn for a graphic comic translation. Where as the Hulk, just plain made me cry when I saw it. Comic book movies have been a huge hit over the last 3 years. Startnig with X-Men back in 2000 then going to Spider Man, X2 and Spider Man 2 as well. Although Sin City isn't as big a commercial success as Spider Man or X-Men, the movie is sure to draw people to the name Sin City.<br /><br />If there is one flaw with this movie, I'd say the story is a bit drawn out in some places. And there is a bit of confusion at some points which make you stratch your head in wonder, but it does not take away anything from the over-all flow of the movie.<br /><br />Sin City is a great movie of 2005, right up there with Batman Begins and Star Wars Ep 3. Take a view of this one, it shall stand out.",Sin City

Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino in the directors' chairs along with Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson, etc etc on screen the only special feature Dimension can muster is one featurette??

5301779,B004SIPA0A, A2NBOL825B93OM,5.0, Sin,"Author Frank Miller and director Robert Rodriguez bring to the big screen one of the most explicit, violent and character-driven graphic novels of recent years.  Based on solid performances by a bunch of hot-shot actors (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Rutger Hauer, among others), and with author Frank Miller giving the proper assistance to Rodriguez, ""Sin City"" is a masterpiece of noir atmosphere, since the very first scene to the apocalyptic and self-destructing ending.<br /><br />Violence fills every scene. The monochromatic, grayish shots are almost claustrophobic, and the violence depicted is so effective that you expect a splat of blood or a loose bullet to strike you in the audience.<br /><br />There are three ""Sin City"" stories in this movie, that somewhat come togheter at the end. The first one is about Jim Hartigan (Bruce Willis) an aging, close-to-retirement cop that investigates a series of rape-murder-kills, only to discover that the murderer is a very influent person. The second story features an almost irrecognizeable Mickey Rourke - the best actor in the movie -, a sort of unstoppable super-hero-like character, trying to avenge the murder of the only woman that gave herself up to him without charging anything. And the third story is about how Dwight and Johnny-Boy have a curious meeting that may break up the ballance between the hookers, the Mob and the Police in Basin City dark alleys.<br /><br />The direction, the final computer art and the casting is so good that I almost expected to see the text baloons coming out of the character's mouths in the screen. Great effort, great result.<br /><br />Grade 9.0/10",Sin City

An instant classic, like  Pulp Fiction on mescaline but at the same time standing by itself as possibly the best comic book adaptation. I have all the confidence in the world saying that because watching this film is like watching the graphic novel come to life. You hear critics say that about countless adaptations, but with this one, that statemant is about as literal as it gets.<br /><br />The city itself is amazingly constructed, the characters are legendary and lovable, just about every one of them's bad news and has some sort of psychological defect, whether its delusional psychosis, Mania, or Sadism or all three or even more. The story and dialouge arent necessarily original or even serious, but its not really meant to be, this film is a valentine to the noir and pulp comics of the golden age. The cinematography is as brilliant as it is beautiful. I truly can't describe at all how great it all is, you just have to sit down and take it all in for yourself, though not recommended for the kiddies, since each scene is riddled with ultra-violence and T&A galore.<br /><br />quite simply, a movie miracle, 'nuff said...",Sin City

Bruce willis is as always a tough badass. Mickey Rourke made his come back. He did a great job playing Marv. A criminal who is in love with Goldie who was killed, therefore he tries to find who killed her. Bruce willis is an old cop who tries to save a young girl. Even after many years when this girl was in danger, he still tries to help her out. Clive owen is the next big thing. He did a great job. He tries to help a waitress and goes after a guy who was bothering her. the guy will end up dying, but it is found that he is a cop and many problems bagin from then onwards. All the three stories are well done and unite at one point, because it s a Sin City and all the crazy things are happening there. Totally would suggest to every one to go and check it out!!!",Sin City

You'll absolutely hate it.<br /><br />Being a fan of Frank Miller's for over 15 years (i'm 24) and a huge fan of Sin City for about 8 years I was totally pleased with this movie.  I have never seen a movie based off a comic done better. (Ghost World comes close, though).",Sin City

I just got back from seeing it with my girlfriend she hated it but I dont care cause Ive sat through the crappy movies that she makes me see and I hated them so yea and I liked it.  I didnt really know anything about Sin City because I never read the books, but when I saw the trailer to it I was like Im so seeing it.  Really awesome movie.  Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Marley Shelton, Lisa Marie Newmyer, Patricia Vonne, Chelsea Bulte, Penny Drake, Lauren-Elaine Edleson, Natalie Hess, Ashley Moore, Sherrell Murphy-Ramos, and Katherine Willis are hot.",Sin City
5301785,B004SIPA0A, A3JXVV1QJ68PAX,5.0, For all the bad reviews,"The is a freakin' awesome movie. Before you go into this movie a few things need to be said. First off, this isn't a date movie (unless you have a really kewl girlfriend like I do) and this isn't a movie for kids. (I wouldn't recommend parents of kids under the age of 17 taking their kids to see this movie.) This is not your typical comic book, this is a graphic novel. It is filled with gratuitous violence and nudity. At the same time this is the most faithful comic book/graphic novel adaptation ever put to the big screen and it's made only better by that fact.<br /><br />Let me tell you, I didn't go into this movie as a fanboy of the Sin City comic book. I went into this as a fan of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. (I'm one of those people who is more of a fan of the film makers than the stars who act in their films.) Two days before I picked up the first book in the series, The Hard Goodbye, and started reading it. I must say I enjoyed what I had read thoroughly before seeing the movie as I followed Marv through his search for the b@st@rds who killed the only woman who ever loved him. I went to the theater on opening day, and was just blown away as I watched the exact same thing, frame for frame as I had just read in the graphic novel.<br /><br />Style is the first thing everyone talks about when dealing with this movie. Sure, it's in black and white, but the splashes of color mixed with the black and white give you a new way to look at the dingy world of Basin City. (This movie is after all Frank Miller's depiction of Hollywood.) Also the lack of color does also dim the violence a tad bit, but the style is stunning none the less.<br /><br />I have seen too many reviews downing the acting and dialogue of this movie. According to one reviewer, ""The acting was horrendous."" But then again that actor was a 15 year old, who I'm sure knows nothing of where this style of acting comes from. Most of the people who give this movie bad reviews know nothing of true cinema, only the popcorn crap that we call movies nowadays. Crap like The Day After Tomorrow, or Freddy Vs. Jason and crap like that. The style of acting that is used in this movie was originated in the film noir movies of the 30's 40's and 50's. It's supposed to be slightly overacted and cheesy. Among the best in this movie are Mickey Rourke as the aforementioned Marv, and a brilliant Benicio Del Toro as a crooked cop who seems to somewhat enjoy a very interesting car ride with Clive Owen in the one scene directed by Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br />This movie does not have a linear plot by the way. And the characters are only brought together by a mutual friend/enemy/relative. The movie is based off of 3 of the first four novels, and are tied together quite well despite not having a major character running between each segment.<br /><br />All in all, anyone who is a fan of Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Kill Bill 1 and 2, From Dusk Till Dawn, Pulp Fiction, and/or Reservoir Dogs should see this movie. Not only should you see this movie, you should see it while it's on the big screen, it's only going to loose some of it's luster on the small scree. Not much, but the image won't quite be the same.",Sin City
5301786,B004SIPA0A, ABR07M997480C,5.0, Sin City,"I saw this yesterday and I was not disappointed.  I loved every minute; my favorite of the three stories was The Hard Goodbye.  I read the comics and Mickey Rourke did an excellent job as Marv.  It was like I was reading the comics all over again it was amazing the way that they put the books on screen.  The cast in this was amazing Jessica Alba as Nancy, Elijah Wood as the sick and twisted killer Kevin, Bruce Willis as the troubled cop Hartigan, Benicio del Toro, Jamie King as Goldie, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy as Bencio's ex girlfriend, Clive Owen as her new boyfriend, Josh Hartnett as the assassin, Devin Aoki as Miho, Alexis Bledel as Becky (I loved her eyes), Frank Miller did appear in this as a priest, all in all I loved the cast.  Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller did an excellent job I have never seen anything truer to a book before.<br /><br />This is NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN.  There is some nudity, cannibalism, a lot of violence, and swearing.",Sin City
5301787,B004SIPA0A, A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y,5.0," ""Sin City"" Blew Even My Extremely High Expectations Away","I just got back from seeing Sin City in a sold out theater and everyone walking out was talking about the many memorable scenes and performances. Mickey Rourke absolutely stole the show as Marv. Not only was his character the best of an amazing bunch of interesting folk throughout the film, but his story was also the strongest of the three. Other major standouts would have to be Elijah Wood in a silent, yet creepy role as the serial cannibal named Kevin, Bruce Willis as one of the few characters in the movie that proves to be more on the good side of right and wrong, Benicio Del Toro (great casting choice here: 2nd Best Performance Behind Rourke's Marv), Nick Stahl as a less creepy, but still effective version of a Kevin like pyscho, and Devon Aoki as the silent killer for the prostitutes. Now those are just the many standouts to me in a cast with only one semi-weak performance turned in by Brittany Murphy (but by her standards this is a decent one). There are also plenty of lovely ladies for guys like me to drool over, especially Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino who shows off her immaculate body. The visual look of the film is stunning of course and the direction is perfect. The violence might seem a little excessive, but it is so over the top that you will not be able to turn away. Great dialogue that stays true to the source and mananged to get the crowd I saw it with to chuckle at least a dozen times (better than most comedies I have seen of late). All in all, if you are of the male gender and you have not made plans to see this film this weekend, please stop reading this review and get to your local theater pronto. Sin City is a place I will be visting a couple more times before it leaves the big screen.",Sin City

5301790,B004SIPA0A, A2PIX2K56IZZYX,5.0, Easily the best of 2005.................,"2005 has not been a banner year for movies, if I have to sit through one more super-hero movie I think I'm gonna puke. Between big Hollywood bombs and remake after remake, you can imagine the joy I received from watching this incredible movie. About as flawless as a movie can be this is film-making at it's best. I am not very familiar with Frank Miller and his 'graphic' novels, but I am very tempted to do some serious catching up with the man!!<br /><br />Have you ever seen a movie with so many a-list actors in your life? and here is what really surprised me, some of these actors generally make crappy movies (Brittany Murphy) but they all shine  here, big time. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke get the most screen time and both excell mightily, I'm sure it won't happen but some oscar consideration for best actor should be considered for either if not both. Willis is at his best as a cop with a bad heart feeling his age trying to do good by his one true love, Jessica Alba, who plays a stripper with a big heart. She also is great in this, and thank god, because she followed this with 'Fantastic 4' why Jessica, why? Mickey Rourke, who I have always enjoyed, even in some of his more poor movies, is just stunning here, he plays this so well, he makes sure you will be thinking of this character weeks after you've seen it. I have now seen this three times and his portrayal of a man fighting all kinds of inner demons, not to mention a serial killer and a corrupt priest  (played very well and very creepy by Rutger Hauer) is something I'll never forget.<br /><br />Clive Owen is 3rd in the depth chart, but what a job he does, and I think he needed this, it makes people forget he did the awful 'King Arthur' he plays a cop trying to save his lady from a real low-life of a man played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro. I mean this man is such a total sleaze-bag, and Del Toro absolutely hams it up, I'm guessing he had a blast playing this role. Brittany Murphy, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, is pretty solid as Owen's girlfriend. This is the same woman who did 'Little Black Book' and 'Uptown Girls' so this was a welcome change, hopefully this will help her pick better roles in the future, cuz' she is very attractive and really not that bad of an actress.<br /><br />Moving on, some of the smaller roles are some of the best. Now this may seem strange to most, but I think Elijah Wood (yes, Frodo) should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He does not say a word, but his performance as the serial killer is down right scary. The facial expressions he uses are sinister and perfectly timed, you watch they way he ""meets his maker"" and tell me that didn't make the hair on your neck stand right up!!! Devon  Aki is Meho, another who does not say a word, but is enchanting, until she whips out of of her many weapons and does some really not so nice things to alot of bad men. This was followed by D.E.B.S. Devon.......again, why?<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is sexy as hell as Gail, one of Clive Owen's former flings, she too is a bad-ass and Nick Stahl is the son of senator Power's Boothe, both are scum-bags, but Stahl is just nasty, nasty, nasty. His scenes with Willis and Alba towards the end are sensational to say the least. Michael Madsen, Alexis Bledel, and Carla Gugino also co-star, and like I said earlier, all contribute in one way or another.<br /><br />My only tiny, and I mean very tiny, complaint is Michael Clarke Duncan, he is very unbelievable and his role lacked the edge and depth of every other character, so this is two poor showings in a row from him, as he was really bad in 'Daredevil' but no big deal as most of that movie was atrocious.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez, for the most part, is a visually gifted director, he has a special way of showcasing violence in a stylized way that few can compare with.'Desperado' is one of my all time favorites and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one of the better horror vampire movies ever made. Although I have not seen any of the 'Spy Kids' movies, I know from there commercial success and with talking to alot of kids that atleast the first two are very well done. So it's a real shame that I recently heard that his latest kids fare, 'Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl' was such a flop.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this movie, it is hands down the best of the year, and I really hope it is not forgotten around academy awards season. This is expertly acted and directed, and is simply one of the best-looking movie's I can remember. I hear there is a new version coming out, with extended scenes and the infamous ""not rated"" tag. So you can bet I'll be first in-line when the date is announced.<br /><br />acting.............5 stars, Rourke and Willis amaze, so does the rest<br /><br />directing..........5 stars, Rodriguez is so gifted<br /><br />special effects....5 stars, Not over-done, perfectly timed.<br /><br />action rating......5 stars, Amazing gun-fights, great chase scenes, suspense and a few one-liners thown in as well<br /><br />quality............5 stars, If I could give higher I would, incredible looking movie, no grain, no gliches, flawless!!!",Sin City

5301801,B004SIPA0A, A106016KSI0YQ,3.0," Black and white, and red all over","Robert Rodriguez is very clear in the helpful ""making of"" featurette that accompanies this DVD that he didn't want to bring his own vision of Frank Miller's famous 1990s graphic novels to the screen, but rather reproduce Miller's  vision as exactly as possible. Rodriguez formulates his cinematographic vision so carefully to the stunning black-and-white designs of Miller's stories that the live-action shots at times suggest exceptional animation, particularly in the film's early visual highpoints, a series of physical hand-to-hand battles between the hulking avenger Marv (Mickey Rourke) and the preppy ninja/serial killer Kevin (Elijah Wood) in a rainy midnight farmscape. Miller even advised the actors on their parts and took such a hand in the filming that Rodriguez wanted to give Miller sole directing credit when the Directors' Guild of America refused to list their names together; when Miller refused to take sole credit, Rodriguez resigned from the Directors' Guild so both their names could appear together.<br /><br />Like Zack Snyder's recent popular film version of Miller's THE 300, this is about as faithful a translation of Miller's graphic-novel vision to the screen as could be imagined. Miller's own layouts and storytelling is so cinematic that it translates gorgeously onto the screen. And, as with THE 300, the violence is so over-the-top and cartoonish its almost impossible to be offended by it. The great gushing fluids that come out of the characters here is not only ridiculously copious but at likely to be white or black (or, with one character, yellow) as it is red. More than anything else, this is an extended and gorgeous exercise in style. It takes what was once held as an offshoot of realism -- the Mickey Spillane-style noir detective fiction -- and spins out all its most baroque excesses to show its theatricality and artifice. All the adult women are gorgeous prostitutes or strippers; all the villains want to prey on little girls or innocents (sometimes literally); the heroes' eventual Jacobean punishments for their foes are as imaginatively and grimly excessive as possible. As gorgeous and florid as this all is, though, it's hard at times to see its point. None of the characters are real at all: their two-dimensionality is of course an absolute given of the story's artistic premises. And while the grotesque tortures and killings initially shock, through extended repetition they begin to lose any sort of effect on your senses. After a while all you can do is react to the visual beauty of the compositions, and even that gets a bit dulled after a while. Probably this would have made an extremely effective (and equally gorgeous) short film.",Sin City

If a depressing, violent world with ambigious heroes and crime and corruption isn't your thing, you'll definitely like it even less with Sin City's stylized visuals and heightened gore, sexuality, and skewed morality. For everyone else though, this is definitely one of the more memorable films in recent years, and turns the genre of comic book adaptations into an artform. An all-star ensemble cast is directed by Robert Rodriguez (with Quentin Tarantino!) against a green screen studio set, bringing to life Frank Miller's acclaimed graphic novel series. It's a fantastic mix of the technical and creative, and leaves you wanting more after the film's finished.<br /><br />The recut, extended, unrated, etc. etc. dvd collectors edition is both good and bad. The bad is that recut and extended doesn't really amount to much, and you'll definitely feel cheated if you go in expecting a radically different film (though you can watch all the stories individually now). The good is that like the other Rodriguez dvds, this one's loaded with great bonus features. You know, the kind that's informative, fun to watch, and isn't promotional fluff. Plus the package comes with a digest sized version of ""The Hard Goodbye"" so you can compare the film to the source material.

Everything works like going from picture frame to picture frame. Even the color and dialog mimics the simplistic style and phrasing from a comic book.<br /><br />The movie is very violent but, this work is adapted from a very violent graphic novel. The violence should not surprise anybody. This is hardly for children.<br /><br />The stories are fun and suspensful. You will root for teh hero and wish nothing but pain for the villains.<br /><br />The best performance is from Micky Rourke playing a very violent thug that also has as soft place in his heart for women. He portrays the toughest SOB I have ever seen in film. I love the electric chair scene.<br /><br />This is a very daring, adventerous yet arty movie that worked, It should not be taken seriously.<br /><br />Other movies tried to be like a comic book (Dick Tracey, Batman, Superman) but this actually accomplishes it. The others are comic book inspired flicks butthis is actually a moving visualization of a comic book.<br /><br />This gets an A+ for the artistic effect and a B+ for the movie content.",Sin City

It was what it was, as it was. And what there was, was damn cool. I liked the style and the stories. Stark, grim, gritty, desolate. Not the kind of thing I'd watch before going to bed, but reaching down into the viscera and doing some twisting and making you wonder what dark urges and impulses lurk inside yourself. Asking some troubling questions maybe. Very violent, but<br /><br />I'm all for that kind of stuff, and while for others the `comic' connection may be what turns them on, for me it's the revelatory character of it all. That should be sufficient to make it worthwhile for those who, like me, can handle material like the Fables series and Y, but shy back from other graphic stories, like Frank Miller's.<br /><br />My favorite of the stories is `That Yellow Bastard'. To me it's the most poignant and visceral. I'm sure other people have other favorites, but that's cool.  This is one of those flicks that can be a lot of things to a lot of people.

5301814,B004SIPA0A, A15MPXKU6SXLES,4.0, If You Like Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction - You Will Like This,"Let me start off by saying, I have never read the books/comics this movie is based on AND I had read all the hype about this movie. WARNING: This is a VERY violent, bloody movie like the ones mentioned in the title.<br /><br />Having seen some trailers and clips on the review shows I kind of knew what to expect. I thought the style was quite interesting, black and white with touches of color. The narrative style reminded me of some of the old private eye radio shows. There were some that had a problem w/the way the women were depicted but I figured a movie called Sin City probably didn't have too many saintly figures, female OR male.<br /><br />The opening vignette was surprising, but probably the only relatively bloodless scenes in the movie. The blood spewing goes up from there. The story is told in several vignettes and the characters overlap into subsequent stories. Let me say the violence is relentless. There were several times during the movie I had to pause it to take a break. About 2/3 of the way through I told my husband I had seen about enough. I listened and glanced at the rest of the movie while cleaning up the kitchen. There were some interesting stories. I did not mind the voice over. I did wonder what the deal was with the Mickey Rourke character that could not seem to die, but you never found out (maybe the books/comics explain this). I just went with it and it did not bother me, just curious about him.<br /><br />I think this kind of movie probably does not require phenomenal acting skills, since the characters are comic-book-like and the stories come off that way too. I very rarely watch violent movies, especially if there is gratuitous, unnecessary violence (Jason movies, HellRaiser), but I can appreciate the stylized, unusual look of the film and the stories vignettes were interesting.",Sin City
5301815,B004SIPA0A, ASQCOPVGGU6TO,5.0, ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"I have been a huge fan of these kinds of movies for quite some time. I just love the gritty style it brings. The raw violence and the thick plotlines. Sin City is an amazing piece of work. Rodriguez brings the comic book to life beautifully and Frank Millers writing of the books is just out of this world. I strongly recommend you see this film. Not recommended for children or persons with weak stomachs though. Cannot wait for Sin City 2. Hope it comes out soon as has the same deliverance as the first one. This new recut edition just had to be made. I don't think I could live with the vanilla edition which I bought in August 2005. Once i saw this edition being released i sold the other one and bought this one. The special features are amazing however the new scenes hardly add anything to the movie. They certianly don't take anything away from the theatrical release. Also, the whole Tarantino as a special guest director is a little ridiculous, although i love all of his other movies. Its clear to figure out the one scene he directed.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a fantastic movie. Get out and see it now!!!!!!!!!!!!",Sin City
5301816,B004SIPA0A, A303IXEFASLHN4,5.0, Excellent movie!! Highly Entertaining and STYLISH!,"I rate this movie 4&1/2 stars. The movie surrounds 3 major story lines that is not your typical linear film but does eventually connect,  like Pulp Fiction or Go. I first saw this movie with low expectatcions due to all the negative vibe surrounding the film from word of mouth. Some of these critics are much too hard on films that is not meant to be taken seriously!! It's a comic book movie with an ultra violent tone and is not for everyone. If you like movies like Fight Club, Four Rooms, Desperado, Pulp Fiction, I think you will not be disappointed. What are we all so politically correct that we have to set proper guidelines to make it a good movie?  The tone of the movie is very well done with the scenery of the set, the black and white vintage feel with emphasis of color on eyes, lips and other features that I feel are important characteristics that bring out the characters and style.  The mood and music is very well done! Also an extremely good all star cast for the film.  Jessica Alba is supper hot, and so is Rosario Dawson in this film.  5 stars on the film scoring for Robert Rodriguez.  One of the best films of 2005 for sure!!",Sin City

The film itself contains the rare but measured ingredients of a true classic comic. What the viewer discovers is a crimson colored, black and white film jam packed with live action, special effect and and electrically charged 1950's comic drama from beginning to end. The extraordinary and exciting talents of Bruce Willis, Powers Booth, Michael C. Duncan and Rutger Hauer are further enhanced with the surprising, psychotic appearance of Elijah Wood as an super powered nearly unstoppable maniac. If this combination is not enough, there is yet, one other surprising feature in Sin City which nearly steals the show from all the other actors. This is the superb acting, extraordinary ability and super makeup of the multi-talented Mickey Rourke. Directing this fantastic assemblage of fine actors is multi-talented Robert Rodriguez, who has created in the words of this reviewer, a Cult Classic which will endure far into the future of films.",Sin City

I must stress - I am grateful for that. Watching this movie on a my 42 inch Panasonic Plasma with the DTS soundtrack is one amazing experience. The stories in the movie itself are very captivating - my favourite being the Mickey Rourke character called Marv - this guy was supercool! The stylization in the movie is first class and reminiscent of previous Tarantino/Rodriguez flicks. The movie deserves to watched over and over again for the script, characters and downright super-coolness. As for the DVD transfer - perfect in my eyes- the black and white pictures enhance what little colour there is and especially on a Plasma screen - strikes out at you.

The visual style is unique, probably one of the first films whose images are similar to those in the books.<br /><br />However, the plotting is weak. The four stories that encompass the movie are too short, and when one ends, we immeadiately jump into another one. For a normal film-goer, this could make it a confusing movie.<br /><br />Another draw-back is that the film is just too graphic. Some of the violent images are needless, and seriously detract from the film.<br /><br />The acting is good, though. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Jamie King and Jessica Alba give some of their best performances to date.<br /><br />Overall, this is a strange-but-good film that will mostly appeal to fans of the comic book.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: B",Sin City

They look almost surreally like the characters in the novels. Clive Owen is uncanny, Benicio Del Toro - albeit with a bit of make-eup and prsotethic - looks like the character in the book, Mickey Rourke - in my opinion - needed very little make-up to play Marv, as he's done a fairly good job of messing up his own face all by himself. But he truly steals the show as the daring, revenge-fuelled Marv.<br /><br />All-in-all, the film is mesmerising. Three strange but brilliant stories based in a whore-run, crime-ridden city.

5301825,B004SIPA0A, AT07UZQQR7ZEH,4.0, A very brutal and very stylish film noir,"First of all, this Robert Rodriguez film of Frank Miller's graphic comic books is mostly in B&W, not color as advertised.  This is ideal for the material, but may have accounted for deserted theaters the second week of its release.  It is a brutally violent film noir, co-directed and co-written by Miller and Rodriguez; Rodriguez, who also cut and photographed this baby, wanted a flawless translation of Miller's inky B&W comic book novels.  So, we have a movie that is 90% B&W and incredibly violent.  Let's get that out of the way up front.<br /><br />Basin City at night becomes a nightmare film noir city of awful violence and evil characters, in B&W with dabs of color now and then--a red dress and red bedspread, a woman with gold hair, a zombie with bald gold head, a blue car--in an otherwise B&W landscape.  The art direction and visual effects are stunning and make SIN CITY worth recommending.<br /><br />Rodriguez and Miller basically have three stories to tell that all take place in Basin City at night--(1) Bruce Willis as a retired cop with a bad heart who wants to save exotic dancer Jessica Alba; (2) a heavily made-up Mickey Rourke as a prizefighter out to avenge the death of his beloved girlfriend; and (3) Clive Owen in a very complex tale of Old Town prostitutes and a guy who wants to save one of them from psychopath Benicio Del Toro.<br /><br />You will probably either love or hate SIN CITY, and know which after only five minutes of screen time.  It is exceedingly brutal and nasty, but also has towering production design, stunning visual effects, and unusual characters.  It is the kind of movie that Leonard Maltin can hate, while Ebert & Roeper can give ""Two Thumbs Way Up"" to.  When it opened, the SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE's Mick La Salle gave it ****.  If you like the Frank Miller comic books, you will probably find it a masterpiece.  On a too short behind-the-scenes documentary on the DVD, Miller says he is floored by how faithful Rodriguez is to the source.  That is why Rodriguez brought him on board as co-director, which cost Rodriguez his membership in the Directors Guild.  Things must have deteriorated inside the DGA since Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly co-directed ON THE TOWN (1949) and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952).

When something on the screen was in color, be it red lipstick, white crosses, blue eyes, or whatever, the theater was bathed in that color and it really resonated from the screen. The use of black and white stood out with incredible contrast.<br /><br />At home it just looks like a black-and-white movie with random things in color. Most of the erie effect is lost.<br /><br />That said, I loved it in the theater and still like it okay at home, with some question of whether I should be reviewing my experience of the DVD itself or the movie.",Sin City

Second, they used Mickey Rourke perfectly with the makeup and his build, he was perfect to play the character of Marv.  True, the violence in this film is extreme, but that is a major component of what the graphic novel and the storyteller were attemping to convey - and the film stayed true to that.  The use of color in some scenes was also visually powerful.  I would very much recommend this film for those who are interested in this genre (though I honestly wouldn't know how to classify this one, other than action-drama).  For fans of Jessica Alba, well, you won't be disappointed, either...<br /><br />Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century.

This film is almost impossibly violent, with cannibalism, decapitation, dismemberment, castration, and torture occuring throughout the three major segments. However, anyone who has ever actually read the source material would not complain. The action is frequently over-the-top and unrealistic, but it makes sense when one considers that this is a ""translation"" of Frank Miller's graphic novels. Most of Sin City's dialogue and voiceovers are lifted right out of the comics, as are many individual shots. Three loosely-connected storylines make up the bulk of the film, beginning with ""The Hard Goodbye,"" continuing with ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ending with ""That Yellow Bastard.""<br /><br />The cast is simply excellent: Mickey Rourke brings the thuggish Marv to brutal, excessively-bandaged life; Benicio Del Toro's Jackie Boy exudes half-crazed menace; Nick Stahl's performance as Junior perfectly conveys the character's bratty psychosis. Even non-speaking characters are well-played (Elijah Wood is downright creepy as the murderous Kevin).<br /><br />I really don't understand the accusations of misogyny. Most of the women are strong-willed and powerful, like Gail, Wendy, and Miho. The men of Sin City are almost always portrayed as callous, amoral killers. Well, technically, everyone in Sin City is somewhat lacking in morality. Anyone easily offended by immoral behavior should rent or buy a different movie.",Sin City
5301831,B004SIPA0A, A31D8QKJXU93BT,4.0, Black & White & Red All Over,"Computer graphic images that tell the tales in ""Sin City"" are not unique, as claimed by other reviewers, or even unusual. They've been used before, most recently in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow."" But they have never been executed with the  sophistication that directors Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller and Quentin Tarentino (who directed one scene) display in this pastiche of Miller's comic books --- err, excuse me, ""graphic novels,"" in the parlance used today to elevate the stature of cartoonists by those unaware of the stature cartooning long ago achieved. The trilogy of Miller movies that Rodriguez plans must now be measured against this dazzling mosaic.<br /><br />It won't dazzle everyone, not with its dismemberments and disembowelments, castrations, misogyny (women are trashed or trashy), rampant immorality and corruption. But adventurers will sit transfixed by the three linked stories that pay tribute to film noir, the only way to film Miller. Violence, cynicism and outrageous behavior are his forte. All of the action, acting and direction are over the top and below the belt. ""Sin City"" is as sexual as anything likely to silence you in your seat this year.<br /><br />The stories are of an ailing cop (Bruce Willis) who rescues from a pervert (Nick Stahl) a pubescent girl who grows up to love him, an ugly ruffian (Mickey Rourke) who seeks the killer of a whore who loved him, and the protector (Clive Owen) of a whore (Rosario Dawson) whose gang is under attack by really bad guys. Plot points are resolved in a bath of brutality and bloodshed, exquisitely rendered in black-and-white CG images wed to live actors and accented with bright colors, mostly blood red.<br /><br />Heartthrob Josh Hartnet, a creepy Benecio del Toro and, as a cannibalistic killer, elfin Elijah Wood are in the remarkable cast. This is not an actor's movie. although Willis and Rourke give mature performances and the very British Owen is as hard-boiled as early Burt Lancaster.

My hopes were foiled again and again by the fact that no other 13 year old, (at least one that I know), had seen the film. Five months I waited. Five months I fought for my cause. Finally, after bickering to an extreme, I convinced my mom to at least SEE the movie. Half way in, my hopes were dashed; she walked saying NO WAY. But perserverance was on my side, and I convinced her to sit through the rest. After te most agonizing 45 minutes of my life, she said the words I needed to hear.<br /><br />  I saw this morning and I am here to say...WOW. Now do not take this review the wrong way, I do not suggest this movie for MOST 13 year olds. It was full of gratuitous and, at some points, downright disturbing, violence. If your resume of films you have been allowed to see and have been unfased by include: The Passion of the Christ, Kill Bill Vol. 1, The Patriot and Saving Private Ryan, and your citizenship grades in school are consistently perfect, then PROBABLY, you should be able to see this film. If not, good luck. After all, luck was on my side.<br /><br />  And now: a general review of the film. This film is my personal new favorite film. Not because of the gratuitous violence, but because of its overwhelmingly cool nature. In my opinion, this film is one of the few modern films that is able to show that there is no good without bad, no happy without sad, no justice without SIN.<br /><br />  Sin City is a world in which the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are far worse. Its unrealistic nature and black and white cinematography are the two things that keep the violence in check, and allow some of it to be comical. Some seens are so Robert Rodriguez, and by that I mean fantastical gunplay that brings a smile to your face.

In fact, if this film was shot using traditional color schemes, there's no doubt it would be rated NC-17 because of the violence. That being said, ""Sin City"" is a great ride of a film. It's Chandler-on-steroids, pulpy and over-the-top. The characters say things that no one could ever get away saying, do things that no one could survive doing, and act like no one else would ever act. You can tell the actors involved (especially Rourke, Murphy, Dawson and Owen) are having a great time when they're up on the screen. This movie is every actor's dream, to go overboard, and many of these people are relishing their moment to do so. Also, the look of the film is completely compelling. It is a near perfect comic-to-screen translation, which brings me to the only real flaw of the film: the length. Because it is so faithful to the source material, it goes on for probably ten minutes too long. However, if you let yourself fall into the world that is being created in front of you, you can (and probably will) have a great time. Not for everyone, for sure, but great for the people it's aiming to please.",Sin City
5301837,B004SIPA0A, A21M7JSRRQFC0G,4.0, Ok...Wow,"They had genious advertising for this movie (which is what got me highly intrigued in the first place). The trailer song was hot, and the actual visuals on the trailer were good as well. I'm actually surprised because comic books and these types of movies do not really interest me but there was something that really made me want to see the movie. I'm glad I went to see it. At first when I walked out of the theatre I didn't know what to think, but I realized I really liked the movie. The picture and visuals worked really well. The movie was in black and white, but there were occasional clever uses of color (blue eyes, red lips, yellow face, etc). It was really much like a comic book made to life. I can't imagine how much work this must have taken. Some of the dialogue might have been a little cornballish, but I can imagine this is the case because it seems like this movie was supposed to be set in a different time, so the talking was a bit different. Some people may find it really violent but I didn't. So if you are really put off by violent scenes and such, be cautioned. There are three different stories in this movie... I thought the acting was really well done and I happened to like most of the characters. I think the character that surprised me the most was Elijah Wood's. Elijah Wood plays an unusual character...very much unlike Frodo. Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke also contribute some good acting. Other actors in this movie include Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki and Bruce Willis among many others. A highly attractive cast in this movie which also adds to the glamorous visuals. Most likely you will end up having a favorite character. I'd certainly recommend seeing the film. If you liked the movies Kill Bill, or most movies of that kind, or you are also a comic book fan, then I think you would appreciate it. It's not built like your average Hollywood movie.",Sin City

Beware, as it isn't for the faint of heart, as it contains strong violence but great humor like in Kill Bill. The movie is divided into 3 parts. The first one is concluded at the end. I don't want to give anything away but Bruce Willis plays a cop with a heart problem hunting a pedophile; Mickey Rourke is a BEAST ( he's huge) framed for murder; Clive Owen hunts down crooked cops and tries to save prostitutes from extermination. It's a must see and is original as it is in balck and white with color only appearing at certain moments. Reccomended for anyone that wants to watch a movie that's just absolutely AWESOME!",Sin City
5301839,B004SIPA0A, A3BGMKWUXQDODF,5.0, Breathtaking visuals and great stories.,"Sin City is absolutely phenomenal. The acting is great and very reminiscient of older films, and the film has a dark, edgy, highly stylistic look to it (thanks undoubtedly to the comics, of course). Black and white with instances of color works really well for the film. I love the fact that two of Sin City's chapters (the first and the third one) have enough emotional depth to match their film noir feel. And the second chapter is just a balls-out action flick, and a sort of a nice respite from the other stories. For some it might seem out of place, but it worked great for me.<br /><br />I can't say enough great things about Sin City. It's just that good.",Sin City
5301840,B004SIPA0A, AKB75HRACZIOP,5.0," Brilliant Cinematography, Superb Cast, Top Notch Action","Personally supervised by Quentin Tarantino, Sin City is a masterpiece of cinematography with a perfect cast and action that will put you on the edge of your seat. The movie is primarily in black and white, but only utilizes color for special emphasis (i.e. lips, blood, and the dress a woman is wearing). This original unique style of filming accompanied with a narrative voice allows the viewer to willingly suspend their suspense of disbelief and enter into the world of Sin City. Bruce Willis, who plays Hartigan, is a burnt-out cop that is pushing 60 that saves a 12 year old girl (Jessica Alba) from being raped and killed.  Mickey Rourke, who plays the character of Marv, is a near unstoppable juggernaut man with a vendetta with anyone related to his one-night stand love ""Blondie"". Elijah Wood plays a freakishly fast cannibal psychopath that slashes people with his elongated finger nails -- what an extreme character compared to Wood's Frodo from Lord of the Rings, but he pulls it off perfectly! This was perhaps the best action movie I have seen all year. It's definitely worth paying the hefty price of $8.75 too see Sin City in your local theatre. If you like badass nonstop action, great acting with an engaging plot, and a movie that sets new standards in cinematography, then Sin City is a movie that you will definitely not want to miss!",Sin City
5301841,B004SIPA0A, AZSN1TO0JI87B,5.0, This Is What Movies Are All About,"Look, I'm going to be honest here. There's nothing I can tell you right now, in this review, that you haven't heard before in other reviews. There's also nothing that can be put in print that will ever do justice to this movie. You just have to see it for yourself. ""Sin City"" is simply the most entertaining movie I have ever seen in theaters. No one talked during this movie, that's how engrossing and just plain cool it is.<br /><br />""Sin City,"" inspired by the graphic comics by Frank Miller (who shares directing credits alongside those ""troublemakers"" Robert Rodirguez and Quentin Tarantino) will likely be unlike anything you have ever seen. First off, the movie is gorgeous, shot in stark black and white, with color making a few choice cameo appearances. It's a very violent movie, very over the top. Not only are people shot in the crotch and beheaded rather liberally, but there are two, count 'em, two swirlies! And there's chunks in that soup, people! Talk about down and dirty! The violence reaches a certain point where it becomes surreal and almost comical (much like the ""Evil Dead"" movies) and helps push the movie as the ultimate fantasy that it is. The movie itself jumps around a lot in time (a trademark of Tarantino, you can see where he had his hands in this) and plays out through a variety of seemingly unrelated scenes, that don't appear to link together until the very end. The casting choices were also very interesting. More seasoned actors like Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan and Michael Madsen appear alongside unpredictable and riskier choices like Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl (I'll never look at him the same) and Alex Bledel (TV's ""Gilmore Girls""). Surprisingly, everyone does a convincing job in their roles, even though they are all just support to the real stars: the sex and the violence. Be warned folks, this is not a movie for your children, or even the faint of heart, to see.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is really the ultimate movie-going experience. After you walk away from it, you will find yourself chattering about it endlessly. It leaves a lasting impression, and is destined for mega-cult status. Truly a film you'll need to see over and over again to absorb everything. If over-the-top violence and nudity don't bother you, I promise you will enjoy yourself at this movie. Believe the hype, this is an incredible film.",Sin City

5301844,B004SIPA0A, A2EDZH51XHFA9B,4.0, Unsurpassed in its beauty.,"Sin City (Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, 2005)<br /><br />A lot of people are going to hate Sin City. A lot of people already do, actually, judging by the reactions of the crowd coming out of the theater where I saw it Friday. Yet only three days after its release, it sits (as of this writing) at #112 on IMDB's Top 250, and at least a smattering of critics have praised it. So there are at least a few people getting it.<br /><br />Sin City is old-school film noir. If you're not a big fan of sitting in arthouses watching revivals of old Joseph Cotten films that were just discovered in vaults after being undisturbed for sixty years, you're probably not going to get terribly much out of it. Much of what the critics have criticized in the film, especially the shallowness of the characters, is very much in the style of traditional noir, and as such seemed to me to be strengths, and not weaknesses, of the film. Think of Sin City as an homage to Billy Wilder as much as graphic novel adaptations, and it'll make more sense.<br /><br />All that aside, the one thing the critics have agreed on is the style. And what style it has. Sin City is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in the past decade-- certainly since Begotten, back in 1991. Unlike Begotten, which struck the viewer with its continuing unwillingness to give you a complete picture of what was going on, Sin City revels in clarity. While much of the film's violence is rendered in cut-away drawn shots, as opposed to the live-action carnage one expects from Rodriguez, the sketched-out scenes paradoxically heighten, rather than mask, the brutality. (Don't worry, boys, the nudity is all real, even if it doesn't include Jessica Alba.)<br /><br />From the standpoint of the plot, your best bet is probably to think of Sin City as Pulp Fiction on steroids. Rodriguez juggles the plots in roughly the same way Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction, but without as much parallelism. There's really not much to say about the plots; this is noir. Plot is secondary to style. There are plots, however, rest assured.<br /><br />To try and cover all the actors in this film worth mentioning would take a thousand words in itself. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Nick Stahl head the list for the macho component, and Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, James King, Carla Gugino, Brittany Murphy, and Alexis Bledel get the top billing for the ladies. And I've just scratched the surface. There is a huge amount of starpower in this movie. (When Josh Hartnett and Nicky Katt are that far down in the credits, you know most of the film's budget was spent on the actors, right?) For the most part, the actors do their thing with liveliness, though there are a few stumbling blocks in the road. The biggest of these is Michael Madsen, which came as quite a shock given that only a few months ago I was praising him to the heavens for making Kill Bill vol. II such a pleasurable experience. A number of parts are overacted, but once again, it's expected in noir. Mickey Rourke, especially, chews scenery in a way that hasn't been seen much since Charlton Heston stopped being a rugged male lead.<br /><br />Simply put, you'll either love it or hate it. How did you feel about the original version of The Desperate Hours? If, like me, you thought it was both William Wyler and Humphrey Bogart's best work, you're probably going to get a real kick out of Sin City. If you thought it was boring and overacted, well, you get the idea. Me, I'd sit through it again right now, if I weren't sitting here writing reviews. ****",Sin City

5301847,B004SIPA0A, A2PN7Z2VTHICL8,5.0, Eye candy that tastes like Pain...Yummy!,"One of the best movies of 2005, Sin City has action, horror, and spectacular visuals; all you need is a strong stomach and a twisted sense of humor.  I've never read the graphic novels, so I won't be doing a comparison to those, just a review from a happy moviegoer who loves it when style and substance meld together to form a visual treat like Sin City.<br /><br />The plot is simply mayhem and revenge, cops and criminals, in a dark world of concrete and sin.  There's lots of blood, Tarentino style, but most of it is in black-and-white so it cuts down on the squishiness.  The plot is not what you want to buy this movie for.  Buy it for the absolutely spectacular and stylized photography and visuals, and the stunning performances of the cast.<br /><br />Bruce Willis aptly and perfectly plays Hartigan, with his ""Diehard-deadpan"" style.  Mickey Rourke is legend in Sin City as Marv, I doubt you will recognize him at first.  The hardest, baddest, meanest, toughest, most vile criminal on the streets, and someone you can root for.<br /><br />Clive Owen (King Arthur) puts his arrogantly serious handsomeness to work as Dwight, a man not to be messed with.  Dwight's Valkyrie, Rosario Dawson (Kids, Alexander) as Gail, gives a stellar (and stimulating) performance in naughty lingerie and a deadly attitude.  Benicio Del Toro (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, Traffic) is excellent as Jackie Boy, a bad cop with a bad heart and a bad attitude.<br /><br />Nick Stahl (Bully, Terminator 3) is awesome.  If you liked him in Bully, you will love him in Sin City as Roark Jr, later to become the golem-like yellow freak.<br />And who can ever get enough of Rutger Hauer? (Blade Runner, Flesh and Blood, Ladyhawke, The Hitcher, etc)  Not me.  I love Rutger, and as Cardinal Roark, those deadly, cold, ice-blue eyes are soulfully used.<br />Elijah Wood (LOTR, Final Destination, The Faculty) is excellent as the psychotic, creepy Kevin; a part that you can just tell Elijah had fun with.  Jessica Alba (Dark Angel) can't act, but doesn't have to in the pretty part of Nancy.  Hats off to Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, The Scorpion King) as Manute and Devon Aoki as Miho.<br /><br />Sin City uses voice-over narration, a third party telling of the action you watch on the screen.  This movie is as good with the sound off as it is with the sound on.  Filmed mostly in black-and-white, the photography is reminiscent of Schindler's List, though 'List' used only one small splash of color and Sin City uses a bit more, the use of color is still limited to such minute and clever spatterings that the impact is still heavily felt.<br /><br />Using over-the-top violence, impossible feats of heroism, strength, agility, and prowess (Watch for Marv's driving scene and Miho's flying archery) and some very black humor, Sin City achieves a horror aficionado's Zen-like state of almost-nirvana.<br /><br />Really, forget the plot.  It's the photography, cast, acting, FX, costumes, stylization, props, and atmosphere that, alone, bring Sin City to five stars and beyond.  Sin City is a must-buy movie.  Enjoy!",Sin City
5301848,B004SIPA0A, AWBS5D7SI70S,4.0, GULP........FICTION,"One of the sad realizations i have come to in the recent years of movie production (and a possible reason ticket sales are at an all time low as of late) is found in Hollywood creativity and new ideas. Sadly, there just isn't any, and if you think Movies are lacking fresh ideas, turn on the TV set after reading this review, but i digress.<br /><br />In my years of movie watching i have enjoyed a variety of movies that set the standard in regards to their genre of story telling. For example as far as star sagas and wars are concerned nothing will likely come close to Star Wars, as far as horror in space, ALIEN might well have the title there, demon possession, one only need watch the Exorcist in the dark alone, where the battle of man against machine, i guess is a throw up between Terminator and The Matrix. Such movies have set the bar relatively high with the quality of their stories; thus leaving other movies with similar topics often to seem like cheap imitators. (Now to all you people who are saying get to the point, the movie review)<br /><br />For quite a while i would have easily said that Pulp Fiction set the bar pretty high in regards to the brand of producing that had multiple stories all tied together. However, it would appear that Sin City took a great idea and just made it better. This movie takes a style of talk and feel of the 30's, mixed colorization of the 60's, violence and sex of...... well pick a year I'm sure it will fit, and the special affects of the 90's and beyond, and rolls it all together into a visual masterpiece. In this movie you will see Mickey Rourke play one of his best roles ever as Marv. Sadly (although i love his work) Bruce Willis play his traditional role of the down and out cop who breaks the rules to save the day (he played it well in this movie but not really a stretch for him) and although his role was small, the most mesmerizing role might well be found in a Fine Young Cannibal named Kevin (Elijah Wood) (sorry for the spoiler).<br /><br />The one fine point i liked about Pulp Fiction was in the Karma to be found within the story, in that in the end everyone pretty much gets what they deserve and that sometimes the people we believe to be good really ain't so good at all, and it takes a unique, sometimes nasty form of justice to make things right. Such a point touched on in Pulp, is the center of SIN CITY in a nutshell.<br /><br />Is it the best movie ever?........no, but it may be one of the best of its kind. If you are the type that can't appreciate the story, just go into it for the sheer artistic and creative value this movie presents and i think you will be moderately pleased. Oh if you didn't already know this movie is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The only disappointing aspect after watching this movie is knowing i might have to wait another 5 to 10 years for another fresh idea to come out of Hollywood to set a new standard and make me want to return to the theaters.<br /><br />P.S. Hollywood Moguls looking for a fresh idea (A Marv prequel)",Sin City

He was able create a film that is visually stunning, brutal, humorous, grotesque, violent and yet beautiful and heartwarming.  It's love and redemption in the gutter.<br /><br />The negative reviews I've read here are either by fans protesting the release of this ""bare bones"" edition, or by pantywaists who don't seem to get that film violence can be artistic, humorous, surreal and entertaining.  From what I've read here, this film does not appeal to old school feminazis (The 80s are over, honey. Shave your legs) and Canadians.  I guess our friends to the north just don't have the stomachs for the strong stuff.<br /><br />If you're still on the fence, just remember that this is a comic movie, the action and dialogue are going to be over-the-top, surreal and at times slapstick. But this is a comic movie for adults. If you're expecting Spiderman or The Fantastic Four, save your money.  But if you can appreciate the beauty and grandeur of The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings and Spiderman, but also get a chuckle from the over-the-top violence of Scarface, Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Hell, I'll buy BOTH DVD versions.",Sin City

With it's black and white filming, the unique use of certain colors such as red for blood and lipstick to accent certain people and things, it's rough but sometimes brutally funny dialogue, and it's riveting action sequences, there is nothing that has come before it that I can compare it to. It is a feast for the eye and you won't want to turn away for fear of missing a moment. Not for everyone as there are some very graphic scenes of violence but this is basically a comic book come to life. All the elements I've mention go into creating a wonderfully dark mood where the people of Sin City live and die, some heroically, some as cowards. I can honestly say there is nothing out there in the world of film like it. My best advice is, if you are uncertain about this movie, rent it and then make up your own mind if you want to add it to your home library.

Next I got excited about the whole thing and bought all the graphic novels that the movie was based on... and I read all those. While reading them, I applied each actor's face with the characters. So when I came time to see the actual movie, I not only understood what some of the visual ""oddities"" where (e.i. Marv's bandages on his face, Contrasting bricks in shadows), but I was actually greatly amused that those details were included in the film. Also, it wasn't hard at all getting used to the casting, since I already had in mind while reading the books.<br /><br />I must say, that those who haven't read the Graphic novels are missing a small (i repeat, small) edge to the film. It's much more amusing when you're watching the movie and are consistantly reminded of how f***ing accurate it is to the graphic novel. It's amazing... and i'm not even the biggest advocate of extreme-o super accurate adaptions. but this quality of the film cannot go unnoticed.<br /><br />As for those who hate ""this piece of crap"" film. well, they obviously have tastes should have never got them interested to watch the film in the first place.

The movie left a very strong impression on me, I must admit. If the crazy car chases and hyper-violent scenes are not enough for you, perhaps the incredibly faithful transcription from one medium to another that the story has gone through, in going from print to screen, will leave you as speechless as it left me.<br /><br />This reissue of the original theatrical version comes with a slightly alternate (unrated) version of the movie, which was recut and slightly extended in an attempt to make it even more like the original book. If you doubt that a movie can be faithful to a comic book (perhaps disappointed by earlier attempts in some Hollywood blockbusters), you will have a chance to follow the entire ""The Hard Goodbye"" story on the screen simultaneously with the included graphic novel... you will be amazed, I promise.<br /><br />As for extra material, there's plenty to wet the appetites of most fans of the genre, Rodriguez and Miller. From cuisine lessons (how to cook Breakfast Burritos) by Rodriguez; to an accelerated green screen version of the movie, where you can fully grasp the technical complexities in its shooting -not too far from how Episodes I, II and II were shot, mostly in the digital world-; there's something for everyone.

5301856,B004SIPA0A, A2GYX971VETQBV,5.0, Finally! - An Absolutely Brilliant Film Noir that Breaks with Tradition,"Stunning.  Simply stunning.  SIN CITY is, by far, one of the coolest action thrillers I have ever seen.  Watching it was like being thrown into the dark graphic novels that comprise Frank Miller's world: gritty, dark, bleak, and hostile.  It must have been a monumental task to film, judging from the featurettes included with the DVD.  The actors had to film almost entirely in front of a green screen, allowing the visual effects team to create the most intricate of backgrounds for each shot.  For my eyes, it is the ultimate noir piece.  Due to the computer backgrounds, there is perfect control over the lighting, black & white textures, etc.  Everything is controlled in this film (visually) right down to the smallest detail.  In turn, I think it is safe to say that Director Robert Rodriguez has done the best job of any director at bringing a comic book to the big screen.  This is not a corny adaptation with little men running around in costumes.  Rather than force the comic book world into the theater, the audience is dropped into that world.  The effect is stunning.<br /><br />Yet, despite the fact that the film is visually stunning, it does not rely solely on its effects to make the film.  The acting is quite good.  The entire group is perfectly cast: they seem ripped right out of the graphic novels.  In particular, Bruce Willis seems particularly suited to his role.  He belongs in this world.  But more so than any other actor, Mickey Rourke takes the cake.  He is a great character to open the movie with given that his performance and makeup job instantly set the tone for the entire film.  I hope to see more films working in this style and you'd better believe that Rourke should be at the top of the casting list next time.<br /><br />Even if you've never heard of Frank Miller or are not a fan of traditional action movies, SIN CITY will knock your socks off.  It is very unique and hopefully we haven't seen the last of its kind.  Of course, take my recommendation with a grain of salt: if you are opposed to graphic violence, you might be offended by the film.

From the theme song (Cells by The Servent) to the use of color (the intro will show you what I mean), this movie was excellent.  The writing/dialog is fantastic, and the acting is perfect.  Some complained about Jessica Alba seeming lost, but I thought she fit her role just fine.

In an interview over at IGN, Frank Miller talks about sequels (""You ask if there will be a second, I ask if there will be a fifth.""), and the special edition they were putting together at the time of the interview.  This special edition really will be one, with TONS of extras, and interviews, not just a ""making of"" and a cast bio.  I can't wait for it to come out, but since I can't find any release dates for it, get the movie now (or rent it) if you really need your Sin City fix.<br /><br />Can't wait for the special edition, and will meanwhile rent this a few more times.  Just love getting lost in the story!",Sin City
5301859,B004SIPA0A, A1DWQ9NTJMR9VY,5.0, Truly Amazing,"It helps to be familiar with Frank Miller's wonderful graphic novels (Sin City, batman returns,etc) to appreciate the incredible effect this movie has, but regardless this cinema delivers in full an amazing experience.  Consider it film noir on steriods, the atmosphere is so darkly textural that there is a complete suspension of disbelief and emersion into the hard and cold world of Sin City.  Acting and casting was superb.  It holds considerable violence, buyer beware.  You can't have a dark story about corruption, prostitution, murder, revenge, and redemption without some graphic scenes, but they are still treated with incredible skill.  My advice is to read the books first, then marvel at the interpretation to the screen, but regardless, it's the best movie I've seen in many years.  If you like that sort of thing, that is...",Sin City
5301860,B004SIPA0A, A36SOSKL6B13SX,3.0," It may be a ""Sin"" to see it...","With it's pioneering visuals, there is no doubt this movie is quite simply gorgeous to look at. It's plot isn't terrible, with three basic story lines that draw you in as much as the character's narrations of their situations. A bonus to this orginal film is the easy-on-the-ears dialogue; there's a relatively small amount of profanity for an R-rated film.<br /><br />But, it seems all good things have their downsides. As word truthfully has it, ""Sin City"" is a very graphically violent movie, reminescent of guest director Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" volumes. The film is riddled with nudity, pedophilia, strippers and creepy prositutes, and let us not forget cannibalism. Mixed messages also plague the screen (tinted with a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor), telling us (once again) that personal revenge is sweet, and it's okay to get it by whatever means, especially by grotesquely killing like no tomorrow.<br /><br />This film has only a couple of positives (not benefits, mind you), which can never be worth that sinking feeling you have after watching it, if you have any moral conscience at all.<br /><br />(pluggedinonline.org used as additional reference)",Sin City
5301861,B004SIPA0A, A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,3.0," Live-Action Graphic Novel, but Dull, Monotonous Movie.","""Sin City"" is a live-action graphic novel that adapts 3 of Frank Miller's books for the big screen: ""The Hard Goodbye"",""That Yellow Bastard"", and ""The Big Fat Kill"". Actors were shot against a green screen, and all of their environment is computer generated imagery. The result is a fairly accurate representation of Frank Miller's graphic style, judging by the little I have seen of it. The film is high-contrast black and white with splashes of color. The visual style might be described as a caricature of classic film noir's low-key lighting. The story takes place mostly at night, often on shiny, rain-soaked streets. There is a stunning lack of detail and depth of field, which I found too simplistic for the big screen, but it resembles drawings on the 2-dimensional pages of a book. In fact, the entire film is a caricature of classic film noir, although Frank Miller and co-director/editor Robert Rodriguez are lesser visual stylists and bigger romantics than the artists of classic film noir.<br /><br />We are presented with three stories whose single common element is a bar called ""Kadie's"". Police Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis) has tracked an 11-year old kidnap victim to a city warehouse, where she is in the clutches of a perverse murderer (Nick Stahl) with powerful political connections. Hartigan can outwit and outgun the murderer, but defeating the corruption behind him will prove more resilient. Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a psychotic, intensely violent ex-con. When his girlfriend Goldie (Jaime King) is murdered, his search for her killer leads him to the dungeon of cannibal-murderer Kevin (Elijah Wood) and up the chain of corruption. Shellie (Brittany Murphy), a barmaid at Kadie's, is trying to get rid of her abusive ex-boyfriend Jackie (Benicio Del Toro) in favor of the better-mannered Dwight (Clive Owen). Dwight follows Jackie into ""Old Town"", a red light district ruled by the prostitutes who live and work there, with the intention of ridding  the world of Jackie's menace. But the ladies, led by Gail (Rosario Dawson), have Jackie in their sights as well.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is the second feature film to place actors in an entirely computer-generated environment, and it suffers from many of the same limitations as 2004's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"": one-dimensional characters and visual tedium. Like ""Sky Captain"", ""Sin City"" is fascinating to look at for about 10 minutes. After that it's dull, dull, dull. I was intrigued by the idea of CGI films for a while, but, having seen 2 of them at this point, I have to say that they cannot create anything close to the visual interest of photography. ""Sin City"" is essentially an animated film, and it's not a very good one. The characters are one-dimensional and thoroughly unengaging. They all have the same personality, and they all do the same thing. The droning of incessant voice-over narration is so grating that I found myself tuning it out. The project might have fared better as 3 short films, which would break up the visual and narrative monotony.<br /><br />On the bright side, if you want to see Frank Miller's work brought to life ""Sin City"" does that -more literally than for its own good. Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba, as exotic dancer Nancy, generate some real charisma. But they are the only actors who do. These characters and storylines are not nearly sophisticated enough for a feature film, and neither is the CGI. ""Sin City"" is one of those rare films that had me looking at the clock every 10 minutes. I was profoundly bored. Watching the film has all the excitement of watching someone else play a computer game. You might have better luck if you consider it a live-action graphic novel instead of an actual film. Robert Rodriguez said, ""I didn't want to make Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City'. I wanted to make Frank Miller's 'Sin City'."" And so he did. The trouble is that Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" is not cinematic. Note that the film is ultra-violent and not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The DVD (Dimension 2005): The single bonus feature is a ""Behind the Scenes"" (8 1/2 minutes), which features interviews with Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, ""guest director"" Quentin Tarantino, and some members of the cast. They talk about the vision behind the film, but there is no discussion of technical details. Odd that we don't get more bonus features on a Robert Rodriguez film, but there it is.

The other reviews here can sing it's praises far better than I can, so I'll just get down to the point.<br /><br />Rodriguez has stated in interviews that the first release of the movie will be bare-bones and will contain little special features and no additional footage (It'll just be what you saw in theaters).  I'm the kind of person who would be upset to pay to buy this movie only to have a better version come out a few months later (which seems likely to happen).  So if you're like me, I would hold off on this for awhile until the Special Edition comes out with extended footage and the full special features load.

5301865,B004SIPA0A, A23L2BR07AOBG1,5.0, It succeeds in presenting and commenting on the genre of film noir,"One way that this film does this is by digitally affecting the film by providing it with unnatural color schemes that are identical to the ones in the graphic novels.  Now, the reality of the movie/genre/graphic novels, is a kind of hyper realism that doesn't feel realistic (this is fictional after all) although you know that some of the things that happen in the movie could happen and the film plays with these conventions well.  Noir is a genre that takes the audience into the mind of an everyday person and shows how they can be corrupted by sin, but still being a conflicted and basically good until their sin is found out and they're destoyed.  Well, in this movie there aren't many of these characters, most of them are sinners and gladly and accept the consequences indefinitely.  This is where the movie is the most interesting in the way that the color scheme both allows the action to go to extremes and get away with it because it presents an unreality and if you choose to view the perspective of the movie/graphic novel as the dream world of gritty noir characters than you have a good idea of what the film is like.  What's unexpected are how many portions of this film are so darkly humorous like when Benicio Del Toro's character is being drowned in the toilet by Clive Owen, it's completely unrealistic and we laugh at his plight because he deserves it and will do anything to get out of it, anything short of apologizing and backing off.  Yes, although this color scheme helps the film get past its aggressive, super-violent and gruesome content that doesn't mean you don't feel the effects of it.  They are still there, but you are always aware of the unreality and that somewhat deadens the effect and probably likens your reaction to the way the characters feel.  I felt the movie was as true to the graphic novels as possible even going as far as to call the movie plagiarism (That would be if Frank Miller weren't as involved as he is).  The movie is brilliant, if viscerally so, but although it is based on a graphic novel and anything slightly animated is bound to attract kids, this film is anything, but for kids.  I've mentioned the violent content without going into the more bloody details, but the sex is just as present and I'm not sure this dreamworld is one that you want your kids to know about yet, at least until they're older and have a better understanding of classic film noir, because as I said before this is a tribute and at the same time it's an update of the genre. Enjoy at your own risk.  By the way, I just have to give a shout out to Mickey Rourke who put in a great performance.  It's so big that it's almost too much for the rest of this film to stand up to.  I'm glad to see that he can still be used to great effect in films.",Sin City
5301866,B004SIPA0A, A12566TQYFUM6V,4.0, Interesting and different.,"I saw this movie not knowing much except it was almost exactly like the comic(camera angles, the character's looks, and the dialogue) and I never read the comics and had no idea they existed until this movie came out. I watched it and I actually enjoyed it for the most part, and I'm a girl. It was really fun to just watch (even if there was no audio)the black and white with certain things colored really worked and looked awesome on the big screen. I really enjoyed Marv's(Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan's(Bruce Willis) stories. They were the most interesting and fun to watch. Unfortunately Dwight's(Clive Owen) story was a real drag(thus why I give this 4 stars instead of 5 and why I say I liked this movie for the most part). I was so bored at that part and was glad it wasn't the last story. That would have been really bad to end the movie with that story. And the prostitutes were annoying too. But if I just ignore that part and focus on the rest of the movie I really really liked it even if it was violent and a ""guy flick""(naked girls). I recommend this movie to adults only and those who don't care about violence, nudity, and swearing. If you are a parent and you let your kid watch this you are one messed up parent! This is totally NOT a kid flick! And it does deserve it's ""R"" rating and 18 years and up warning!",Sin City

5301868,B004SIPA0A, A82LIVYSX6WZ9,5.0, Frank Miller's Sin City is a masterpiece......A knockout!!,"Opens up with a rooftop scene with a man and a woman...Josh Hartnett (Wicker Park) who plays a assassin and Marley Shelton (Valentine) who he kills. Then we get into more and more gritty, bloody, brutal and knockout hardcore stuff with 3 intermingling stories. Goes to Hartigan,played by a always rock solid Bruce Willis (Hostage), who rescues an 11 year old girl from the hands of a rapist, played by Nick Stahl (Bully) but Hartigan ends up on the recieveing end of a bunch of bullets landing him in the hospital. The first has Mickey Rourke(Once Upon A Time In Mexico) in a very very good comeback peformance as Marv who's love Goldie, played by Jaime King (Pearl Harbor) was killed by a silent assassin/cannibalistic psycho named Kevin, played with silent creepiness by Elijah Wood (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). Marv finds out that Goldie has a twin sister named Wendy, also played by Jaime King. So, Marv goes on a brutal killing spree in which he slices and dices everyone who gets in his path and ends up in a showdown with Kevin Boy. The electric chair scene was crazy!! Next up we follow shiny red converse wearing Dwight, played by a dynamic Clive Owen (Closer) who gets involved with a waitress named Shelly, played by Brittany Murphy (Little Black Book) and the corrupy cop named Jackie Boy, played by a insanely terrific Benicio Del Toro (The Way Of The Gun). Jackie Boy and his goons all get killed by some vicious hookers, led by Gail, a juicy Rosario Dawson (Alexander). They figure out that they killed a corrupt cop. My favorite scene in this whole movie would have to be when Dwight (Owen) is driving with a dead Jackie Boy (Del Toro)in the passenger seat and suddenly Jackie Boy starts to talk to him. The scene flips from different colors and that's the scene in which Quentin Tarantino special guest directed. Michael Clarke Duncan (Armageddon) and gang kidnap Gail (Dawson) for the head of Jackie Boy and it ends up in a major bloodbath. The last one is the rest of Hartigan's (Willis') story where he goes to jail for something he didnt do and when he is let go he goes in search of a fully grown up Nancy Callahan, played by the delicious Jessica Alba (Honey) and he has to save her from the treacherous clutches of The Yellow Bastard who was the rapist (Nick Stahl) in which he saved little Nancy from before and Willis ""litterally"" punches The Yellow Bastard's brains in and rips off his other head as well. Josh Hartnett is also at the end, like in the beginning, playing the same man/assassin as he appears in an elevator with hooker Becky, played by Alexis Bleidel (Gilmore Girls). Also starring Michael Madsen (Kill Bill 1 and 2), Devon Aoki (D.E.B.S.), Nicky Katt (Suburbia), Powers Boothe (Frailty), Rutger Hauer (Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Carla Gugino (Spy Kids Trilogy) and Frank Miller himself is in this...he's the preist whom Marv (Rourke) kills.

5301869,B004SIPA0A, A38UBVJEV1LLS7,5.0, Powerful and Vibrant,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie, but with such a big cast I really could not refuse the temptation to see why so many big names would sign on. The movie opened simply, but I know from minute one that it was going to be a blast. The violence was so intense, but somehow not overpowering, at least not most of it. There were a few scenes that made me cringe; however, these were necessary to the power of the film. Having never read the books (although I hear that the movie is a mirror copy) I was a little shocked. I have seen worse, but this was coming from a ""Comic book..."" oh well. I loved the cast. Willis, Rourke, Alba, Dawson, Owen, and even Hartnett, Murphy, and Wood played it cool. I was also glad to see the emergence of some new faces, who actually got good air time! These included _2 Fast 2 Furious's_  Devon Aoki as the unconquerable Miho and the beautiful and extremely talented _Gilmore Girl_  Alexis Bledel as Becky, the backstabbing prostitute.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is unbeatable, the use of color is wild and brilliant; it accentuates the drama and gore to an extreme - bringing the characters to life. And yes, it is true, the majority of the women are hookers in this film, but they are far from helpless. I would recommend this movie to anyone old enough (and with an open enough mind) to comprehend the beauty in the madness. It takes formidable jabs at the hypocrisy that plagues the Church and the police, while glorifying the everyday, flawed, hero. It applauds loyalty and loathes treachery - important in a workable society. The more I think about this film, the more I think it may be - dare I say - Inspirational.",Sin City

5301871,B004SIPA0A, A3M7RECGYLXOPA,5.0," Dark, cryptic, disturbing, and absolutely brilliant.","I very rarely write movie reviews, mainly because I'm not that good at it, but I have to make an exception for this one.  ""Sin City"" is by far one of the most creative and stunningly well-made movies I've seen in quite some time.  I got the same  feeling from watching it as I did ""Kill Bill"", in that I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterward, simply because it's so freaking good.<br /><br />First of all, there's the cinematography, which is just unbelievable.  The whole movie was filmed in a studio here in Austin, and nearly everything but the characters is digitally inserted.  They used basically no set for the whole thing, but everything looks so real (in a surreal kind of way).  And, the use of color is just brilliant.  The movie is mostly black and white, but other colors are sporadically thrown in for emphasis, and to brilliant effect.  The flashes of red blood, the cold, murderous stare of Elijah Wood, Alexis Bledel's gorgeous blue eyes, the vivid, um yellowness of the Yellow Bastard, all are brought out wonderfully amidst a black and white world.<br /><br />Now, just the special effects alone are enough to make this an entertaining movie, but it doesn't stop there.  The performances are all great as well.  I've never cared much for Mickey Rourke, but he does a spectactular job as the relentlessly vindictive Marv.  Bruce Willis has long shed his action hero image, for which he was once well-known, but here, he returns to that style with a vengeance (no ""Die Hard"" pun intended) as the hard-boiled Detective Hardigan.  Elijah Wood is just amazing as the silent but deadly Kevin, and of course we have Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, and many other lovely women with sedutive and memorable roles (I wish I'd known when they were filming this; so many girls I could have hit on ;).<br /><br />I don't want to reveal too much about the story, but basically it consists of several smaller stories, that all weave together into one larger plot.  The constant shifting of main characters, and the voice-over narrations of each one help to keep things interesting, and to demand your attention.  Much like ""Kill Bill"", it sort of skips around chronologically, but I think the story is initially much easier to follow overall.  And, like ""Kill Bill"", there's a lot of graphic, over-the-top violence, but the black and white sort of helps to dull it over a bit, so it doesn't really seem quite as gory as it is.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fantastic movie that any fan of excellent cinema should see.  Robert Rodriguez has said that he wants to make movies of the entire ""Sin City"" series (and Johnny Depp is even slated to be in one), so I greatly look forward to the next installment.",Sin City

It has the most originality since Citizen Kane. The color scheme, the direction, the stylized violence, the truly well thought out characters all combines to make this one helluva film. And dare I say it, but maybe the return of sensless nudity? Sin City had a definate Noir influence, and the dialogue is right out of the time when Noir was king. Also the monologue of the characters was very helpful, and lent the movie even more of that comic book feel. The characters were able to tell us, in their own words what was going through their minds.<br />To tell you the truth I was starting to wonder about Rodriguez, after Desperado and Once Upon A Time. But that is all behind us now Robert, if you ask me he has made the best film in the 20 years. Like Kurosawa you have once again risen above the ashes, to bring about a cinematic masterpiece.<br />3 stories from Frank Miller's Sin City were chosen to make their theatrical debut. Though I never read them I did pick up Yellow Bastard and read it at the local book store to see what all the fuss was about. Mickey Rourke as Marv, Bruce Willis as Garrety and Clive Owen as Dwight all do one stellar job in bringing their penciled characters to cinematic life. Though if you ask me Mickey stole the show, he was, as far as I'm concerned Marv.<br />There was a blatant de-masculinization aspect to the film, I mean I can't count the number of times that someone got shot, stabbed, mutilated or hit in the man's bathing suit area. Furthermore this trend or theme was cemented by having prostitutes who run their own part of town (Old Town) without the help of male pimps.

5301875,B004SIPA0A, A33IZJVCKFKDPU,5.0, It Would Be a 'Sin' To Miss This One,"As you have probably heard, Sin City is based off of Frank Miller's ""Graphic"" novels, and yes, graphic is a very good word to describe this movie.  The movie takes place in a fictional city, maybe nieghboring Gotham City or Metropolis.  However this city does not have any real heros, per se, there are a few good-doers, but they are also crooks (with the exception of Bruce Willis' character, John Hartigan).  This city has been overrun by corruption and director Robert Rodriguez does a great job of creating a digital atmosphere of the City.<br /><br />For the most part, this movie plays out like a Quentin Tarentino film.  The movie consists of three stories, which are not in chronological order, that eventually intertwine with eachother.  The first of those stories is about aging cop John Hartigan trying to save young Nancy Callahan from a serial rapist.  Hartigan gets betrayed by his partner (Michael Madsen) and is set-up for the kidnapping and an alleged rape.  This story concludes at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The second story revolves around Marv (Mickey Rourke).  Marv is a big, ugly guy that has a beautiful girl come into his life one day and he can't figure out why.  Well, she is murdered and Marv is set-up for the crime.  This eventually spirals into Marv going on a hunt for the person who killed his ""angel"".  The hunt leads him to the home of a Senator and the most powerful priest in town.  With the help of some of the town's female escorts, Marv eventually gets face to face with the killer of his ""angel"" for a showdown.<br /><br />The female escorts also help out Dwight (Clive Owen) in the thrid story.  Dwight becomes involved with a waitress (Brittany Murphy) and has to deal with her one-time companion Jack (Benicio Del Toro), who is the type of guy that always has a posse follow him around for protection purposes.  Now a chase that leads into the Escort's side of town endangers a truce that was made with the Mob and the police.  Its Dwight's job to try to prevent this truce from ending and to prevent a sort of ""mob war"".<br /><br />All of the actors do a pretty good job with the roles they are given and seem to be comfortable playing those characters.  Marv is the character with the most depth of any of the many characters.  As mentioned earlier, Rodriguez has done a great job with this movie.  The city and the atmosphere of the movie are great.  Also the colorization of the film is also something that has never been done before.  Some characters or particular item have color, while the majority of the film is in a black comic book looking color.  The visuals of this film are the most impressive aspect.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to see this film.  It is one of the most original films that I have seen in a while.  Also, the film may have changed the comic book genre forever.  If you have a weak heart, this may be too violent.  Otherwise, if you enjoy action movies with a good storyline and great visuals, then you should definately check out this movie.",Sin City

I've heard comparisons  ranging from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars but really the film stands all on its own.  An amazing and altogether unique moviegoing experience that reawakens us to the incredible possibilities of film.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that we have Robert Rodriguez (and of course, Frank Miller) to thank for this.  The guy knows how to make movies like no other.  I was impressed with Guillermo Del Toro's fanboy fueled Hellboy last year and with Sin City we get an equally impressive and awe inspiring realization of an underground comic brought vividly, and brutally, to life.<br /><br />Sin City is comprised of three books, The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard.  I could almost swear that for some minor deviances due to film constraints and the insecurities of Jessica Alba (really, it wouldn't have killed you to be topless as Nancy the stripper for cryin' outloud!) the movie is a frame for frame reenactment of the comics.  It helps to have read the books first, just to fully understand what is being done.<br /><br />In 1990 Warren Beatty did a superb job of bringing Dick Tracy to the screen and now, in 2005 we have Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wholly deserving of praise for their new noir masterpiece.  It's visceral, it's raw, and it's entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />The casting is top notch, Bruce Willis as Hartigan; the truly underappreciated Mickey Rourke as Marv; Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Nick Stahl, Brittany Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe-they all do fine jobs.  But it's Benicio Del Toro who has the standout part as Jackie Boy.  He's funny, vicious, and unsettling all at the same time.<br /><br />If you're looking for hard boiled, white knuckle action with insane violence (we're talking gleeful overkill here) look no further than Sin City.  The first must see movie of 2005 and a beacon of hope for the future of film.  I'm hoping this makes a killing at the ol' box office because there are more Sin City books ready and waiting for the big screen.",Sin City
5301877,B004SIPA0A, A2NJO6YE954DBH,5.0, Miller's graphic novels become Rodriguez's film noir epic,"""Sin City"" is a black and white world, except when the blood is being sprayed around and then be prepared for lots of red or white or even yellow. Based on three of the first four ""Sin City"" graphic novels by Frank Miller (""The Hard Good-Bye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard"") and ""The Customer Is Always Right"" short-story from ""Babe Wore Red"" that was the test run for this project, this 2005 film sets the standard for what film noir will be in the 21st century and advances the cause of digital filmmaker even more than ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow."" That film was pure eye candy, but ""Sin City"" is much too gritty to be that sweet. You are going to wince at some of what happens in this film and you might even turn away once or twice as the over the top violence hits you in the gut as hard as it hits some of the characters in the side of the head. But chances are you are going to love this movie to death.<br /><br />Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" is a world where the heroes can take a whole series of punches as well as deliver them, where justice has nothing to do with either mercy or the cops, and the system is crooked from top down to pretty near the bottom of the barrel. The dames are still worth dying for and some of them might even be goddesses, but others can defend themselves quite well, thank you. This is a world where protecting women is hard-wired into the psyches of guys like John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke), and Dwight (Clive Owen). If you fail to protect a dame, then somebody has to pay and in a way that will make the scum bucket think Hell is heaven when you finally let them go there. This movie is rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue, but that is an R that is a lot closer to NC-17 than it is to PG-13.<br /><br />Ang Lee tried to have parts of ""The Hulk"" look like a comic book, but that meant throwing several frames on the screen at the same time. But with ""Sin City"" director Robert Rodriguez knows that a comic book panel can be like a frame in a motion picture and visa-versa, so his solution was to embrace Miller's visual style and make him the co-director of the film (and give him a small role as a priest hearing his final confession). The ""Sin City"" were done largely in black and white, although sometimes white and black, and other times when the strategic addition of a single color as in the red of a woman's lips, the yellow of her hair, or the blue of her eyes. Sometimes the red is a cool looking car.<br /><br />This is the bloodiest film noir of my experience, so it is a good thing that when there is a lot of blood is it just as likely to appear as bright white or neon yellow as globs of the red stuff. But it is also evokes more bursts of laughter at the audacious violence and the perfectly timed one-liners, most of which will never work uttered in Dirty Harry fashion out of the context of the film. This is film noir in the tradition of Mickey Spillane updated for the Quentin Tarantino generation.<br /><br />The standout performance in ""Sin City"" is clearly Mickey Rourke as Marv, who is buried under so much makeup you keep assuring yourself that he is really in there somewhere. In keeping with the formula of the film Marv is both the most violent of the protagonists, giving taking somebody for a ride a whole new meaning, and the funniest, in both word and deed. Willis and Owen are both fine as the other two protagonists, but they are more the strong and silent types, neither as reflective nor as sardonic as Marv. Willis definitely has the world weary act honed down to perfection, but Owen seems a bit too mannered in his detachment in his story line and ends up finishing third in the hero sweepstakes. Elijah Wood as Kevin does not get to speak but still creeps you out as Frodo gone over to the Dark Side. Benicio Del Toro shows some nice comic timing as Jack Rafferty and Michael Madsen has not changed a bit as Bob, while Nick Stahl is scum of two different colors. Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth and Michael Clarke Duncan all take turns playing heavies and it becomes pretty clear Rodriguez could get just about anybody he wanted to do this movie.<br /><br />Of the women of ""Sin City"" it is Devon Aoki as Miho who stands out although she never says a word (she does not have to). Jessica Alba's best moments as Nancy are silent, although there is a change in why that is the case as we go through the movie. Rosario Dawson has fun going over the top as Gail, Brittany Murphy goes slumming as Shellie, and Jaime King plays two sides of the same coin as Goldie and Wendy. Alexis Bledel is certainly trying to get as far away from Rory Gilmore as possible by playing Becky, but I am afraid she does not get far in that regard. Then again, if you have read Miller's graphic novels you will be impressed by how Rodriguez has brought the stark black and white images of Becky, Hartigan, the Yellow Bastard and the rest of them to life on the screen. This movie is going to make a ton of money, Miller is going to sell a lot of copies of the new editions of his ""Sin City"" graphic novels, and hopefully it will not be too long before we get the next cinematic installment, which should have Johnny Depp playing Wallace in the ""To Hell and Back"" segment.",Sin City
5301878,B004SIPA0A, AWPALDK2S4MFV,2.0, Best movie of 2005....One of the year's worst DVDs.,"Sin city was an amazing movie and I could not wait to own it. It turns out Dimension plans on releasing this bare craptacular of a dvd and release a ""Special Edition"" later on. I cannot wait till later to own this amazing movie, so i pre-ordered this sad excuse of a DVD. I will not buy the SE because I'm not made of money. In a perfect world, the Special Edition would be the one released in two weeks.",Sin City
5301879,B004SIPA0A, A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,4.0," Good DVD for top-notch pulp movie, but better DVD out there","If this were a straight ""movie review,"" I'd give Robert Rodriguez's (and Frank Miller's) ""Sin City"" five stars.  But this is a DVD review, so the product itself gets a mere four stars.  Buyers beware -- there is a ""Recut, etc."" edition of this DVD that has a heck of a lot more in the way of cookies, extras, and all those other little treats that make DVDs so much fun.  This is a ""smaller"" DVD with fewer extras.  Make sure you're buying the correct edition.<br /><br />On to the movie.  ""Sin City"" throws the audience into Frank Miller's ultra-hard-boiled comic metropolis, Basin City (aka ""Sin City"").  One wonders how this city functions, as its only inhabitants appear to be cops (generally corrupt, with one lone exception), prostitutes (generally, with one lone exception, with hearts of gold), criminal scum, and corrupt politicians.  I pity the schoolteacher who works at Basin City Senior High School.<br /><br />A revolutionary use of digital filmmaking technology allows ""Sin City"" to be told in the same stark black-and-white color scheme that makes Frank Miller's graphic novels so much fun.  There are occasional blasts of color, but generally black-and-white rules the day.<br /><br />Fans of Miller's graphic novels will see no surprises in ""Sin City,"" other than the technical skill with which the filmmakers translate the comix to the big screen.  This is almost a shot-for-shot remake of three graphic novels:  ""The Hard Goodbye,"" ""The Big Fat Kill,"" and ""That Yellow Bastard.""  There is also a very brief short story that sort of bookends the film, based on Miller's short tale ""The Babe Wore Red.""  These are essentially the same stories exactly as Miller wrote them in his graphic novels, only slightly truncated for time.<br /><br />But the tone is all there.  Miller's Holy Trinity appears to be ""Bullets, Booze and Broads,"" the title of his collection of short story comix set in Basin City.  And boy, does this movie bring the goods.<br /><br />I'll leave the summarizing of the plot for other reviewers.  I'll just give you my reaction.  ""Sin City"" is one of those movies that qualifies as a ""Great Guilty Pleasure.""  There's nothing ""redeeming"" or ""important"" or ""telling a story that needs to be told"" in ""Sin City.""  It's Dashiell Hammet's ""The Maltese Falcon"" for the 21st century.  The acting is all just this side of over-the-top, which qualifies as perfectly restrained given Miller's hyperbolic stories.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Powers Boothe, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen . . . these are fine actors, but ""they don't do nuance.""  And that's perfectly appropriate.  There are several fine performances by the actresses, too, as Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba emerge as the most memorable amongst the bevy of beauties who live in Sin City's Amazonia, Old Town.<br /><br />All in all, ""Sin City"" is a thrill ride, the kind of movie where a man can describe his girlfriend as a ""Valkyrie,"" and it comes across as perfectly appropriate, given the hard-boiled circumstances.  Check it out, but just make sure you're buying the right DVD edition.",Sin City

5301882,B004SIPA0A, AHLLAC2MGV8RP,5.0, Fot the pundit generation,"I wanted to dislike this film, I really did.  But it just reminded me of some critics who do not seem to understand that movies don't have to be the same old scene, and that maybe some movies can be adapted from a rather incredible source and honor that source by mimicking the style of the source so successfully that anyone who is familiar with said source material will be transfixed, amazed, and comforted that movies are not doomed (just Hollywood).  If this was to be adapted from a standard novel would the source material be used so literally?  Of course not - standard novels are not a series of pictures that are easily interpreted as storyboards.  This film was all style and substance, and to think otherwise indicates too much distraction in the critic's heart when considering how different this movie is from others.  It's not a Merchant Ivory film, it's not a Lion's Gate film, it's a pulp noir that looks about as perfect as the 2-D technology allows.  A Sin City story could not be appropriately told without the heavy contrast of black and white.  Great story, fascinating and memorable characters, and well-shot action.  It gets one star for Rutger Hauer's too-short performance, and four more for (fot) everything else.",Sin City
5301883,B004SIPA0A, A1TR9417Z4U72F,4.0," Be careful for what you wish for, you might just get it...","Sin City isn't a perfect film; in fact it isn't even close.  It's hard to say inclusively that it's bad or good, because there are a lot of different aspects to the flick.<br /><br />As far as translation from book to screen, the movie is near flawless.  Rodriguez and Miller have managed to recreate Miller's heavily stylized comics on the big screen without losing an iota of the heavy black or stark white.  They also manage to keep the dialogue and internal monologue intact which are both a merit and a major problem with the film.  Most people who've read Miller's Sin City work don't make the connection to Mickey Spillane and Sam Spade, to Humphrey Bogart and the lingo of the Hard Boiled detective pulp novels.  So when they hear the dialogue in the movie delivered in such a manner it'll probably come off as comic or exaggerated.  People today just don't remember or care for the older genres that so many of today's writers and directors fell in love with as children.  People expect an update not a faithful homage.  Yet they complain when they feel a book to film translation isn't faithful.  Simply put, people don't know what they want.<br /><br />That being said, I think the film also suffers a little in it's editing.  Being so faithful to its graphic novel roots, I feel that Rodriguez failed to treat the three novels as individual stories.  The three chapters blur into one another in a slightly uncomfortable manner with only a change in narrator to tip the viewer that we are switching gears.  I think the film would benefit from titled chapters, ala Kill Bill, which would be in keeping with the source material.<br /><br />The film is also heavily CG'd, but I think that helps to define baSin city as it's own world just outside of our reality.  It also makes it easier to swallow the use of bright highlights of color and the exaggerated cartoon violence.<br /><br />I also feel the film was superbly cast with Mickey Rourke as a standout and Elijah Wood as a surprisingly creepy Kevin.<br /><br />All in all I think a lot of people are going to have a problem with aspects of the film that are actually quite faithful to Miller's graphic novels.  The ""corny"" dialogue, over the top unrealistic violence and action, the slightly cartoonish or simple characterization, all of these are in the Sin City books, and I think a lot of fans forgive this in the comics but won't in the film.  To me this points to unrealistic expectations of the adaptation to the silver screen, or more commonly, be careful for what you wish for, you might just get it.",Sin City

She seems slightly out of place.<br /><br />Bruce Willis owns this movie, Hartigan is one character who you will feel for, especially with the emotionally gut wrenching scene at the end.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much of the story away, but whether you're a comic freak or a moviephile, go out and see this one opening day.

That alone is an amazing achievement and I wish I ended up liking the movie more than I did.<br /><br />There are 3 different stories told here, all taking place in the title location of Sin City. Mickey Roarke plays a low life trying to avenge the murder of a prostitute who showed him kindness. The second story has Clive Owen, a murderer, seeking revenge on Benicio Del Toro, a low-life cop, on behalf of his new girlfriend. The last tale is an odd love story between old washed-up cop Bruce Willis and the girl he saves from a psycho when she is 11.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful on paper, but not all of them give good performances. Some of the dialog and voice-over narration is very well done and some is laughably bad. The film overall is too long and drags after awhile. There is a lot of violence and blood which I have no problem with, except that it was overdone.

To take its elements -- such as voice-over; choppy corny dialog; unevenly rendered details; and gritty, realistic, but seemingly arbitrarily arranged compositions -- and apply them to motion pictures, should be a disaster. But SIN CITY really does work. The images are dramatic, the acting intense, the plots thoughtful. The presumed-crude elements lend a throwback sense to the movie, almost as if one is back in the early silent era and the director is experimenting with the medium and struggling and stumbling to get his story told. Yet it's probably mostly state-of-the-art special effects!<br /><br />And the DVD looks great on a bigscreen TV! Everything's vivd.

The color'd items popped into view: green eyes, red lips and occasionally white blood -- decapitations and body limbs flying not withstanding.<br /><br />Jessica Alba is hot in this picture, just seeing her in the cowboy outfit rates a couple of stars right there.

""Sin City"" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes ""Sin City,"" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike ""Sky Captain,"" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three ""Sin City"" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is not quite a ""Kill Bill"" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. ""Sin City"" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy.

I could go on and on about all the different aspects of the film (including the beautiful women!) but [..]sez it better:<br /><br />Review by Jeremy Wheeler<br />As far as comic adaptations go, Sin City is an unprecedented book-to-screen translation that's locked, loaded, and rip-roaring ready to introduce movie audiences to the mad genius that is Frank Miller. By meticulously re-creating the acclaimed comic creator's most personal work, co-director Robert Rodriguez has given Miller's creation the chance to live and breathe using the exact hard-nosed dialogue and iconic camera shots from the acclaimed graphic novels. The end result is a mad brushstroke of digital filmmaking that is risqu&eacute; enough to be considered bold, while palatable enough for exploitive entertainment purposes. It remains to be seen what the unprepared masses will think of Sin City -- in fact, there couldn't be a better, more PC time for the flick to hit. Basically a slap in the face to neo-conservative ideals, the film is so full of gleeful graphic violence and raw, steaming sexuality that there's sure to be some kind of backlash somewhere. The cast is a knockout, with major kudos going to Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, and even a smaller, supporting appearance by Rutger Hauer as they fulfill their inspired casting choices and take delicious delight in this world of corruption and sleaze. The stark black-and-white visuals are the real star here though, merging film noir sensibilities and dynamic comic panel storytelling with the help of a heap-load of computer graphics and inventive filmmaking to create something that's new, raw, and refreshing. Additionally, the direct translation is both exciting and a bit jarring, lending an unusual pace that you don't see in modern cinema; just as the gusto violence will turn off many and probably create more cynics in the critical circles, so too will the film continue to polarize its viewers due to its experimental nature. Comparisons will no doubt be drawn between the page and screen for years to come, which might hurt the film simply because it is an adaptation and no matter how direct a translation it is, there's bound to be things that are lost in the process. Still, after years of being jerked around in Hollywood, Miller is finally given the tools to strut his stuff on the big screen and, love it or leave it, perfect or not, that's exactly what Sin City is.",Sin City

5301909,B004SIPA0A, AG5XM49AZVIYH,3.0," Hard to know what's going on, but still kept my interest","It's definitely hard to tell what exactly is going on. I don't mean it's hard to tell that Mickey Rourke is unleashing hell on those riot cops (and just about everyone) to avenge his lover. What I mean is that because I haven't seen the comics I don't know the general details, like why are only some people and things in color, why does the origninal story keep switching to completely different stories, and what exactly is the Sin City, though it isn't hard to figure out its either based far in the future, or is a parallel world altogether.<br /><br />There are 3 main themes in this movie. Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is the first main character, a cop going after the governor's son, who is a rapist. Suddenly, however, as Hartigan lays bleeding on a dock (shot about 15 times and still living, another detail that was above me because of not reading the novels), the story switches over to Mickey Rourke's character. Having nothing to do with Hartigan, it doesn't take long for Mickey Rourke to go on a killing spree. He kills everyone from riot cops to cannibal priests, using various weapons such as a bow saw, hatchet, and well, his bare hands.<br /><br />This time the story is resolved, Rourke is taken to the electric chair, and dies. Now the story switches again, this time to Clive Owen's character. He plays Dwight, a player who also loves killing. He runs around town killing people who upset his lovers. At one point he has a dead cop in the front seat of his car. The cop is dead but continues to talk, leaving me wondering if Clive Owen is insane, or if this is another detail you can only understand after reading the novels. Clive goes on to kill everyone he needs to to resolve his and his lovers' problems, making for good action but not much of a plot.<br /><br />Finally, the story returns to Hartigan, who is in the hospital. He goes to jail (details I won't go into) for a crime commited by the governor's son. He gets out after 8 years, and goes to find Jessica Alba, who he saved back on the docks 8 years ago. Well, he finds her, and I'm glad, cause she sure is hot. What's weird though, is that Rourke and the dead cop are admiring Jessica Alba's dancing (so was I) while drinking their full mugs of beer. They were killed earlier in the movie, but now they're sitting in a bar like any old drunk watching the dancers. Yet another unexplainable detail I can only imagine is explained in the novels. I can't really remember the plot after this, because I was paying much more attention to Jessica Alba, but anyway... Hartigan ends up killing an orange goblin-like guy. He uses what some may call unnesecary violence to kill this guy (he rips the goblin's balls off, then beats the thing's head into pulp, all with his bare hands). But really, when you look back after watching this movie, the whole thing is filled with pointless violence. It makes for great action that any moron can enjoy, even if they don't understand it.<br /><br />When I watched this, I wasn't really sure what to expect. It definitely has its weird moments, and plenty of violent ones too. It also has its fair number of hot chicks and badass killers. With all the action, I can hardly give this movie anything below three stars, even if the plot is nonexistent at points. To rap things up, any idiot can watch this movie and enjoy it, because most of the movie is just a violent shoot-fest (who doesn't enjoy a shoot-fest?) with a good deal of whores and other chicks running around half-naked. If you can't stand a lot of violence, rent something like Elmo's Christmas, but if all you look for in a movie is sex and non-stop action, this belongs in your DVD player.",Sin City

What you'll find if you're not a comic/graphic novel geek is a compelling visual experience.  It has the standard Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino level of violence, so be careful.  This is an edgy, engaging journey through a different world.  What Rodriguez/Miller do with color and movement in the movie is really interesting.  The directors end up relying on the Tarantinoesque Pulp Fiction mode of semi-related stories to get through the movie, but the experience seems to me to be more aesthetic than narrative.<br /><br />Do the benefits of the ""Special Edition"" really add up to the cost?  I don't know.  I could barely tell the extra scenes that were in this addition, but I find that the many bonus features and the multitude of commentary tracks made this edition more worthwhile than the ""plain jane"" version.",Sin City

It was that mesmerizing.<br /><br />This movie could easily have grossed over $200M if it wasn't so bold in attacking the religious right and those in power.<br /><br />Sin City is where people regularly suffer oppression and injustice from those in power (priests, senators, and police). It is a story of those who choose to fight against their brutal oppressors.<br /><br />The protagaonists, although far from perfect and ideal, genuinely want to do good and right in a world where virtue is rare. Fighting back often means making the powerful suffer. It becomes a game of who can inflict the most pain on the other. Is such a world so far from the reality?<br /><br />The movie is bold in its search for the truth of the human heart. Will a man do anything for a woman who has given him her body and kindness when no one else has? Can a good cop overcome his irresistible attraction to a voluptuous 19 year old whom he has saved from rape only 8 years earlier?<br /><br />The protagonists and villians are highly unique.

But the gore, gore and more gore is often minimalized by an effect that shows the splatter in off white and usually only the carnage gets red treatment. In fact, the entire movie was in some cool variation of black and white with red as the predominant color that does not get black and white treatment. Oh, there's an occasional pair of blue-eyes here and there and other brief color treatments, but the film is mostly in the funky black and white.<br /><br />Sin City jumps around a bit similar to Pulp Fiction. The jumping is actually effective and easy to follow. The movie is the story of the pursuit of a couple of serial killers...one pursued by Bruce Willis, the other pursued by Mickey Rourke...and the story of a network of hookers...and how the pursuit of the serial killers and the network of hookers all ultimately interconnect.<br /><br />Captivating, very entertaining, and suspenseful at times.

5301914,B004SIPA0A, ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,4.0, (3.5 STARS) Frank Miller's Noir Worl,"It's graphic book version of 'Kill Bill,' it's pitch dark, it's violent, it's nasty, it's whatever makes you sick, and it's very fascinating.  Not everyone would find the film that way, and I confess I am not a big fan of this film or Frank Miller's original books, but I still kept watching this brutal world where the revenge story of The Bride is enacted on everyday basis.<br /><br />Perhaps it is pointless to repeat the story after more than 500 reviewers pasted their own views.  As they said, 'Sin City' means the title itself, the city filled with crimes and violence, where the dark world of the original comic book comes alive.  Three stories, each of which are connected tangentially (ala 'Pulp Fiction'), features three tough guys: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen.  And all of their stories involve women, as old noir films do.<br /><br />[BRITTANY MURPHY SAID ... ] I would like to add something else.  Brittany Murphy, who came to Japan to promote the film (with Devon Aoki), during the interview with Yahoo Japan strongly recommended that those viewers who find the content too sick should wait for Mickey Rourke.  She said, 'it's 'meant to be funny.'<br /><br />Funny?  She said so clearly.  I'd rather say 'darkly funny' but she made a good point about Rourke.  Marv, played by Mickey Rourke, vows a revenge for a beautiful girl who slept with him just one night, and follows those responsible no matter what it takes.  As you see, the story itself is nothing new, just a standard noir one.  But it is the way of revenge or killing that matters.  Bullets are too ordinary.  You should be Hannibal Lector to claim originality in Sin City.<br /><br />[MICKEY'S SEMI-COMEBACK]  Among the various players gathering for this rare chance to become the comic book characters themselves, Mickey Rourke steals every scene in this film.  In fact, almost all actors are excellent ... I said 'almost' because Bruce Willis looks exactly Bruce Willis (perhaps that is not a bad thing), and Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, and Nick Stahl, all cast against type, are less convincing and impressive than Rourke, Owen, or Benicio Del Toro.<br /><br />As to the story and script 'Sin City' needs more re-writes.  Frequent voice-overs are annoying to me, and some materials are used too much (like torture and imprisonement). 'Sin City' is not as groundbreaking as 'Pulp Fiction' but is visually rivetting, no question about it.",Sin City

It's a disjointed story with various different plot threads that have a few connections with characters from previous ones appearing in certain scenes which are obviously not in chronological order since some people have already died in a previous scene.  The film has a very unique visual style of the likes I've never really seen before.  It's like a comic come to life and it was very well done.  Also, if you don't like seeing people's faces smashed into a bloody pulp you may want to skip this because it was pretty violent.  However, some of it is done in some creative ways such as the blood being a different color or a person being ripped to pieces in silhouette form.  Great film.

Mickey Rourke plays Marv a hard-hitting, gritty fighter ready to kill his way to the answer. No bull logic for Marv, he's all about fists and beat downs. He meets a beautiful woman (prostitute) who treats him like a decent human despite his horrid looks. While he's having a good time with her, he wakes up the next day and finds that she's been murdered right next to him. Marv goes berserk against the cops, hoodlums, everyone! He keeps remembering that she was the one person who treated him decent and now it was time to pay back the lowlife that took her life.<br /><br />Marv goes to the edge of the gutter and beyond to find the answers. He makes some funny revelations along the way that will have you laughing your socks off.  Be warned though, it gets disturbingly, graphic in the scenes with Elijah Wood as Kevin a catlike killer. As if Elijah Wood wasn't weird enough, we see him really do a number on Marv but the revenge Marv takes on him may be a little too much for most people to bear. I'm telling you all, there's a scene with Marv and Kevin that's the most horridly disgusting scene in the entire movie. The other stories are really intriguing as well as managing to bring all the stories to a nice logical ending. Karma is at work throughout this movie so don't worry, everyone will get what they deserve except maybe poor Marv.<br /><br />Sin City is definitely following the comic book making sure to try and hold up the comic book look. It is one of the few unique looking movies that have several well-known stars in it. I figured with all the big names in the movie it would be a flop because usually star powered movies are bad.

I love it when films become instant cult classics purely based upon the originality of the media - bad or good. To see his world transferred to a feature film was quote ""A dream come true"" It seems that a wide range of viewers actually dislike the films dialogue and plot transfer. I believe that this is due to the direct script from the original comic book. At times it can read rather dull, but if you have seen any of the Sin City graphic novels, you can quickly understand that it is all part of a stylish flow which can be easily accepted once understood.<br /><br />A long time coming, this film could have probably turned out to be an easy disaster for both Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, going the way of other comic to film transfers. Luckily with full control over the production (a rarity in this industry) both were able to sculpt the feature into a beautiful mold of dark comedy, ultra violence, sex, and all that good stuff. Both directors show us that it is not about the content specifics, it is how you go about using them. My rating for this film would have been perfect except for the script transfer, however that is how the cookie crumbles when jumping directly from Comic to Film.

The three stories, although separate, are meticulously intertwined, and brilliantly brought to the screen with one of the biggest casts ever assembled for a comic to film adaptation.  Disfigured tough guy Marv (Mickey Rourke, perfectly cast), uncovering a plot orchestrated by a sinister cardinal (Rutger Hauer) while tracking down the cannibalistic killer (Elijah Wood, unbelievably creepy) and seeking revenge for the death of his true love (Jamie King).  Then, there is Dwight (Clive Owen), a good guy at the wrong place at the wrong time.  His efforts to stop the violent ex-boyfriend (Benicio Del Toro) of a barmaid (Brittany Murphy) goes horribly wrong, and leads to a showdown with the girls of Old Town, and a stunner of a revelation that promises blood flowing in the streets.  The final story revolves around old cop John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) and his attempt to take down a psychopath (Nick Stahl) who kidnapped a little girl, but he himself ends up in jail.  Eight years later, Hartigan gets his chance to save her again (Jessica Alba, hot as ever) in a climactic showdown with a yellow skinned psychopath.  The casting is excellent for the most part, including Rourke, Owen, and Del Toro perfectly cast as Marv, Dwight, and Jackie Boy respectively.  The rest of the cast, including Rosario Dawson, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, Devin Aoki, Carla Gugino, Alexis Bledel, Nicky Katt, and even Miller himself, give memorable performances.  Rodriguez (who shares the directing credit with Miller, and Quentin Tarantino even helms a scene as well) uses the comics as directly as possible: from using Miller's art as storyboards to using the dialogue almost exactly, Sin City is easily the most faithful comic adaptation of all time.

I loved the visual stuff, the plot and the storyline. I thought Bruce Willis, Mickie Rourke, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro were Brilliant! It reminded me of Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino had a little to do with this film and it shows)when you know the middle (because it is shown at the beginning), and you have to follow the story and arrive back at the middle and see it to the end. If you like movies like ""Sixth Sense"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and the ""Others"" (although that was not one of my favorites), you will understand and appreciate Sin City.

5301941,B004SIPA0A, AIZICD5W0PLF5,2.0," Great Movie, lame DVD","I am a big fan of Frank Miller, the Sin City comic book series, Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, pretty much all of the actors in the film, and the film itself.  I loved this movie, it was like a dream come true for me, being such a huge fan of the comic and the author to see him come together with my favorite director, Robert Rodriguez.  The film turned out great, was totally faithful to the point that it LOOKS like the comic book.  Its just a great movie, i'll leave it at that.<br /><br />That much said, the DVD is weak.  There is one special feature, and there is nothing special about it.  Its like a 10 minute (if that) junket that pretty much only serves to advertise the movie.  Weak sauce.  There are three incredibly cool and creative people involved with making this movie, plus this movie is shot and put together in such a cool way, its a disservice NOT to have special features about the making of this movie.  Besides that they could also have features about the comic book, etc...<br /><br />Even if they didnt do that much... aside from ""The Faculty"" what Robert Rodriguez DVD has not come with ""Ten Minute Film School"" and a commentary track?!?!? None that I can think of....  So i was pretty let down.<br /><br />Anway, you have to get the DVD if you want to watch the cool movie at home, but i would hope that there is a better version on its way.",Sin City
5301942,B004SIPA0A, A13W4PVLAQMWH3,5.0, A surprisingly sophisticated movie!,"I've surprised several people by telling them that I believe ""Sin City"" is one of the best movies of the year. Such a claim is surprising both because ""Sin City"" is not generally the kind of movie I like (or so it would appear) and because it doesn't seem to be the type of movie that could be thought of as great. Entertaining, yes. Great, no.<br /><br />But this movie is indeed great. It is obviously visually innovative and pleasing, taking film noir to the next level. But the subjects the movie delves into--and the way it deals with them--make ""Sin City"" stand out. Because, underneath all the flash, ""Sin City"" is actually (and don't laugh!) a sophisticated examination of the nature of morality.<br /><br />The world of ""Sin City"" is a world where those institutions and people who are generally seen as bastions of morality turn out to be highly immoral--most notably the church and the police. This could easily lead to the conclusion that Sin City is a place devoid of moral values, and with the amount of deviant behavior in this film, that's an easy judgment to reach.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is a three-part story, with each part revolving around one of three men: Marv (Mickey Rourke), Dwight (Clive Owen), and John Hartigan (Bruce Willis). Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan each devote themselves fully to protecting a woman, to the point that killing--and possibly dying--for her sake become necessary actions.<br /><br />What makes ""Sin City"" compelling is that although Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan would certainly fail to live up to most moral standards--not only do they kill for their women, they do so without remorse or hesitation--you end up seeing these men as heroes. You want them to succeed; you begin to understand their choices, and you start to believe that not to kill in defense of these women actually might be offensive.<br /><br />In other words, Marv, Dwight, and Hartigan are most certainly ""good"" characters in the eyes of the audience. Does this mean that they are simply the least immoral in a world filled only with immoral people? Perhaps. But ""Sin City"" is world of extraordinary situations, and these men are able to fight against those situations in the defense of an ideal--namely, the safety and redemption of a worthy woman. In this light, ""Sin City"" caused me to reflect on my own potential actions in certain situations. There are things every person would be willing to kill or die for, whether it be one's child or one's country. How do you determine what is worth killing for? Is such a killing moral, immoral, or outside of morality? Does your attitude towards such killing make it moral: in other words, must you be regretful and remorseful for it to be moral? I think that it is clear that when we are pushed to our limits, the laws of conventional morality bend. ""Sin City"" does a remarkably good job of presenting three men who are each pushed far beyond their limits, and the filmmakers leave it for the audience to decide whether these men are moral defenders or just as immoral as the people they come up against.<br /><br />In light of this, I highly recommend this film, both to those who are looking for an entertaining movie and to those who are in search of a thought-provoking one. That ""Sin City"" can appeal to both types of people demonstrates just how great this film is.",Sin City
5301943,B004SIPA0A, A1WB5NZYY5XR8A,4.0, If only Rodriguez were as good as Miller,"Good things come to those who wait. And it's been a long wait to see Frank Miller's Sin City come to the big screen. As an avid fan of all the original Sin City graphic novels, and indeed anything by Frank Miller, the wait was almost too long.<br /><br />When I heard Robert Rodriguez had snatched the rights to do the film I was both disappointed and intrigued. Frank Miller's Sin City books had been a hot commodity in Hollywood for some time, but Miller is one of those oh-so-rare artist who'd rather see the integrity of the work be upheld than make a quick buck. He knew Hollywood would never tell his stories his way. So how did Rodriguez, the Hollywood maverick who built his success off the Spy Kids franchise, land the rights? By adapting one of Miller's short stories into a 5-minute film complete with full special effects and a name actor in Josh Hartnett. Miller who is reputed to have said something along the lines of, ""this isn't a test screening, this is the opening of the film,"" was immediately sold on the project. Such was his dedication to bringing Miller's vision to the screen that he made Miller co-director of the film losing his DGA membership in the process.<br /><br />In the post-Lord of the Rings era we've seen what a small-time director can do with passion, dedication, and most importantly, a love of the source material. Peter Jackson did it, and Sam Raimi is re-affirming it with Spider-man. Would Robert Rodriguez be next? Yes and no.<br /><br />Sin City is an almost panel for panel direct adaptation of three of Frank Miller's graphic novels (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard). In it's accuracy, Rodriguez's dedication to the material is clear. But where Frank Miller is a master of visual storytelling (in his medium), Rodriguez is not. Where Frank Miller is a master of written dialogue, the delivery of the same words in the film comes off corny at times. There's a part where Michael Madsen delivers some lines so bad you'll swear you've seen better in an elementary school play. And I fault the directing for that.<br /><br />As long as you understand you aren't watching Raging Bull (probably the last great black & white film) and that this is fiction at it's pulpiest, you'll discover the film isn't bad. But it isn't for everyone. Sin City chock full of gun-toting machoism and boob-showing sexism, and I suspect many of the female persuasion won't get as much out of it as we men. But that's a good thing for those of us who don't want to see our films made metro-sexual. And when I say macho, I don't mean crap like Steven Seagal movies or all these new movies with gangsta-rappers who wanna be film stars. Frank Miller digs to the core of the male psyche and unearths real masculinity even if it is taken to the near-absurd by the outlandish characters he creates. Sin City is macho in ways that Hollywood will probably never understand.<br /><br />So is it worth seeing? If you like violent, sexy, noir pulp-fiction then definately. If you like the books, this is about as an accurate translation you've ever could have seen. The only real problem with this film is that Robert Rodriguez is not nearly as skilled in his craft as Frank Miller is in his. Regardless, if there is a sequal, I'll be first in line.",Sin City
5301944,B004SIPA0A, A3EYOITBD7ZXOV,3.0, Damn Good...But For How Long?,"I'll be honest with you...I went to the theater to see this, and walked out shortly after the horrible exchange of dialogue between Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen at the beginning.<br /><br />Bad mistake.<br /><br />It arrived on DVD, and out of absolute boredom I suppose, I purchased a copy telling myself, ""I'll give it a chance.""  Glad I am.  Good it was.  Now I realize you're not reading ""Newsweek"" or something so I won't go into every single pro and con of this film but I'll tell you one thing---it's action packed, it's gritty, it's sexy, it's clever...and there are some REALLY bad performances at the first.  Somehow Michael Madsen drags Bruce Willis' performance down, because later on in the film, Willis returns to his former glory.  Perhaps because by then he's paired with Jessica Alba, and not the fat-guy from Reservoir Dogs.<br /><br />Finally, I guess I was trying to give this three and a half stars, because it's really better than a flat three, but not quite a four, if ""Batman Begins"" is a five.  What really hurts this film in the long-run will be it's playback value.  I know what happens.  The big BANG! SHOCK! is over.  As much as I loved it, and though it's sitting on my shelf, I haven't yet forced myself to watch it twice.  I WILL...eventuallly...but what about three times?

All word of mouth I heard said it was alright. I wanted to see it because it was something new. Making film into a comic book rather than movies like Batman Begins and Spiderman where the comic book is adapted to a movie. So my mind set was positive. However, this translation from page to celluloid gets annoying. True, some shots looked amazing with the black and white and bits of red. It really is cool in the beginning; however, the viewer becomes numb to it after a half hour and then you have to watch it like it's just another movie. And as far as movies go, it's not that hot. The film noir that the movie was going for seemed less like a movie of that genre than a spoof on it. The male leads were able to pull of some of the lines, but Frank Miller can't write a female character to save his life. I understand that Rodriguez and Miller wanted to stay rigidly true to the source material, but some of the lines should not have spoken. I'm glad Rodriguez was able to but together such good actors, because a group of less talented ones would not be able to control their giggles.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke shines as Marv, but his story is less entertaining than that of Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba. Clive Owen does a great job as Dwight, but the storyline is barely amusing.<br /><br />The greatest parts of the movie are the opening scene and Bruce Willis's final scene.

5301958,B004SIPA0A, A3AQDK1F0YQKAS,4.0, Sin City Breaks the Mold,"Wow. 'Sin City' is an uncompromising, no-holds barred, in your face, brutal, raw, and savage cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions. This is an instant classic, but be warned, it's not for the faint of heart or those who lack intestinal fortitude.<br /><br />I was blown away by the look and feel of this movie. It's so dark and gritty that one can practically taste the blood and evil that oozes off the screen. The characters, heroes and villains and alike were seriously hardcore, and so real their presence was undeniable. What I particularly liked was that the heroes were more like anti-heroes, Marv in particular, whose character traits were morally ambiguous although ultimately one of the quintessential good guys.<br /><br />My hats off to Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino for pouring their heart and soul into this incredible realization of a complex and unique tale of the classic good vs. evil. Their passion for film making shows and combined with the incredible cast as well as the comic book look, they've revolutionized film making forever by combining heretofore unused styles and concepts. They took a risk by going all out as far as violence, nudity and atmosphere goes, and it paid off, big time. I can't emphasize how thrilled I am that a movie is finally made the way it was MEANT to be, rather than trying to appeal to a certain demographic, or trying to be mainstream.<br /><br />The film was quite different than I expected it to be, definitely far more violent, but it's still an experience unlike any other. Escapism at its best because it transports the audience from reality into a whole other world that is frighteningly alot like our own in many ways. A parallel world in a sense, but where the sins of mankind are put in a rather clear perspective. I liked the plot element of the church and government represented as these evil entities and what measures and ideologies that both institutions condone and sometimes embrace wholly. Granted it was extreme symbolism but not too far from the truth in terms of principle, and by juxtaposing those horrible sins of society to the backdrop of a primarily black and white existence, humanity's corruption is highlighted and contrasted, ultimately raising awareness as to how morally bankrupt our own world is, primarily on the level of men in power.<br /><br />I have seen two different half hour specials on the behind the scenes making of 'Sin City' which provides interviews with most of the cast as well as the directors and others involved with the project. It's obvious that the directors produced a labor of love, and the cast were immersed in their parts and totally dedicated to realizing Frank Miller's dream. As Miller said himself, this film is a dream come true.<br /><br />About the only thing I didn't like about the film was Bruce Willis' character's ending. To me that contradicted his gumption and integrity, and really didn't make too much sense.<br /><br />That aside, the film is brilliant on all levels. For once CGI was used properly and complemented the story and characters rather than becoming the focal point. I enjoyed the humor in this film, and it was nice with some comic relief in such a dark and disturbing setting. If you're a fan of action films and comic books set to a solid, deep story, by all means see this film.",Sin City
5301959,B004SIPA0A, A1XVYE0A34BDKR,5.0, This generation's Road warrior,"My prediction: Sin City will become the Road Warrior of the next 10 years.  That movie also was considered a bit cultish on its release and wasn't a huge theatrical success.  But through word of mouth it became one of the most popular films among young and youngish males.  Sin City will do the same.<br /><br />This movie brings to life what comic books really feel like in the mind of the reader (albeit a comic book directed at young male adults).  Clearly the direct involvement of Frank Miller (author of the comic books) played a key role in the success, although I couldn't imagine a better choice for director than Robert Rodriguez.<br /><br />All of the stories are interesting and visually compelling, but very violent.  To me, though, the violence was not disturbing because it was delivered in a highly stylized manner.  It's impossible to explain the look and feel of the film because there's no precedent.  It succeeds (and then some) at what ""The Crow"" only hinted at.  Key to the success is that they didn't try to make this believable in a real world context.  There's a license to create a world that could only exist in comic books and that license is fully utilized.  The way people talk and act and the look of the world they live in is disturbingly unreal and that's as it should be, it's based on a comic book after all. There's no attempt, as in so many other comic book adaptations (Spiderman, X-Men, etc.), to make it appear that this is the real world and comic book characters just happen to inhabit our world. I like that.<br /><br />The stunner for me was Mickey Rourke in the opening of three loosely connected stories.  In this performance, Rourke does not appear to be an actor giving an impression of a character in a comic book world.  He makes us feel like a window has been opened and we are watching someone who lives in that world.  A truly stunning performance.<br /><br />This film no doubt has many detractors who aggravate over excessive violence, misogyny, etc.  These people don't get it and should stay away from a film like this in the first place.  Sin City is making no attempt to please everybody.  To me it's refreshing that someone took a risk instead of making movies by polls and committee, which is how so many awful movies get realized.  I can't guarantee that you'll love this movie.  But I can pretty much guarantee that, if you read all the reviews and know what to expect going in, and you still decide to go ahead, then you will love this.",Sin City

It's a genre movie, one of the very best of its kind, worth having in your personal library.  The fascinating thing about Miller's graphic novel series -- and this movie -- is the way it mirrors the city and county of Los Angeles and all their corruption.  That I grew up there -- and have since learned enough about the politics of water, one of the major reasons for that corruption (for more on which, see Marc Reisner's in-depth tour de force on the subject, CADILLAC DESERT:  THE AMERICAN WEST AND ITS DISAPPEARING WATER [Penguin Books:  1986, ISBN 0014-010432-1];  it's enough to make your hair stand on end, and gives the perfect subtext for SIN CITY) to make me swear I'll never go back there.  Ever -- adds enormously to its power, but non-Angelenos, current or former, will find it just as overwhelming as I have.  Nobody does it better than Frank Miller -- except for the producer, director, and actors who together lifted SIN CITY, the movie, light-years above so much of the other current and past cinematic fare.

Yes, it is difficult to believe that a single man could take on a squad of fully armored riot police and win.  These are not what make this movie what it is.  What makes this movie one of the best I have seen in years lies in three areas:<br /><br />The first is believability of character.  I never onced doubted the  truth of these characters, definitely a testament to the skill of the actors involved.<br /><br />The second is a distinct and totally immersive style.  The colors the lighting all serve to bring you completely into Sin City.  This is due mainly to the films close adherence to the books it was based on. In fact with the exception of a few lines of dialog , Director Robert Rodriguez could not have adhered more closely to the comics.<br /><br />The third, and most important to me, is the completely real morality of this movie.  Morality in life is never black and white, although we might like it to be, it is always shades of gray.  This departure from your standard hollywood trash really puts this one over into 5star category.  This is one case where ambiguous is not a bad thing.  They are not all bad and they are not all good, they fall right in where the rest of us are.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, it comes with a very interesting behind the scenes featurette with cast interviews.  The DVD also shipped to me with a limited edition slipcover which is definitely an incentive to order early.<br /><br />In summary this film has incredible style, raw emotion and a refreshing realistic morality.

Well, I haven't read any of Frank Miller's legendary ""Sin City"" comics, but having seen the movie, I can't imagine it existing without them.Many people will see similarities between ""Sin City"" and the work of Quentin Tarantino, both because Robert Rodriquez will probably never break free from this stigma no matter how many kiddie flicks he makes, and more importantly -- gulp -- he actually inviteds QT on board to direct one of the segments, this after he'd torn up his DGA membership card in disgust after they wouldn't allow him to list Frank Miller as a co-director, so as far as integrity goes it's hard to one-up Sir Robert here.  I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to which segment QT was supposed to be directing ahead of viewing this flick, and it's to the film's credit that it all seems of a piece no matter how the chores were divvied up.<br /><br />Now, there are a couple of things that are immediately going to weed out a certain part of the older audience (hello Ma!), this being the ""artsy"" use of black-and-white splashed here and there with purposeful primary colors, and also the integrity of the action sequences.  I shouldn't diss the so-called ""older"" audience, being in my third decade of existence myself, but my parents and everyone else their age have certain prejudices toward a particular kind of modern film, this being the type that has ""far fetched"" action sequences.  Yes, in ""Sin City"" the characters are able to take a ridiculous amount of bullets and keep on ticking as well as jumping out of windows several stories to the ground without any apparent injuries, but to that I say that there is a reason this kind of thing works in a film like ""Sin City"" whereas it can easily wear thin in a movie like, say, ""The Matrix"".  Sin City is portrayed as a hopelessly fatalistic backdrop against which the best the characters can hope for is to die with a little bit of dignity.  It doesn't really matter that Marv doesn't croak after taking a bullet to the head because you know the dice are gonna roll cold for him sooner or later.Another comparison people may make to Tarantino is to point out that ""Sin City"" is also an anthology film.  I could mention the fact that this is based on three graphic novels featuring different protagonists and leave it at that, but -- at the risk of unduly diminishing the genius of Quentin Tarantino, whose ""Pulp Fiction"" is undeniably the most influential film of the 90s and a work of art in it's own right -- it should be noted that QT did not, in fact, actually INVENT the anthology film.  No, that would be George Romero and Stephen King with ""Creepshow"" (I'm kidding, of course, but you get my point...).<br /><br />Aside from the anthology aspect, there is one thing that actually does somewhat resemble ""Pulp Fiction"":  Bruce Willis' character makes an early exit only to return later in the film.  It's not the same chronological gimmick that QT utilized but I've said enough as it is.The one aspect that got so much press in the film's pre-release was the unprecedented decision to film the entire movie in front of a green screen.  This move not only doesn't come off as a gimmick but you'll find yourself forgetting that ""Sin City"" isn't absolutely real about five minutes into the movie.  Sure, there are numerous improbabilities, as detailed above, but it's the MOVEMENT of the characters, vehicles, weapons, etc. that seem a bit cartoonish;  nothing about the actual scenery really does.  In essence, ""Sin City"" sticks to the elements that continue to make noir so compelling:  great camerawork, gritty characterizations, and the theme of a hardened soul holding out some kind of remote hope for redemption.  Bruce Willis was an absolute no-brainer for this flick:  he's spent the last decade perfecting this world-weary gutter saint character, and ""Sin City"" is arguably his best portrait of this tortured soul archetype yet.  Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke are the three main protagonists, and you'll find yourself rooting for them not through point-of-view bias alone, but because each of these guys completely earns the right to be called a bad ass.  In a way I'm glad they saved the fate of Willis' character for last as the whole movie seems to be building to such tragedy.<br /><br />So, yes, it's unfortunate that so many people will rent this movie sheerly on the recommendation of Mr. Skin, but hopefully ""Sin City"" will turn more than a few heads on to a new, hightened quality of experimental film-making in the same way that the aforementioned ""Pulp Fiction"" did a decade ago.  Word is that Rodriquez is planning two back-to-back sequels as we speak.",Sin City

Just about no one else is that easy to place.<br /><br />This movie is the best in a lot of different directions. For one, it's at the top of the new noir. Everything and everyone has a dark edge; the good guys have a bad edge, and the bad guys have a really bad edge, and some of them are just over over the edge. Just about every scene is night, a dark time for the dark businesses of murder and revenge. And best, this isn't just one story, it's three or four that wind together.<br /><br />It's also probably the best comic book adaptation ever. The comic's original writer and artist, Frank Miller, was co-director, and he brought these stories to their dark, gritty life the way it needed to be done. The actors put in some memorable performances, too - Elijah Wood's ""Kevin"" is no hobbit, not even a little. The script is close to the original, but the visuals are so true to Miller's chiaroscuro art that it's incredible.<br /><br />This is also one of the most creative, pointed uses of color in any movie I've ever seen. It's black and white, with the emphasis on the black - like the characters themselves, there's not a lot of gray in the middle. That makes every spot of color matter, starting with that first red dress and soft mouth full of red lipstick. Goldie's hair, Cindy's eyes, that yellow b*st*rd, and blood. Lots of blood. Sometimes, though the blood turns black as death, or glows white like molten metal - the color (or lack) conveys the mood better than literality ever could.<br /><br />It's not for the squeamish, though. The hookers and strippers do their work out of sight, but the violence gets pretty raw. It's a raw story, though.<br /><br />And it's great. It's not at literate as the Maltese Falcon, maybe, but it's a comic book, and great within its kind.<br /><br />//wiredweird",Sin City
5301972,B004SIPA0A, A3T225F764I9FW,5.0, Truly lives up to my expectations of R.Rodriges,"I`ve always liked a lot what R.Rodriges has been making and this film is not exception, moreover he ( with a help of people like K.Tarantino and the author of the comic book ) goes further, digging real deep, exploring new levels of movie production. Here I wanna save all the technical details and stuff, since other people, among them-pro actors,have already done it in their reviews. I just want to point out at the reaction in the auditorium when I watched this stunning and breathtaking action. At first there were some laughs and jokes and giggling as the movie started-there are some episodes, unrealistic scenes-like ""Marv"", Mickey Rourke`s character, being hit by a car multiply,just stands up and keeps going as if nothing has happened-but you always keep in mind that that is a comic book movie version and it`s the way it`s supposed to be. And later on all laughs and jokes and stuff in the audience go down and then you can`t help but sence electricity in the air and tension all around-you yourself is a whole rack of nerves ready to explode...incredible feeling, I would even say there some emotions there not experienced by you before-probably that`s why there are so many dislikers out there-they`re just scared to death being dragged out of the ""BOX"" where they tend to live and function, and unfortunately, I hate to say that, in this country number of those people-who just ""live comfortably"" and see nothing but their narrow world around their eyes more and more increases in overwhelming tempo...I`m sorry, it can seem to have nothing to do with the movie itself, but I just tried to ground my theory about the audience that is far from being fans of this movie.<br /><br />  So everybody-if you like to experience new things, explore new horizons and live-not to just exist-go to see the movie-you`ll be truly amazed and shaken. Thank you.",Sin City

The story sort of comes full cicrle at the end, which in my opinion saved this film from the mere 1-start I would have given it.<br /><br />Amazon.com's editor, David Horiuchi, found the film to be ""unquestionably the most faithful comic-book-based movie ever made."" I do agree with him and I also think that because it was so faitful to the comic books, it failed to grab the audience emotionally.<br /><br />You won't feel for the characters of this film, I tell ya this much. They're beautiful, stylish and deadly, but they are not relatable.<br /><br />This film has got to be seen on the big screen to fully appreciate its artistry. It's very entertaining to watch, even though it gets overly gory in some scenes.",Sin City
5301974,B004SIPA0A, ANMFFCVZ3KM81,5.0, Go see this Film NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Based on the graphic novels of Frank Miller, this is a movie that you'll either love or hate immediately. Directed by Robert Rodriguez, Quentin Tarantino, and Miller himself, this film is ultra violence and ultra risqu&eacute;. Filmed in black and white with hint of coloring throughout, this film is exquisite. It's a combination film noire 1940's style detective novel meets Pulp Fiction, and I just loved it.<br /><br />The film is a culmination of several short stories, all intermingled. From the opening sequence to the ending credits, the film seizes hold of the audience, and dares you not to be entertained. The black and white is grand and enveloping; which tones down the blood splatter being spewed across the screen. This effect turns a would-be mad-slasher movie into cinematic genius.<br /><br />This film has everything, from the A-List of stars which include: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, and Elijah Wood playing some sort of flesh-eating psycho that's just too cool for words and a far cry from his Frodo character of the last five years; to over the top storylines with ninja hookers, dirty cops, unstoppable vengeful superhuman hit-men, carnivorous were-boys, IRA mercenary militia and corrupt politicians. It's everything that you could ever want in a movie and more.<br /><br />To try to explain the movie in words, would take to long, and would end up incoherent; let's just suffice it to say, ""You'll have to see it to believe it,"" and leave it at that. I must also reiterate that this film is very adult oriented; if you're easily offended or overly sensitive to adult content and graphic subject matter, then I would think twice before viewing.

5301978,B004SIPA0A, A1LBAC84TLIGAX,5.0, A STUNNING MASTERPIECE  9.5 OUT OF 10,"Sin City quite simply is jaw-dropping. What more could you ask for? An all-star cast, a striking visual look, brilliant storytelling, a crazed and rather demented cast of characters, and well-executed action scenes. Sin City is easily one of the greatest films of all time (The Internet Movie Database also backs this up, considering it's on the top 250 list). This is easily one of the best films I've ever seen. It's not quite perfect, but almost.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The film is comprised of three separate storylines, all taking place in Sin City. One story focuses on a disgraced cop accused of kidnapping and child molestation after being framed by a powerful political individual who will not let his son be brought to justice for his crimes against little girls. Now the cop must protect a stripper (a girl who is now 19 he rescues at the beginning of the film from the crazed child molester.) and prevent her from being hunted down by her kidnapper, raped, and killed. The second storyline focuses on a man who is out to seek revenge for his murdered girlfriend Goldie, while running from the police because he has been accused of the murder by a powerful religious official, and now he has to find the killer and the religious official responsible for it while having the girl's twin sister tag along with him. The third story focuses a man named Dwight who defends his girlfriend from her violent ex-boyfriend and her Old Town Girls (A homicidal gang of gorgeous prostitutes who run the Old Town section of Sin City), when the Old Town Girls accidentally kills a group undercover cops, Dwight is tasked with getting rid of the bodies to protect their reign over Old Town and not anger the police and mobsters and have them come after them.<br />MUSIC: The musical score was excellent and fit the film perfectly through every moment.<br />ACTION: This film is modeled like an old black and white film, with small touches of color here and there. The action scenes are quite brutal and disturbing at times, but are loaded with shootouts and dismemberments of people. The action scenes were well done, but this film is definitely not for kids at all.<br />ACTING: The acting was really good, which is no surprise considering the all-star cast of people. The dialogue was also good, and it did feel believable. Unfortunately, I do have to complain that sometimes the dialogue got a little long-winded and dragged on. This is only a small complaint though, but it does put a blemish on this film.<br />OVERALL: This is a must-have for any DVD collection. This film is totally brilliant and well-executed in every regard.<br />THE GOOD: The striking visual style, the action scenes, the acting and actors, the brilliant storytelling, and the great music.<br />THE BAD: Moments of long-winded dialogue.",Sin City
5301979,B004SIPA0A, A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP,3.0, Newsflas,"Not surprisingly most of the rumours circulating about this film (as it is with most films for that matter) were inaccurate. Not all, but most.<br /><br />It was supposed to be ultraviolent to the point where it could disturb some viewers. Not the case. Aside of one single scene everything else we've seen before on this violence level. In fact, to me this film worked more as a very dark comedy than anything else.<br /><br />Then again it turned out being very close to an art-noir film, something not included in all the talk before the film was released. It has all the characteristics of being artsy: clever and intriguing use of color, surreal city-scapes etc.<br /><br />Where it falters is (again not surprisingly) in character development. Keeping in mind that it's based on a comic, we should rememebr that when one reads a comic he builds the characters himself. You tend to attribute traits to characters as you read a comic or a book because your imagination plays a much more active role compared to watching a film. It's the difference of the medium that dictates this.<br /><br />In Sin City most of the characters are shallow with the exception of Bruce Willis who's given unequally more depth than the rest. At some point it all gets too close to a very stylistic but smallminded slug fest where body parts are flying away , various characters are blasted to smithereens, chopped or gunned down.<br /><br />But still the film works, mainly because of its unique premise that there's no hero on the good side involved. Everyone in Sin City is a doomy shady character, every relationship has a strong dark side, every mission has evil intentions, the whole city lives and breathes under dim ominous lights. That's the biggest success of the director and his crew, that they managed to bring acroos this atmosphere very convincingly indeed while delivering it with an artistic overtone.<br /><br />Despite the shortcomings, Sin City is worth watching and if the other rumours are true (i.e the creators planning to turn this into a long lasting movie series) it's obviously bound for commercial success as well.<br /><br />But having spoken of very dark comedy, the very first 40 minutes where Mickey Rourke is involved are gonna draw some serious laughs from those with a more flexible sense of humor. This is a character where the word ""unsubtle"" applies with a vengeance.<br /><br />As far as Rodriguez is concerned Sin City is easily an improvement over Once Upon A Time In Mexico. There could be further development from him to see.",Sin City

What a relentlessly gruesome, amoral, soul-deadening slice of grindhouse pulp.<br /><br />And yet, what fun it is to look at, and how entertaining and involving it becomes.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is a perfect example of the kind of film where the talents at work totally overwhelm the subject matter, resulting in a work of art that is much better than it needs to be but is ultimately chained down by the nature of its content. Director Robert Rodriguez, guest director Quentin Tarantino, and a splendid cast of not simply big names but iconic ones squeeze every inch of mileage they can get out of what amount to three stories that really only exist to string along scenes of ever-mounting, sadistic violence that is so shocking that I can't believe it can pass for mainstream entertainment. Simply put, the R-rating for this film is a joke-- even Takashi Miike's ""Audition,"" Gasper Noe's ""Irreversible,"" Scorcese's ""Casino,"" and Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" don't match ""Sin City"" for sheer brutality. Forget about ""Kill Bill""; it's not even in the same category.<br /><br />And yet, somehow, the sheer momentum and energy carries the viewer through. Every image oozes style and cool, and the atmosphere is so thoroughly badass that you end up getting swept away despite yourself. Never mind that (SPOILER) the only characters with any moral fiber whatsoever end up dead (END SPOILER). Never mind that the women are either sluts or hookers and the men are murderers and villains. Never mind that there's not an ounce of value that emerges from ""Sin City""'s barrage of ugly cynicism. If you watch this film, you will be unable to take your eyes from it. That's some achievement, given what actually happens on screen. Heck, this movie even survives relentlessly bad performances by its two key female leads; the beautiful, talented Rosario Dawson dons a sexy outfit, but hams it up a little too much; and the significantly less beautiful, less talented actress whom I know only as ""that irritating bitch from the ""Gilmore Girls"" and who singlehandedly undermines the movie's credibility whenever she steps on screen.<br /><br />Also, I've got to admit that I've got a certain amount of love for any action movie that earns its R rating in this era of neutered, PG-13 rated flicks where the trailers are more sexy and violent than the actual films. I'll take ""Sin City"" and ""Bad Boys II,"" flawed though they may be, over ""The Bourne Supremecy"" any day of the week.<br /><br />Still, in spite of what's been accomplished here as far as pure filmmaking goes, you can't help but wonder what the people involved in this project could have done with a more imaginative, if equally pulpy, set of stories.",Sin City

But I finally got a chance to see this film, a joint effort of graphic novelist Frank Miller and film director Robert Rodriguez, and was frankly bored by it after about half an hour (and I think I'm being generous there!). All the storylines---Bruce Willis' attempt to protect a young stripper (Jessica Alba), Mickey Rourke's attempt to avenge a prostitute's (Jaime King) death, Clive Owen's attempt to put down a thug (Benicio del Toro) and his misogynistic ways---are done in a film noir style that is unfortunately ALL style. There's no psychological depth to any of the characters as there are in other comic book adaptations (BATMAN BEGINS is an exemplary recent example); it's all just a soulless geek show. A fantastic looking, often atmospheric geek show, but a geek show nevertheless. If appearances are all that matter to you, than SIN CITY will probably be a ball (and the visuals are the only reasons I'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of just 1).

5301983,B004SIPA0A, AL277B4AQCWBG,3.0," Technically interesting, but no heart","Three stories from Frank Miller's celebrated series of graphic novels are loosely intertwined here in what is undoubtedly a highly personal project for director Robert Rodriguez and co-director Miller. The film certainly captures the visceral nature of Miller's work, with its curious focus on genital mutilation and dismemberment (but is surprisingly coy when it comes to Miller's penchant for nudity). As an experiment in aesthetics, it works - it's fun, it's technically interesting. As a film for an audience of more than two? Well, that's something else. The three narratives are insufficiently connected for this ever to gel as a single piece, and whatever chance you have of immersing yourself in the Sin City universe is constantly undermined by the insistent use of voiceover narration. You're never allowed to fall into the world, but are instead distracted by a never-ending string of ""hard boiled"" one-liners that describe precisely what you're seeing on screen or could reasonably deduce from the performances if the camera were ever allowed truly to capture them. These could be interesting stories about complex, damaged people, but Rodriguez fails to get the most out of the material because he doesn't seem to trust it - nor himself. In his obsession to replicate the precise look of what's on the page, he fails to use more of the power of the screen - strong performances, real atmosphere, temporal and aural control rather than just visual style. It leaves me wondering why he bothered. If you're not going to use the power of the other register, why bother with a transposition? The result is a film that's technically accurate, visually stunning, but ringingly hollow at the core.  And violent. Violence is justifiable in the context of a story, but this whole piece seems overly cruel as a way of masking its lack of character, humanity and meaning.  And rather than growing out of the long noir tradition, it feels like a postmodern hijacking of it.  Worse, it isn't even hijacked for good reason - it doesn't add to the tradition, nor critique it, nor say anything new or interesting about it, nor refresh it by flipping it into an unexpected context (as Rian Johnson did so effectively with ""Brick"".).  Miller has said repeatedly that his central theme is love.  But in a town this self-indulgently violent and artfully superficial, it's hard to take that claim seriously.",Sin City

5301985,B004SIPA0A, A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,4.0, One wild ride...,"This is a love-it or hate-it movie if ever there was one.  Most of the audience that I saw it with loved it, but my friend thought it was the worst movie he'd ever seen.  Of course, he's not into comic books.  The real significance of this film is that (with the possible exception of the Hulk) this is the movie that most captures the feel of a comic book.  Not only does it feel like ""a comic book"" - it feels like THE comic book, Sin City.<br /><br />Sin City is a series of black and white graphic novels in the ""noir"" style by Frank Miller.  Miller shares directing credit on this film, along with Roberto Rodriguez.  Not only was Miller on set every day but the film IS ALMOST A SHOT-FOR-SHOT TRANSLATION OF THE GRAPHIC NOVELS.  I've only read the first in the series, but I don't really feel the need to read the other two that this film is based on because I believe they will be exactly the same.  Rodriguez has used the panels from the comics as storyboards and re-created them as faithfully as possible.<br /><br />The film of Sin City is also the first film to capture the modern conception of comic book violence.  Remember the good old days when the term ""comic book violence"" referred to superheroes like Captain America duking it out and never suffering greater injury than a black eye?  Not any more.  In the adult, gritty comics, the emphasis is on pain, torture, sadism, and especially dismemberment - I lost track of how many characters get dismembered.  This is possibly the most violent and goriest movie I have ever seen.  Because it is mostly in black and white, blood shows up white.  Characters take and dish out more punishment than could ever be possible in real life.<br /><br />Possibly, the people who do not like this film are put off by its gruesomeness.  I don't know if the audience is meant to take pleasure in the torturing of the bad guys simply because they are villains.  Certainly, there are no ""good guys"" in this movie - just anti-heroes (with the possible exception of the Bruce Willis character).<br /><br />Also, people who are not into comic books may have a hard time with the film.  Most of talking in the movie comes from voice-over narration because 1) it is a nod to film noir and 2) it is an almost direct transcription of the comic book.  However, I've never seen voice-over used this extensively, and - as the movie Adaptation tells us - voice-over is a cinematic no-no.  Some people may be put off by it.<br /><br />Regardless, I've never seen a movie ANYTHING like this before.  If you're into graphic novels, film noir, or over-the-top comic-book violence - or just movies with an original voice - check it out.<br /><br />SPECIAL NOTE: This is NOT a movie for little kids and I was horrified to see parents taking their toddlers into the theater.",Sin City

Not that that's really a bad thing, the sin city comics were great and this movie was perfect. It's obvious that Robert Rodriguez didn't make an adaptation of Frank Miller's comics, he basically put the books onscreen. And I mean he made the movie exactly like the books right down to the teeth. The look of this movie is so great I consider it eye candy. I love how the movie was shot in front of the green screen (even though that's totally unethical movie making) to make the picture look just like the black and white world of Frank Miller. The action was also very good, especially the fight between Kevin (Elijah) and Marv (Mickey). My complaints we're that a couple of the main character's acting was pretty stiff. It's obvious that no matter who she plays and how beautiful she is that Jessica Alba isn't a very good actress. Also suprisingly Clive Owen was probably the worst actor on the screen. He could have added so much more depth and realizm to Dwight but he screwed that up. I don't mean to be picky but Nick Stahl is a good actor but it was something about him that made him not capture the creepyness and bad guy feel of yellow bastard. My only complaints were some of the acting. Although Brittany Murphy, Benecio del Turro, Bruce Willis, and Mickey Rourke were very good at there parts. If your a fan of the movie you'll love it, if your not you will still love it. And by the way let's talk about the violence. I can't make up my mind on whether or not it was normal for an R rated movie or if it was too overdone. Because a lot of the blood is computerized to look white. When Jackie Boy got his hand cut off it looked like bird crap was coming out of his wrist. Most of the blood though is red or black, and it seems to flow from the characters like water a lot of the time and is all over the place. Plus there is some nudity. So not appropriate for some viewers, not to mention the castrating.",Sin City

That is, first release a bare bones edition of a DVD and then release a ""special edition"" a while later.  Such is the case with Sin City.  Robert Rodriguez' Sin City special edition DVD will reportedly give viewers the option of watching each individual story line seperate from one another like three mini-movies.  It will also aparently contains footage not seen in the theatrical version of the film.  I plan to rent this version  of the Sin City DVD and wait for the better release to actually buy it.<br /><br />(I was right: the special edition kills.)",Sin City
5301988,B004SIPA0A, A29R4FCO6RFX4K,5.0, Fantastic comic book movie,"Of all the comic-book movies that have been made, from Flash Gordon to The Fantastic Four in 2005, this is liable to score a premier spot in the `fan satisfaction' division. No niggling here along the lines of ""Spider-Man shouldn't have organic web-shooters"" or ""Batman's parents shouldn't be shot by the Joker"". This collaboration between two one-man bands, comic-book writer-artist Frank Miller and director-writer producer Robert Rodriguez, is as authentic to the source material as those cheapo '60s Marvel cartoons that panned over panels from the caricatures while narrative artists read out the word balloons.<br /><br />Like most flourishing comics, Sin City created a decipherable concrete-but-unreal humanity. Miller mixed a stew of thugs in trench coats out of Chandler or Spillane, a spice of the `bad girl art' that made paperback covers of the 1950s stand out from newsracks and a splatter of the manga-ish stylized goriness which encouraged movies buffs like Quentin Tarantino (who guest-directs one scene) have only recently discovered. The movie candidly matches the look of the comic: stark black-and-white images, with the occasional shocking or beautiful splash of rich color. Most modern noirs incline to the blacker side of monochrome, but Miller's scratchboard techniques, custom-made superbly by Rodriguez, often get the most impact out of white - the blank round reflections of a killer's sunglasses, crosses of sticking-plaster on a much-wounded face, arterial gushes of opaque blood.<br /><br />The movie script also matches the original stories virtually word for word. The original mini-series was about Marv (perfectly incarnated here by comeback kid Mickey Rourke) a relentless but sympathetic freak who avenges the murder of his love by taking on a grisly cannibal (a blank-faced, far-from-Frodo Elijah Wood). The film adapts this (later retitled The Hard Goodbye) and two of its follow-ups including The Big Fat Kill, seemingly blas&eacute; about the similarities among the plots and characters, convinced that the seductive imagery and picturesque citizens would grasp the attention.<br /><br />Be warned, though - this is not a movie for the faint of heart. The extreme violence does get a bit obtrusive, but you can say the same for Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO and others. But to point out its graphic nature is a moot point. It is classic cinema that should be seen and appreciated for what it is-pure entertainment.",Sin City

5301990,B004SIPA0A, A3JD8FDS3CO3GH,5.0, The best movie of its kind since Pulp Fiction,"Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's Sin City is film noir for the 21st century. The type of film noir that movie audiences have never seen. It's Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler for a new generation. Unlike the writings of Spillane and Chandler, Miller's world features no heroes. Everyone is a villain in Sin City. As we know, however, villains can be good and heroes can be bad. The thin line between the two is at the heart of Sin City.<br /><br />Brilliantly written by Frank Miller and brilliantly directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez, Sin City is simply one of the most exciting, invigorating films I've ever had the pleasure to see. Movies like this are exactly why I love movies. Sin City is the cinematic art form at its peak. It's bold, passionate, imaginative, striking and uncompromising; things that 90 percent of movies today are not.<br /><br />Squeamish audiences will not be amused, however and that is to be expected. Sin City is quite an extreme film that features tons of extreme violence the likes of which is rarely seen in a Hollywood movie. Because of that, it is sure to be the subject of controversy. However if you can stomach the violence, Sin City will be a unforgettable movie going experience. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have created a world never before seen in the movies. A world that exists nowhere in reality except on the page and on the movie screen. The film must be separated from reality.  Sin City is at no time and in no way realistic, nor is it supposed to be. It's a world where the writer's imagination is the only limit. Fans of film in general and film noir in particular, fans of comics, and fans of pulp crime stories will find much to love in Sin City. I, for one, already consider this gruesome little film among my all-time favorites.<br /><br />I will not talk about the stories or the actors, save that Mickey Rourke delivers an awesome, Oscar-worthy performance. I will only say two more words: see it.",Sin City

That's a helpful insight. What's best about the movie is the visual experience. The sparing use of color, the digital experimentation, the combination of human actors and cartoon backgrounds, the voice-overs, etc. All this is very interesting and seductive to watch -- and it distances the viewer from the appalling violence, making it much easier to take and much less genuinely threatening. I really don't think anyone will be inspired to take a gun to a mob from watching this film. It's ultimately a very sophisticated cartoon.<br /><br />Well, that's also its weakness. It's ultimately a cartoon, and there is only so far that genre can take you. Tarantino, Rodriguez, Miller -- they are all geniuses in their own milieus -- but none of these is the place where you might find an actor making you believe in his real emotion or his complicated conflict -- nowhere here do you find real, muddy, complicated love -- or even real revenge even though the fake version is all over the movie. It's a two-dimensional, comic send-up of a two-dimensional cartoon. So, well, there is a limit to the profundity.<br /><br />It's also (and maybe for those reasons) a boy's movie (not a man's, not a girl's, not a woman's). It's edgy, stylish, energetic, its voice is low and growly, all the things boys are. But it's not wise or serious or beautiful. Also, while most of the casting was brilliant, Clive Owen is too pretty for his part.",Sin City

But Mickey Rourke steals the show as Marv. He's the ultimate street thug who'll take down anyone who get's in his way (and does half the time) to get his revenge. A must see for Frank Miller Fans, comic book fans, Robert Rodriguez fans, or people who just love good movies.",Sin City
5301994,B004SIPA0A, A6ADO7B6FUVN,5.0," Wicked, Dark, and Ominously Intriguing - Brilliant Film Noir","Sin City takes place within a corrupt and criminal environment where evil and suspicious characters seem to rule the city.  Daylight never seems to reach this place where human transgressions seem to be the norm, as shadows and darkness enhance the gloomy milieu in which the characters exist.  This film is the very archetype of film noir as no one can trust anyone and death lurks around every corner.  The film's heroes are less than perfect with either a dark past or they suffer from some terminal condition.  Everything is perfect in regards to film noir, yet the world is as far as possible from an utopia as life is easily expendable and everyone is guilty of something.<br /><br />In three of Frank Miller's graphic novels Sin City has generated the foundation for the films, as the audience get the opportunity to follow three disconnected adventures.  These three adventures lead the audience into a dark place, an unwanted domain if it was real, but the black and white cinematography make it look and feel like the graphic novel that Miller created.  This makes the film tolerable, as the violence is extreme, detailed, and intense.  If Sin City was shot in the spirit of Spider-Man (2002) the film would be extremely gory, grotesque, and probably would not be allowed in theater throughout the United States.  Thus, as mentioned, the black and white cinematography makes the film tolerable and viewable, but it also surpasses the cinematography from other graphic novels by light-years, as it displays brilliance.<br /><br />The adventures are all divided up by the women in the story, which are an essential part of the atmosphere of the film.  None of the women seem to be over the age of 25 while they all are prostitutes with daring clothing revealing more than covering.  The prostitution and the sexually suggestive environment intensifies the sleaziness of the criminal milieu, which enhances the distrusting atmosphere.  However, the women in Sin City are no feeble women.  These women do not mind pulling the trigger when it counts, or swinging a blade if necessary.  Nonetheless, these women also bring out the little good and human compassion, if one can call it that, which is a rare commodity in Basin City where the stories take place.<br /><br />After the film's opening the audience is introduced to the cop Harrigan (Bruce Willis) who is about to make his final arrest before retirement.  This arrest attempt leads Harrigan to reveal the location where he can find a psychopathic killer that sexually lusts for torturing young girls.  He is also aware that the pedophile has recently kidnapped a young girl named Nancy.  However, this psycho-killer is not unknown to him, as he has slipped his grasp many times before.  The psychopath is the son of the mayor, and this could lead to some major difficulty for Harrigan through the mayor's influential powers.<br /><br />Following Harrigan's case, the audience gets to follow Marv (Mickey Rourke), an ex-convict with delusional tendencies and a beautiful parole officer.  Marv has just met and had his best intimate moment with Goldie.  When Marv awakens from his sexually exhausted slumber he discovers that Goldie is dead and the cops have already been tipped.  Angry and vengeful Marv escapes the trap in order to find the true identity behind Goldie's killer, which leads the audience into a blood splattered river that flows from Marv's path.<br /><br />Shellie's (Brittany Murphy) ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) instigates the third adventure where the freedom of the girls in the Old Time comes in jeopardy, as the truce between the cops, the mob, and the prostitutes is crumbling.  The hero in this tale is Dwight (Clive Owen), a criminal with a recent face job, who turns into the knight in shining armor, but much better than in King Arthur (2004).  This sequence displays the strength that the women possess when they decide enough is enough, which of course turns very bloody.<br /><br />There are several elements in the film that make this film brilliant, but one must begin with expressing gratitude to the casting directors Beth Sepko and Mary Vernieu who put together a splendid cast.  The cast consists of actors such as Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Brittany Murphy, Clive Owen, Elijah Wood, Nick Stahl, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Jessica Alba and many others.  A couple of the highlights are Rourke's performance as Marv, as he brings out the dirty and nasty in a delusional criminal who is on a murderous destructive path while Del Toro's performance as Jackie Boy is simply excellent.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez who has directed several action films is a perfect choice to lead this project, as he also had help from Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino.  The scenes are full of speed, action, and nitty-gritty violence, which intentionally goes over the top with high frequency.  This exaggerated violence often seems humorous and will occasionally force the audience into laughter.  However, laughing at mutilation is hardly acceptable, which suggests that the audience is as guilty to the crime as the perpetrator.  This is a cleverly incorporation of the visual theme that no one is innocent, as all are guilty, even the audience members.  Furthermore, the heavy use of cerebral character monologues enhances the audience's cerebral participation in the film, as little is left for the imagination, yet it leaves the audience contemplating moral values.",Sin City

As authentic to the genre as putting dragons and wizards in an espionage film.

He also seems to enjoy portraying castrations of many types, such as gunshots to the groin, knifings, and so on.  A fun time for all.

Rodriguez did an excellenct job in bring a comic book to life.  However, some things need to stick to their original medium.  I'm counting these illogical wrecks of mini-stories as those that fit in this catagory.  After Micky Rourke's short (the best one, IMHO) I was ready for this movie to end.  Clive Owens seemed miscasted, but Benico sort of saved the day on that story, but it was still riding on the so-so part.  After that, I'm thinking surely that's the end...BUT NO.  It keeps going and going, until I'm practically begging the DVD player, please no more.  Then there's just one more bit, that I was so close to pulling my hair out, that I was relieved that it only lasted less than a minute.  Oh, Thank God.

5302002,B004SIPA0A, A148WZM02X2DVI,5.0, Miller's spirit on screen--,"Cannibal teens, psychotic hookers, talking dead bodies, yellow skinned child rapists, and a disfigured psycho with an affinity for trench coats. The third corner of hell? No, it's all mundane in Sin City, thus is the oddities presented in the Frank Miller created series of graphic novels. Miller set forth a legacy in 1991 when he created a series of incomparable visionary graphic novels called ""Sin City"" which had no superheroes, no intergalactic madmen, and no demonic entities, only the horror of mankind and the back alleys of the worst city in the world. Miller created a dark grim neo-noir series that would forever be revered among comic book creators, and when this movie was set to release, I never read any of the issues. While, being a hardcore comic geek I was aware of Sin City, I had never read the novels, and I bought them as soon as possible, and I wasn't disappointed. Perhaps it's something within mankind the series reflects, taboos that Miller tackles within the smoky haze, never-ending darkness, and introversion amidst the heroes whom are constantly teetering over to the dark side to justify the means.<br /><br />One thing Frank Miller mastered with this series was though the books basically examined evil men fighting evil men, you could easily distinguish which people were fighting for a good cause and which people weren't. ""Sin City"" is an amazing series of comic books with incredible stories of crime and vengeance and director Robert Rodriguez presents a 99 percent accurate depiction in his adaptation of the hit series. Rodriguez sacrificed a lot for the sake of converting the series to the big screen and having Miller along with him directing at his side, they created one incredible piece of filmmaking that will surely become a classic. For years, even to this day, pretentious bookworms still like to refer to comic books as nothing but a kids medium with nothing to add to intellect or even imagination, but Miller basically proved them wrong turning a kids medium into an versatile medium with series and stories worthy of literature.<br /><br />Sin City is not for kids, and as evident by the R rating, Rodriguez does not shy away from the violent content featured so prominently in the book. For people who have yet to read the books, they'll be disgusted and simply offended by the violent content featured, but the violent content does manage to bear a relevance in the books presenting the grim atmosphere present only in noir. And perhaps the most annoying of the crowd of skeptics and critics are the neo-feminists who basically dismissed this movie as sexist and misogynistic to women when basically men are depicted basically the same way. Women are hookers, lesbians, and sadomasochists, men are rapists, child molesters, killers, and abuse women. See how it all evens out Ms. L.S. from a certain Entertainment magazine? Well, they're basically wrong, and ignorant in their ways. Childish, ain't I?<br /><br />Rodriguez along with Miller at his side manages to capture the mood perfectly for the book with everything from the comic books adapted on the screen with pin point accuracy, and this comic book fan is pleased. I loved the series, and was satisfied to see Rodriguez stuck true to the source material featuring a world comprised mostly of computer generated effects but manages to accurately capture the mood and dark atmosphere in which the tales take place. The story is set with three segments, all intertwined with one another to make the fluid story of Sin City, all of which is topped off with an amazing all-star cast of actors including Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson, Bruce Willis, the unbelievably hot Jessica Alba, and many other people from Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro right down to the bad-ass Powers Boothe, all of which are mixed in the tale of Sin City; and all of the dramatic operas are about vengeance and revenge, not to mention the great opening, and closer, which was the first time I actually enjoyed seeing Josh Hartnett on screen. I'd have to devote a list to the number of stars who appeared in this film, but it is surely an ensemble piece that even made Jaime King look talented! That's a feat in itself that Rodriguez and Miller accomplish.<br /><br />The entire cast gives excellent performances and a few performances basically stood out for me, especially a certain Mickey Rourke who is just bad ass as the disfigured Marv who is framed for killing the only girl who ever loved him, and then there's Clive Owen and Rosario Dawson whom are just great in their segment. The most dramatic of the segments is left for last starring Bruce Willis as retired cop John Hartigan who nearly kills the senator's son, who happens to be a child killer, and is framed for the crime. The segment includes three good performances from Willis, the unbelievably hot Jessica Alba, and Nick Stahl who plays bad so, so good. I wish he were the villain more often. The movie, which has been compared to ""Pulp Fiction"" (I love the books but that comparison is a bit of a hyperbole, and I'm not even a Tarantino fan), is one of the best comic book movies ever made, simply because it keeps the original quality of the book while losing none of the cache from the stories and never compromises Miller's artistic integrity which Hollywood would have originally done, and Rodriguez as always gives some amazing direction.<br /><br />The storyboards for the film consisted of pages from the actual comic used, and it's like taking scenes from a movie on to a new movie. Miller always prided himself in being a rebel. Having had many bad experiences with Hollywood, he declared that he'd make his books like movies, and the man is brilliant. Read his work on Daredevil, Batman, and this series, and you shall see. You shall see, my friend. Miller is like a movie director who never was. If studio execs, my mortal enemy, hadn't jerked this guy around, he would have made an amazing director, and it took Rodriguez, another Hollywood stalwart to see that. It takes brilliance to notice brilliance, and Rodriguez did much of the movie's work in his own home studio and really managed to pack a wallop of the movie for fans of both comics and noir, and Rodriguez doesn't alienate non-comic book fans, he invites people to bask in the excellence that is Sin City, but he does something some studios have yet to do, he honors the fans in the process. Seriously, I can discuss this movie forever, but I'll spare you the extra reading.<br /><br />Hot chicks, big guns, bad ass bruisers, what more could you ask for? This is neo-noir for the new millennium baby, and one of the best comic book movies ever made that noir fans will also really enjoy. Yes, the line above was clich&eacute;, but I don't care, this movie rocked with excellent performances, great stories, great direction, and just a hip style that hasn't been achieved since ""Pulp Fiction"". This movie kicks Hollywood in the nuts, and I hope they felt that.",Sin City

Carla Gugino and Jaime King get the look of the average film noir femme fatale down, but Alexis Bledel looks like she would have been more at home at an Avril Lavigne concert.

5302006,B004SIPA0A, A39YZF4O904AA5,5.0, evolution of film noir,"I think Miller likes to take things to the next levels and be extreme. In an interview I read he liked the works of Ayn Rand, and her novel the Fountainhead. The character of Howard Roark in the novel is echoed in the villianous Roark characters in Sin City. I think Miller is commenting on free will taken to the extreme and shows the negative side of this in his work of Sin City. Where as Rand is optimistic, Miller is the pessimist. In a world where film noir is taken to the next level, Politics and Religious figures take advantage of their power and commit sexual acts without remorse. (...) Where everyone is pretty much the antihero and where men become caricatures of a film noir hero, our heroes have become bad and the antiheroes have to run wild exacting proper justice. Even the action in the work becomes a little ridiculous because I think Miller is caricaturing the world and shows us that this film noir world is extreme and extreme action must be taken and sometimes this is ridiculous. Miller is showing us the evolution of the film noir and that means, taken to the extreme, being a man means to be brutish lug who slap around helpless females. He is showing their evolution of their negative nature right? But the white light is love in this ying yang relationship in film noir, that is worth fighting for.",Sin City
5302007,B004SIPA0A, A36HBE2C5SQ2E6,5.0, A Masterwork of Cinema. A movie that oozes originality.,"Sin City is based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, who is also the co-director. The movie is split into three stories: Dwight's, Merv's, and Hartigan's. Quentin Taratino is also a guess director.<br /><br />The movie starts off with Hartigan, a ""60 year old cop with a bum ticker"" and he is trying to save a little girl from being raped. He  ends up sacrficing himself for the girl, ""a old man for a young girl"". We cut to Merv's story, when a hooker is dead in his bed, and he has the blame placed on his shoulders, he tries to find the man that killed her, and avenges her. We then cut to Dwight, who is then thrown into the war between the prostitutes and the city police, They are seriously teething on the brink of war, and He must find a way to stop what could be deadly. Then, We are thrown back into Hartigan's story, 8 years later, he is in the same situtation, but the people have changed. He has to stop the Yellow Bastard from raping Nancy again.<br /><br />This movie almost didn't happen because The Director's Guild of America didn't want Robert Rodreqiuz to make this film, so he quit the quild, and worked with Frank Miller on this film, creating a page by page movie that makes you feel that the book had come alive on the movie screen. The acting is at its best, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis do their best acting, since their last best acting, and help shape and mold the movie. This is a prime example of esteemed originality, and hard work. It is a might fine film that can put you on a roller coster ride through the place that is called Sin City.",Sin City

Elijah Woods is super twisted in this movie.<br /><br />The women were as strong as the men, and the men as evil as cold black hell.

5302011,B004SIPA0A, A5FW0TITZL5XV,5.0," Widescreen Only, HA","I am so proud of Robert Rodriguez and Quinten Tarnitino for making sure their movies get widescreen only releases. They want everyone to see the movie the way it was supposed to be seen and not this garbage full screen versions that exist. Other than that, this movie is fantastic and everything a comic book movie should be. You say it is too gory? It is rated R for a reason and if you were to read the comics, they are exactly the same way. Fantastic movie, and if you don't get it because it is widescreen...you are a fool and uneducated about movies. Widescreen should be the only format and everyone else should cry themselves to sleep.",Sin City
5302012,B004SIPA0A, A3NCIN6TNL0MGA,5.0, Assured Style Wins the Day,"Flexing its muscles in every explosive scene, Sin City is comprised of three stories, all centered on similar motif of the hero saving the damsel, in this hyper-realistic, other-worldly film, which I promise, with its intense imagery and in-your-face assured direction, will be unlike any movie journey you've ever taken. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Clive Owen all do terrific jobs as embattled heroes living in a nihilistic, sex-obsessed metropolis where violence rules the day the way it did back in the cowboy era. Indeed, the film has many qualities of a good western. Similar to the western genre, Sin City takes a look, often sardonic, of masculinity, the way it becomes exaggerated in such a world of chaos and danger. Mickey Rourke, with made-up commando chin and hawk nose, is the greatest send-up of hyper-masculinity I've ever seen. The plots, which center on evil officials, sociopathic killers, and damsels in distress, are familiar, but the film miracuously creates a world you've never stepped into before, succeeding grandly in recreating the seedy, imaginary dream-fest of the graphic comic novels written by Frank Miller.<br /><br />There is concern for some viewers about the violence and I am no fan of graphic brutality. While I'll concede that the blood flows freely in this film, the violence is so stylized that even someone like myself could handle it. Finally, let me add that the film has an ironic, campy feel that mitigates the violent impact somewhat.<br /><br />Is the film about anything other than the director's assured style as he captures the gritty world of a graphic comic novel? I say a resounding yes. The film does stand for a certain kind of courage and integrity that survives in a world of corruption, lies, and nihilism. The heroes and victims are at their core tender, soulful archetypes and not just stick figures.<br /><br />I think though that what stand out in the end is the original style, so assured and consistent throughout. This is a landmark film and I would bet that it will pave the way for a new age of graphic novels adapted to film.",Sin City
5302013,B004SIPA0A, A1ZKAHFYCJRGQM,2.0," A Whole Lot of Style, Very Little Substance","Watching ""Sin City"" is kind of like dating a particularly bubble-headed supermodel.<br /><br />Sure she's great to look and the sex may even be fantastic. But sooner or later she's got to do other things besides look great in clothes(or out of them) like, y'know, talk to you.  And if she has nothing to say that's a problem.<br /><br />The problem with ""Sin City"" is that it has absolutely nothing to say though it admittedly looks great doing it.  Upon its theatrical release the film was lauded for it's visually stunning look and on that score at least you can believe the hype.<br /><br />On looks alone, no film since the ""The Matrix"" has carried with it since an incredible ""Wow"" factor.  But ""The Matrix"" also had an engaging, thought-provoking storyline and well developed characters to move that story forward.  It is in these areas that ""Sin City"" falls short.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that the film simply tries to cram too much into two hours.  The movie condenses three separate storylines from Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" graphic novels into one movie.  Big Mistake.<br /><br />Any one of these stories alone would have made for a solid, gripping film.  By trying to tell all three stories in one movie, the film ends up giving these stories and their characters the short shrift.<br /><br />Virtually all the characters, with the possible exception of Mickey Rourke's performance as the hapless boxer Marv, come off as underdeveloped.  Just because a movie's source material is comic books doesn't mean your heroes and heroines should be one dimensional.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez(""Desperado"" ""Spy Kids"") is reportedly such a huge fan of Frank Miller's work that he offered him a co-directing gig on the movie. But in my opinion, the pair should have picked just one of Miller's storylines to focus on.  In fact, its astounding that the notoriously sequel-prone Rodriguez didn't realize that by not doing so he was squandering an opportunity to do two follow-up movies.<br /><br />In closing, I'm left wondering why half the actors in the free world were salivating at the chance to star in this movie.  Perhaps the massive cast saw it as a chance to star in the next groundbreaking genre film, the next ""Blade Runner,"" ""Brazil,"" or ""The Matrix.""<br /><br />If so they lost sight of one key fact.  What makes those movies classics is that they didn't just have style. They also had substance.",Sin City
5302014,B004SIPA0A, A17FLA8HQOFVIG,2.0, All about style and special effects.  But where was the story?,"The film is all about style.  It is a comic book brought to life.<br /><br />At first I was intrigued.  The characters are larger than life and the plot is about the hero trying to find the killer of a woman with whom he spent one romantic night.<br /><br />The film is shot in black and white and uses color to make its point.  Blood is always red.  And so is lipstick.  Eyes are green or blue.  And there really is a yellow bastard.  The acting is good too and the sets complement the film.<br /><br />However, Sin City lacked one important thing - a story I could get my teeth into.  The special effects and style overshadowed everything.  And I was left wondering what all this was about.  I watched this film for over an hour, hoping that it would make some sense.  Finally I fell asleep.<br /><br />Perhaps this film would be interesting to film students.  It certainly is a departure from the norm.  But I need more than experimental techniques to hold my interest.  I need a good story.",Sin City

Blood gushes everywhere as a sadistic murderer is hacked to death and violently dismembered. The screen is equally splattered as other characters take multiple bullet wounds without dying, in true comic book form. The nude scenes are not as graphic, but are cartoonish. Mickey Rourke offers his best performance since ""Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man,"" while Bruce Willis shines in his best movie since ""Hudson Hawk."" The plot, which consists of several interweaving stories, is outlandish, and ultimately the movie doesn't hang together so well.

5302018,B004SIPA0A, A2FS6OGMZMALTD,3.0, Too true an adaption for the movies,"All right, let me say right off the bat I'm not a fan of ""dark"" fiction.  I always find it both silly and a little predictable.  So if you like that dark stuff, go ahead and add a star to this review.  Maybe two.  As for me, it just didn't mesh together well.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED:  Marv, the psychotic maniac with a heart of gold.  His character, indeed his whole first story, made the film for me.  Truly an original character, Marv is struggling with mental illness.  He is ruthless, bereft of compassion for anyone that gets in his way.  At the same time, he's actually a pretty decent guy.  Despite his cruel nature I liked him a lot.<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:  The narration.  I can see it in a comic book, reading it, and even liking it.  But spoken aloud, even by talented actors, it sometimes comes across as cartoonish, even ridiculous.  Lines like ""My Warrior Woman"" just didn't work at all for me.  They even made me chuckle a bit.<br /><br />The stories:  They're not bad, but they're all just simple variations of each other.  Scarred but noble men defending tarnished angels.  Only the first one held my attention all the way through (largely because of Marv).  The others were just weaker versions.<br /><br />The violence:  I know it's supposed to be dark, but the violence in this film doesn't come across as scary and horrifying, but ridiculous and goofy.  A guy gets shot over a dozen times but doesn't die.  Somebody gets hit by a car not once, but twice, and just walks away.  Is this a looney tunes cartoon?<br /><br />The extra ""Dark"" touches:  And of course, there's the over the top stuff that is just plain dumb.  A bad guy not only kills prostitutes, he eats them.  And not only does he eat them, he makes them watch him eat them.  Then he keeps their heads mounted on the wall.  Dark?  Please, that's just goofy.<br /><br />MOST DISAPPOINTING:  Where were the extras?  Normally, I don't care about them on a DVD, but Sin City took a lot of technical muscle to translate onto film.  But there's not a making of doc or anything of the sort.  Just a little promotional film with actors and directors saying how much the respect each other.  Yawn.<br /><br />FINAL THOUGHT:  I have to give Sin City a shrug in the end.  After watching the first story, there's not much point in going on except for some nice visuals.<br /><br />But I really did like Marv.",Sin City
5302019,B004SIPA0A, A3SLETJX0KLHTU,5.0, For the skeptics...,"I wasn't really surprised when I saw that some people rated this movie as 1-star (even the very best cinema has those who rate it low, for whatever reason). However, they often fail to cite reasons why, or the reasons are inexplicable. Anyway, here is why I rated it a five:<br /><br />Visual-Amazing! The way that each frame of the movie is like the frame of a comic book simply draws you into the experience. The black and white nostalgic look with colors that blazed forth from the screen. Nothing short of excellent.<br /><br />Dialogue-While many criticize the dialogue as 'cheesy', you have to remember that this movie is based off of a comic book. It's supposed to be a little cheesy sounding, just like a comic book is.<br /><br />Characters-God how I hated Rourke. How I loved Hartigan. How you grow to love and hate the characters and become a part of their experience is amazing. I hated Rourke so much.....<br /><br />Plot-Taken from Sin City comic books, and those were just....amazing and original.<br /><br />Soundtrack-The music did what it should: provide the boost of emotion (suspense, happiness, etc.) without interfering with the movie.<br /><br />Themes- This is where many fall short. They criticize the movie as being ""for serial killers or psychopaths"" whithout looking at what the movie is really saying. Just because a movie contains cannibals doesn't mean it is endorsing cannibalism. So what themes are in this movie? I'll list a few: 1.Justice-What is justice? Is justice killing a murdurous cannibal, regardless of its legality? Is justice obeying corrupt officials? Is justice mudering a bishop who eats people? The movie points out that justice sometimes goes against traditional ideas of legality and personal morals. 2. The price paid for good- Every person who does good in the movie suffers for it. The movie seems to portray the idea that ""no good deed goes unpunished"". Upon further viewing and analysis, one can find even more themes. And no, I am not reading into it, people write movies-*gasp*-to portray ideas! Godforbid a deeper meaning...<br /><br />Those are my reasons for rating this movie so high. While many complain about violence, objectification of women, ask yourselves, ""Why did Rodriguez put that there?"" And no, the answer is not to be gratuitous.<br /><br />An old man dies.

Because the best way to veiw the film is as a film, not as 4 short films. Yes, it's great to be able to veiw both ways, but, why is the additional footage not in the feature-legnth cut? The extended version is not a complete film, it's each story re-edited to separate short-stories. It's not the same tension or experience as the theatrical cut, which would be improved by the added footage.<br /><br />Now the blu-ray quality is there, the film's AVC @ 22.mbps average, and the DTS MA is nice though I have yet to grasp why DTS MA is 24/48 and not 24/96 (truely thunderous audio!)

5302026,B004SIPA0A, A9TG2NFA614S9,3.0, A Little Too Graphic,"""Sin City"" is a black and white film recreation of Frank Miller's b and w graphic novels with every so often a vivid swath of colored eyes, blood, or some villainous single color. Someone's blue eyes will appear in stark color and thrust themselves at the viewer. The stories are grim, gritty, morose, tough-minded. There's plenty of action, violence, and the scenes are set up to resemble the comic book world, a close approximation of what you would see in a graphic novel. Quentin Tarantino was involved as a guest director so you know what to expect. Computer enhancement was used. Many of the scenes are evocations of the graphic novel drawings--turning the static page into the kinetic world.<br /> There are really three stories melded together, each section with its own hero played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen. The first and third parts come together near the end.<br /> The movie will make you uncomfortable, queasy, squirrely at times with its gritty realism, humorlessness, and starkness. The flick doesn't let up and give you a chance to breathe but keeps on its violent inevitable avenging pace. It's a melodrama gone spastic and ballistic. The avalanche of fateful action goes rolling on and buries the viewer who just hopes to come up for an occasional breath of fresh air. It's a claustrophobic, insular, crushing atmosphere.<br /> We're lucky all movies aren't made at this breakneck pace and with this intensitry, grittiness, and sense of futile inevitability. It's crime and punishment, avenging forces, and anti-heroes fighting against incredible odds. A movie for people with specialized tastes, but a worthy experiment.",Sin City
5302027,B004SIPA0A, A75MSQQ3LN86Z,3.0, Not Quite SNUFF But Worth Watching If You've The Taste,"NOTE:  Look at the Goya prints of the Napoleonic invasion of Spain.<br /><br />Style may not be everything in cinema or in anything else, but it does help to pass the time.  It can keep you glued to your seat, watching a spectacle and even make you glad you spent whatever you spent for it. In  this case its an opportunity to surrender oneself to what may well be the signature movie of the Bush Decade; which is to say, to experiene an essay in sadomasochistic violence, featureing cold, elaborate murders, prolonged and in a sense even ritualized torture and mutilation -- including male castration -- and all delivered in a matter of fact, self-jusifying tone indicative of psychotic depravity.<br /><br />SIN CITY is kept out of the realm of Pasolini's SADO only by the film's near-abstract visual style, for instead of photographing the performers of these rituals naturally, or realistically, the film utilizes the look of the 'adult' comic, by severely restricting color.  By so doing, the movie maintains an atmosphere of fantasy that keeps the enterprize at an acceptable distance from the loathsome; as aceptable a distance as the soft-core sadism of Miller's novels can hope for.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this film is entertaining as simply a series of vivid, masturbatory fantasies of a vividly and purposefully ghastly nature.  It makes for an astringent kind of pornography.<br /><br />The three stories that make up the scenario of this movie are vehicles for three male anti-heroes; these are played by Mickey Rourke, Bruce willis and Clive Owen.  There is nothing even remotely spontaneous about their performances, the controlled nature of the cinematography prevent it.  Nevertheless, their performances are hypnotic.<br /><br />And the stories?  The stories, such as they are, are pathetic fantasies of female brutalization, rape and torture, all slick with the slobber of slavish, narcotized love; or that fixation that passes for love among drunken, impotent men.  All the women -- except for one little girl -- are either prostitutes or dancing sexual exhibitonists like the peerless and endlessly agile Jessica Alba.  Many, oozing treachery, parade the streets and alleys in thrillingly fetishistic costumes.<br /><br />At first glance there's a familiarity to all this: it has somethng of the old American detective stories from Hammet to Spillane.  Rotten doins in back-alley L.A.  But, what's happened here is that the sensibility has shifted.  Thanks to the power and popularity of Japanese Samurai movies and Hong Kong Kung Fu movies, the genre has changed; its has become Asian.  It has become crueler, more intense and utterly fatalistic.  All the characters crouch under a low, jagged ceiling of hopelessness.<br /><br />SIN CITY could well be seen as the story of three rag-tag, out-at-the-elbow Samurai who frequent the same mid-town combo noodle joint, brothel, and tavern where they oggle and salivate over the same generic, interchangeable would-be geishas.  They have no Lord, and therefore, no honor or duty, and in their alcohol-soaked consciousnesses, they become the self-appointed protectors of the sluts they are powerless to satisfy physically or financially.  Depravity is not a result, it is a foregone conclusion.<br /><br />Everything is blood-soaked and takes place in the dark.<br /><br />In a land controlled by a hidden, unapproachable autocrat whose deadly agents are everywhere, whose will and methods are secret, devious and depraved, everything is reduced to a series of block-printed pictures printed cheaply on cheap paper; images of poverty, helplessness, empty commercial sexuality, filth and cold.<br /><br />Other people's pain is an amusement: Torture has become commonplace.<br /><br />SIN CITY.",Sin City

5302033,B004SIPA0A, A37JKM7EFD0DIQ,4.0, Sin City Indeed,"Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, based directly, or as directly an adaptation can possibly be transferred from one medium to another, from Frank Miller's comic series of they same name is disturbing, cruel, unrelentless, and possibly sinful (note: Miller is listed as co-director, but this is at the insistence of Rodriguez).<br /><br />As stated previously, it tells the stories from three Sin Cilty graphic novels.  The two most powerful stories are adaptations from ""That Yellow Bastard"" and ""The Hard Goodbye.""  That Yellow Bastard is seperated into two seperate sections, the begining and the end (well sort of) starring Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba.  Bruce Willis is great, but his voice over narration is a technical mis-step and is the only flaw in the story.  The pitcure is so powerful, the voice over overly impacts the visuals.  Willis is believable as Hartigan and he is the last  good cop in a corrupt city - Sin City.  Alba is perfect as Nancy, the little girl who becomes a stripper (the only role I have appreciated Alba as an actress).  The little girl who plays the young Nancy is splendid.  The plot deals with evil at its wose, taking it to its very extremes.  Good finally previals, but with a price.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke gives the best performance since ""Angel Heart.""  He is perfect for the part and  plays it well. This time, the voice over narration adds to the visuals and technically works - enhancing the story and its visuals.  The villians, played by Rutger Haur and Elijah Wood is devilish and scary.  They also show extreme evil, as a man of the cloth perverts what is good for the pleasure of evil transcendence.  The supporting characyters are great, and Rodriguez provides moments to lighten things aup a bit - although quick, it is needed.<br /><br />The story involving Clive Owen should have been left out of this pitcure and maybe added for a sequal, if shown at all. It fails to impact the way the other stories do.  I did not find much wrong with it, it just seemed long and unnecessary.<br /><br />This movie deals with sin, in the extreme fashions, but that may be what is needed to shoke a world out of its slumber.  There is no relativism here - evil is evil - the pitcures tell the story.  And in a world of evil, glimpes of love and hope do survive.  The one good cop and little girl who keeps her promise.  His death is not a suicide but a sacrifice.  A monster showed attention by a beautiful women, and after avenging her, is shown love by the sister.  Redemption is there for the seeking.",Sin City
5302034,B004SIPA0A, A3VFNLPJ24MCQ3,5.0, Hot damn! Rosario Dawson is hot! The movie was really good too!,"This movie was really good. I am not familiar with the comic book this is based on, but I will need to acquiant myself with it, due to this movie.<br /><br />Sin City had a really good, original and exciting storyline, the direction was good, the acting was fine, and the casting was really good. Perfect. Did I mention Rosario Dawson is/was hot? Sin City is a dark film, hawking back to the days of Film Noir. All the characters were on the wrong side of the tracks, just some more so then others. The movie was also very violent, but that is to be expected I guess.<br /><br />I would have to say that I haven't been this impressed with a movies originallity and style, since Pulp Fiction. By the way, one thing to mention. This movie reminds me a little of a book I just read, called ""Blue Goblins"", which dealt with an apocalytic future, sex, drugs, violence, and gangs; it was a good book if you like this type of material.<br /><br />So, to close you have a good,exciting, original styled dark-themed movie; with an excellant cast (with a hot Rosaio Dawson), good direction, and good story. I would strongly recommend this movie!",Sin City
5302035,B004SIPA0A, AKELS44ECAVEB,4.0," Never Seen A Movie Quite Like This,.........One Of The Most Stylish Film I've Ever Seen !!!!!","It is hard to explain in words what kind of film,...... ""Sin City"" is !!! I could probably best explain it like this,... it has the outline of ""Pulp Fiction"", the style of ""The Matrix"", the darkness and gritty feel of the ""Spawn"" comic series; with a bit of a horror feel like ""Friday the 13th"", and the Jason and Freddy films during some parts. With bit of a ""Punisher"" feel as well, if you take a look in the movie. It also has the whole innovative comic like feel of ""Hell Boy"". Let me tell you if you saw the ""Kill Bill"" films; and thought that they weren't bizzare or violent enough. Chances are I probably just confused you and/or gave you a headache, but if you watch the film you'll see what I mean by all that.<br /><br /> The film is based on Frank Miller's creation of the original ""Sin City"" graphic novels; with help from great directors(Tarantino, Rodriguez). Before, I watched the film I didn't real know what to aspect or hope for until, well I started watching the movie. I love the CGI animation, and the whole comic book feel. I never would of guessed that they were going to make a movie like ""Pulp Fiction"". If you never seen ""Pulp Fiction"", the set up is like this. You get multiple stories from different characters, and throughout the movie they will show how each of their different stories or points of view coincide into each other to form a circle which is called a story.In this film you'll hear the main tales of the old cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a rogue named Dwight (Clive Owen), and a big tough guy named Marv (Mickey Rourke); living in Basin city which is ran by a crooked gangster like major leaving the city in his dark shadow. I think that the black and white look makes it fell like an old gangster film; with a bit of imangination. There are many other charcters as well like Jessica Alba, Brittney Murphy, Eliah Wood, Devon Aoki, and some others.<br /><br /> Hartigan(Willis) is an old cop on the verge of retriment; with some heart issues. He is up in years, but still as tough as ever. Hartigan is out on one last job, he must save a little girl from a mad rapist, who turns out to be the major's son. The major is crooked and of course has many connections; and would make his life a living hell if he attempts to save her. So he has a choice, save the girl and throw away the rest of his life or he can walk away!!! Hartigan can't just leave that poor little girl in the hands of a maniac, so he confronts him in a fierce battle. In the end he does save the girl; and manages to wound the major's son, but then he himself is shot up pretty badly and he thinks to himself ""An old man dies a little girl lives.... fair trade."" then the film fades into the next story.<br /><br /> Marv(Rourke) is a tough guy; with a rough past is out for vengenace after Goldie(a hooker) is murdered. He wants answers, and is willing to kill his way to find answers. Marv is more like character like the ""Punisher"" a dark hero. Marv is obviously the most rememberable character. He doesn't seem to be afraid of anything; he in fact is able to take out 13 or 14 cops single handedly; thats what I mean by Matrix style. He even takes Eliah Wood's character a psho cannibal boy and manages to cut all his limbs off and feeds it to a wolf; which kind of tells you that this is no Pg 13 Marvel super hero film, and you probably already got the idea by the title of the film; and believe me nudity galore. This film is very dark and gritty with a ganster feel.<br /><br /> Then you get to Dwight's tale (Owen) who is plainly a rogue. Who is pissed off at some guy who has been getting a little too clos to his girl(Murphy). He teaches him a bit of a lesson, but not sastified. He goes after him, and chases him into the other side of town, which is ruled by a bunch of wild Amazon like hookers; with assault weapons,.... boy oh boy. Well, they end up taking care of the guy; but he turns out to be an under cover cop. This act would indeed cause a war between the Hookers and cops led by the dark (King Pin like character) in a civil war. THat's pretty much where the creativity part comes in. He must destroy the edvidence, but on the way he runs into a lot of trouble. He must face rouge mercenaries, and must spill blood with his Amazon friends.<br /><br /> Hartigan(Willis) is far from done yet though, he finds himself in jail being framed for the crime; he though refuses to testify, and keeps recieving letters from the little girl who keeps her idenity secret. He eventually gives in, after a bluff and he stops recieving letters from her. After 7 years he's back and he is able to track down her who has really grown up and turns out to be (Jessica Alba); he must save her from the mysterious looking man who turns out to be the major's son once again. Basically, Hartigan is the hero like redemption story and must finish what he started years ago.<br /><br /> The world of Basin city is very complex and explict ""Sin City"" is very, stylish and entertaining film. ""Sin City"" though is a little darker for some people's tastes so you'll either absolutely love the film or absolutely hate the movie. THis film is awesome; it's just amazing to me that they were able to combind 3 graphic novels into an awesome combo such as this. 2 hours of fun. Yet, it's no ""Pulp Fiction"" by any means, and very different that anybody that saw the movie expected it to be.<br /><br /> Overall I will give this film a 4/5, a great film with loads of style. ""Two Thumbs Up!!!""<br /><br />Acting: 5/5 I loved all the characters but especially Rourke's character, that character was pretty much made for him and heck Willis is an expert at playing the role of a cop; just see the Die Hard films.<br /><br />Presentation: 5/5! Loved the comic book style, with the Matrix/ Pulp Fiction feel. Like I said nothing quite like this not by a long shot. Absolutely loved the black and white gangster/underground feel as well!!! Kudos to (Tarantino, Rodriguez) and the creator Frank Miller.<br /><br />Showtime Value: 4/5 Great film!!! Very, fun to watch and is great buy for comic book fans or people who like action and violence and such. The film though is rated r fo a reason and may be to dark for some people. There were no bonus features as well. The film itself is a great buy for the right people.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5<br /><br />-Rogue Fox ""Rogue""",Sin City

5302037,B004SIPA0A, AVI158V7UOB2B,5.0, Sin Never Looked So Good!!,"With any kind of movie, no matter how good the story is, it is essentially the quality of the cast which will make or break it, and in my humble opinion, the fascinating characters of Sin City couldn't have been cast any better.<br /><br />Rich and unforgettable characters such as Hulk-like Marv, brought to gritty life by Mickey Rourke, or Jackie-boy carried by the intense Benicio Del Toro perfectly conveyed the dark, sinister mood that kept me riveted.<br /><br />A huge surprise for me, was the part of Kevin, the cannibal, played by Elijah Wood. Sure, it surprised me that he was cast for the role at all, but more astonishing was that he played the part so convincingly. An actor that I until recently found difficult not to associate with a gay halfling named Frodo Baggins had broken free of that mold with simply an eerie, whackjob facial expression and a welcome muteness that lasted the entirety of the film.<br /><br />Indisputably the most eye-catching and gratifying scenes of the film were captured by the ladies. Oh yes, the ladies! Violent and ruthless, yet beautiful and seductive they were. 'Deadly little Miho', a slicomatic in the guise of an innocent cutie and insatiable 'valkyrie', Gail, the boss of whores, were just a few of the most captivating vixens to never leave my mind.<br /><br />'Not so little anymore' Nancy Callahan was simply mouth-watering to look at, and one hardly cared what came our of her mouth so long as the camera never left her. Alba, who fortunately did not have to rely wholly on her meager acting abilities (and with her looks may never have to), was in my mind most notable for her lusty bar scene.<br /><br />Lastly, it should be an indisputable fact that noone could have made a lesbian cop look as painfully sexy and alluring as Carla Gugino, who, from a purely libido-stimulating perspective, surely had the most worthwhile scene of the movie, and should, as far as I'm concerned, never have to put clothes on again... ever.<br /><br />To summarize, Sin City was a superb example of what the combination of great casting and a wonderfully dirty imagination are capable of producing. Thanks so much Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, and I am in eager anticipation of more sin to come.",Sin City

Whether you like Roberto Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino or whether you don't, this film raises the bar for comic book and comic book concept movies for the future. From this movie on, there are only two credible, if widely divergent, paths to take in bringing a comic book concept to the screen: ""Spiderman 2"", or ""Sin City"". One can make a movie as earnestly, beautifully real, full of genuine human feeling, and as lovingly put on screen as ""literal truth"" as ""Spiderman 2"", or one can make a movie as stunningly surreal and hyperbolically drawn as ""Sin City"", but most other attempts will seem poor pretenders. Not to belittle the critic's darling ""American Splendor"", but that small comic gem, quirky and unique, will truly seem like a quaint anachronism after ""Frank Miller's Sin City"".

Rosario Dawson in black leather looks truly a marvelous creature to feast your eyes on.  The Blonde chicks who plays the silent killer is awesome.

As a fan who has read all three of those stories many, many times, I simply felt that the proper titles should have been given, since the editorial review, and another review mixed up the titles.  Marv was in ""Sin City"", Hartigan was in ""That Yellow Bastard"" and Dwight was from ""The Big, Fat Kill"".  Unfortunately, this was not a direct translation, and as always, the books are far better.  I look forward to the director's cut to see if some of my favorite lines that were absent make it in.

Also, I must mention the absolutely brilliant narration. It introduces the characters and their situation very well, and served as a raw opener for each character. Miller has proved his worth writing the original comics, and does so yet again directing this movie. Rodriguez does another fine film, and receives (quite frankly, deserves) respect for sticking to the comics so well. Taratino again proves his curious love for blood in movies. For anyone who hasn't seen it, this movie is three stories. One is that of Marv, a man who falls deeply in love with a woman, only to see her killed on the same night. He goes off in search of the killer, murdering himself on the way. Then there's that of Hartigan, who only has one thing in life that matters, and that's the safety of skinny little Nancy Callahan. He's got to keep her safe; that's all that matters. Dwight, the 2nd to last story in the film, gets to witness the fall of the truce between Whoreland and Copville (those aren't the actual names, but that's pretty much what they are.) The order of these stories are - 1\2 of Hartigan, Marv, Dwight, & other 1\2 of Hartigan. Before I leave off, I'll give you a warning. This movie is incredibly violent, and if you're easily phased by blood and gore, stay away. (For example - a guy gets an axe in the head, another guy gets a swistka-shaped bladeon his eyebrow, another guy gets all four of his limbs cut off, etc., etc...)

Miller was very cautious as to whether or not he wanted to bring his comic to the big screen (he had been burned by Hollywood before with ""Robocop 2""). But, it was full steam ahead when Rodriguez brought a CGI animatic of what the film might look like to Miller (the same CGI presentation was used to also lure Bruce Willis to jumping on board)<br /><br />""Sin City"" is much in the same way & inspiration as that of ""Pulp Fiction"" (Quentin Tarantino directs one small scene in the film. A minor debt he owed to Rodriguez, since Rodriguez supplied Tarantino the score to both editions of ""Kill Bill"" for one dollar). If you like ""Fiction"" you'll love ""Sin"".<br /><br />""Sin City"" consists of four stories that are taken a little out of context.<br /><br />The first two stories bookend the film. The first story has to do with a sociopath (Josh Hartnett), with ""Sin City"" segueing into its 2nd story about a cop (Bruce Willis) on his last day on the job, before retiring, trying to catch a child molester he's been after, called The Bastard. The cop gets in over his head when he finds out that The Bastard has family in high places.<br /><br />The 3rd story has a former boxer turned nutcase, by the name of Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is looking for the killer who killed off his favorite & only prostitute, Angel, & getting framed for the whole thing.<br /><br />The final story has a brutal cop and his buddies getting killed by a group of prostitutes, in Prostitute Row, a section of Sin City that is ruled by its prostitutes. The only rule is, is that cops can not be killed for any reason at all. Oops. The leader of Prostitute Row (a scantily clad, Rosario Dawson) & her boyfriend (Clive Owen) try to cover up the whole mess before the authorities arrive. They don't stand a chance.<br /><br />Sin City is shot entirely in green screen & on a soundstage no bigger than a warehouse. The handcuff fight sequence between Marv & the young psycho kid were shot seperately. Mickey Rourke & Elijah Wood never met each other until the films L.A. premiere!<br /><br />The look of the film is jawdropping. It looks exactly like the comic book, panel by panel (for those not in the know, the comic book is in black & white with some elements in color. I.e., a character says he drives a red Cadilac, you will see him drive a red Cadilac, but everything else on the page is B&W). At times I felt as if I was watching the comic book come to life. And it does.<br /><br />""Sin City"" came out in theatres in early April '05 and will most likely be hitting DVD in late July or August, with everything including Marv's bandages thrown in.

5302054,B004SIPA0A, A2VIBW6JFZ10MQ,3.0, See it once then forget it,"First, let me say that Sin City is the type of movie I normally love to watch---a gritty crime drama that doesn't shy away from realistic language, violence and adult situations in order to create a dark, moody atmosphere.  Second, let me add that I like everyone involved with this film.  I think most of the actors are great, I like just about everything Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino have ever done, and I admire Frank Miller's writing.<br /><br />The bad news, then?  This movie just wasn't very good.<br /><br />The main draw of the film is that it's made to look like a comic book come to life, and in that sense it's a success; the visuals are darkly stunning, and the whole film is, overall, ""cool"" to watch, for want of a better word.  Unfortunately, though, this film is mainly nothing but cliches and tired old story lines about crooked cops, hookers with a heart of gold and rugged detectives that we've seen a million times.  The dialogue is laughably bad and the actors seem stiff and wooden delivering it; you almost feel like you're watching your local middle school putting on a dramatic adaptation of some 1940s black-and-white gangster movie.<br /><br />The movie also goes way, way, way over the top with the violence.  I can watch just about anything and not be bothered, but this film was basically a two-hour barrage of heads being chopped off, men being shot (or stabbed) in the crotch, and other men being turned into swiss cheese by bullets.  When you can't go more than five minutes without showing a bloody killing, you know you've run out of ideas as a filmmaker.<br /><br />Overall, this is the type of movie that 12-year-old boys would see and go ""Wow!  Neat!"", but they're the last people in the world who should watch a film like this.  My advice to everyone else is to watch it once, admire the movie's innovative style, overlook all of its flaws, then forget about it.",Sin City
5302055,B004SIPA0A, A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,3.0," Primitive, stylish, derivative - detached from all humanity","Visually stunning and stylistically arresting, Sin City is ultimately a big ultra-violent and overwrought mess that's inventive and engaging for the first thirty minutes but rapidly becomes rather tedious and dull. Sin City is also a half-hour too long, brutal, and relentlessly juvenile; and it also sends some strange messages about the kind of violence that one is expected to endure on screen. It's hard to know whom the target audience is for this cinematic piece of pulp - it's certainly not women, the director, Robert Rodriguez certainly makes it obvious how he feels about them, and it's far too graphic for younger teens.<br /><br />The action takes place in a kind of monochromatic, noir black and white universe, with the occasional splash of colour, mostly blood red. In the opening scenes Josh Hartnett appears as a handsome, debonair hit man who approaches a beautiful blond babe. Everything is in cartoonish black and white, except her iconic red dress and blood red lips. They are on a balcony of a penthouse overlooking the crime-ridden hellhole of Basin City. After he quietly shoots the woman, the viewer is transported into three separate tales, each layered over the other, where morally ambiguous heroes take revenge on the scum that fester in mean streets of the City.<br /><br />In the first story, a craggy and weather-beaten Mickey Rourke, unrecognizable under lots of makeup, plays Marv, a brutish street fighter with the ability to dish out and take tremendous punishment (in the form of numerous bullets) and also leap off tall buildings without getting hurt. When Goldie (Jaime King) Marv's beautiful blond hooker is killed, he goes on a rampage to avenge her, which involves beatings, shootings, and various assorted decapitations. In the second story, Clive Owen, complete with foppish hair, is Dwight, a churlish yet polished private investigator trying to protect Old Town's sexily costumed bondage-like hookers, including statuesque ex-girlfriend Gail (Rosario Dawson), after they mistakenly kill a cop (Benicio del Toro). Ironically, the prostitutes turn out to need less protection than Dwight.<br /><br />Both these segments are book ended by washed up sixty-year-old cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis). His last hours of service involve saving an imperiled child from a rapist/killer (Nick Stahl) who is the son of a U.S. senator. He stops the serial killer, castrating him with a shot from his cannon-sized revolver, but the child soon comes back to haunt him eight years later as a stripper (Jessica Alba). She longs to go to bed with him, but at the same time, the hideously deformed killer, has now turned into a foul smelling inhuman beast and is still after her.<br /><br />There are lots of big name actors in peripheral roles including Brittany Murphy as a plucky, disaffected blond waitress and Elijah Wood as a murderous cannibal who eats one victim's surgically removed hand in front of her and mounts his other female victims' heads on his wall. There's the promise of child molestation, cannibalism, electrocution, and copious amounts of severed limbs. None of this is at all particularly offensive as it's heavily stylized and edited, but there's something sinister about a scene where the good guy can get shot in the chest ten times and still live to fight another day. Is the message that bullets will hurt but not kill?<br /><br />There's also something disturbing about a movie that unsophisticatedly portrays women as sexual objects in the form of glamorous whores, and as victims of violence - mere cannibalistic trophies with their severed heads hung on a wall. Sin City's moral dilemmas are bogus and engage no emotional response, and with the corpses gradually piling up, the movie ends up having no sense of fun beyond the filmmakers' twisted self-indulgence.

5302056,B004SIPA0A, A1W3FS1C2H4RCV,3.0, Looks aren't everything,"I have never read Frank Miller's Sin City comics.  I was only vaguely aware of them when I saw the ad for the film.  I just thought that the imagery in the commercial was striking and so I went to a matinee.<br /><br />I have read in other reviews that the movie is more of a recreation than an adaptation of Miller's comics.  Now, as I have stated, I don't have any first hand knowledge of this particular comic, but I have seen enough comics to know that this is the most faithful and evocative depiction of the comic strip form that I have ever seen on film.  Visually, Sin City is stunning.  It is a comic strip come to life.  The only thing is, this comic is dull.  Not just dull, but dumb.<br /><br />Miller may have a gift for drawing, but he is no story teller and his prose is heavy-handed.  Sin City is Film Noir because it deals with hard boiled guys and urban settings and violence and underworld themes but it seems to have more in common with low-budget sleaze than with The Maltese Falcon or The Big Sleep.  Actually, I really like some low-budget sleaze and as a big-budget ""low-budget sleaze"" film, this movie is great.  All the men are old and surly.  All the women are barely clothed and are either innocent virgins or callous whores.  The bad guys are really bad and hold all the chips.  The good guy is washed up and cynical and has nothing to lose.  The violence is great,  Thank goodness for the violence.  It's all over the top (think comic book) and fun and there isn't much squirm factor.<br /><br />This review turned out much more negative than I had planned.  I enjoyed Sin City.  I just had to get used to the idea of absolutely no intelligence and then I settled in and enjoyed the spectacle.  Style can go an awfully long way and Sin City is dripping with it.",Sin City

What he meant was that the window dressing - clothes, cars, music, setting - was more important than the stories.<br /><br />Today this phenomenon is so familiar that we frequently confuse veneer with content, especially in cases where there is no content - read Paris Hilton among others. In Sin City you find the full flower of this evolution.<br /><br />Rodriguez has taken the two-dimensional comic images of Frank Miller, (in combination with the one-dimensional characters and plots), and succeeded in making them even more two-dimensional. The film is visually mesmerizing, a spellbinding combination of heavily made-up actors, digital backgrounds, and high-tech special effects. It has the flatness of a comic, and like a comic, it is impenetrable.<br /><br />So compelling is the visual style achieved here that you quickly forget that the plots are moronic, the characters both ludicrous and repulsive, the reliance on exhausted stereotypes pitiful, and the entire vibe simultaneously decadent and corrupt on one hand, on the other self-satisfied and smug.<br /><br />Sin City is a place where everyone is guilty, every day is dark, and every problem is solved through violence. Rodriguez and Tarantino are still the two bad 12-year olds who must be separated because they are disruptive to the rest of the class.<br /><br />If you want to see another example of what happens when these two miscreants collaborate, check out From Dusk Till Dawn, a film which certainly has earned a place on any Worst Movies Of All Time list.",Sin City

I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can't stand graphic violence. I myself may never watch it again, although it is a most brilliant piece of work. I'd dub it a cult classic upon release.",Sin City

5302062,B004SIPA0A, A2TLZM2Y3581HU,3.0, Children's film,"Robert Rodriguez make good children movies.  Sin City is not very different from Spy Kids in intelectual delights or graphic innovation.  The violence (that is only strong for American viewers  that don't watch world cinema or, let's say, news) is relentless and a little pointless (I mean, there is no use to it, no interesting commentary about it, it simply exists).  The CGI backgrounds are well used this time (vs. the well-received and far-from-good ""Sky Captain..."") but some of the shots (for example, when travelling in cars) are so stilized that take from the possible force of situations all the tension: in a fantasy world, the world of videogames and C-movies Rodriguez and Tarantino grew in, you never die even when you do and so there's no danger.  The non-linear screenplay ala ""Pulp Fiction"" also takes out of the film its share of interest, and so we are left with the esthetics and the gorgeous girls (and maybe that was the intention of the auteur).  I don't know if the film is going to survive the relentless advancement of technological eye candy (that makes fx made for fx wonderment some years ago look like, ahem, garbage) but the undoubtful interest of Rodriguez in his material and the efforts put in the realization makes this film at least a candidate to top the comic adaptation sub-genre for many years to come.",Sin City

But it doesn't mean that this movie was perfect!,"thanks to Frank Miller, Author of original Sin City Graphic novels who have directed this movie too, Ciertaily it's one of the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen. I'm not a cinema guy cause I can't watch a movie from beginning till the end without delay and I used to play back some scenes to watch them again and if I couldn't, It would sure made me rattle and nervous. but this movie is different. I just coudn't stop it even to use restroom! It was great, the only problem I noticed was the boold. In some scenes it was white, in some it was silver and in another some it was yellow and that made blood scenes less impressive. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, they should've shown the bood in black, not any other colors. and another problem of the movie was the Junior, at the end. they colored him and his stuff in yellow. that was inducing that the Junior is an alien not a human. but he was a maniac human and this movie was not star wars or star trek. we expected to see living dead & Unvulnarable Superhumans but not an alien like creature. and the third problem is not this movie's problem in particular! It's the next sequel's problem and the problem is, they'd gathered all suitable stars in this movie. Bruce willis, mickey rourke, Benecio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba and more but most of them died in the movie. so there is not much stars left for the sequel I hope they make it as soon as possible. Cast selection for this movie was extremely accurate and I'm afraid for the next sequel if they'll not do their job as good as this one. and at last it's not bad to mention that this movie was a big credit for Rodriguez after making some horrible movies like Spy Kids trilogy and I hope he continue to making movie with his original talent that we've previously seen in Desperado (1995).",Sin City
5302065,B004SIPA0A, A3Q80Q6YFP5W6Q,4.0, black and white with a splash of bloody colour,"Ah, the joys of having a theater right across the street.  Tonight, after work, we decided to check out Sin City, as we've been wanting to see it for quite a while.  So, on opening night of the new theater, we tromped on over, gave them our pre-paid passes and sat down in the theater.  After numerous commercials and numerous trailers (boo to the commercials!), the first scene came on.  A little over two hours later, we came out of the theater entertained, though slightly disappointed by the whole thing.<br /><br />Sin City is based on a series of graphic novels by Frank Miller, and it looks like it.  As numerous articles have stated, the movie looks like it took panels straight out of the comics.  Three storylines are used, beginning with Bruce Willis trying to track down a child molester on his last day on the job.  We then get Mickey Rourke playing Marv, a disfigured man who finally finds a woman who is nice to him, getting framed for the murder of a prostitute.  Finally, Clive Owen gets involved with the wrong woman, which could bring the end of the truce between the prostitutes that run Old Town and the police.  We then go back to Willis' story to finish the film, as the girl he saved is all grown up and carrying a torch for him, even as others are after her.<br /><br />Sin City is told in a noir style, with voice-overs throughout the entire movie.  It became slightly weird when some of Owen's voice-overs actually came directly out of his mouth, but then again this is in a scene where he's talking to a dead guy (and the dead guy is talking back), so perhaps it's excusable.  Some of the dialogue in these voice-overs (as well as dialogue between the characters) is overdone, sounding wooden and relying on the actors to make it even remotely believable.  A lot of Mickey Rourke's dialogue is like this, and he's not as successful in making it palatable as Owen is.  Other dialogue, however, fits the style perfectly, and while it's not Shakespeare, it's not meant to be.  The successful lines are those that the actors take just this side of serious, but still have some fun with it.<br /><br />Sadly, Brittany Murphy is not one who can do that.  Her acting is horrible in this movie, her breathy delivery of the noir dialogue reinforcing how corny it really is.  She tries really hard to be the femme fatale, but she fails miserably.  She has one long scene with Owen and Benicio Del Toro, and they both run her over with their talent.  When she finally leaves the screen, I breathed a sigh of relief.  It helps that Owen's segment was the best of the three and he gets to interact with Rosario Dawson and the rest of the prostitutes.  I was quickly able to forget Murphy and move on.  Jessica Alba as Nancy, the grown-up version of the girl Willis rescues, is ok but not wonderful.  Thankfully, that applies to most of the rest, too.<br /><br />Standouts do include Owen and Del Toro (who has some hilarious scenes after a certain event happens), Willis doing a good job of playing the ""hard as nails with a heart of gold"" role that he often plays, and Michael Madsen as Willis' partner.  Madsen has one of the toughest jobs, as his dialogue is some of the worst, but he does a good job overcoming it.  Maybe he's used to bad dialogue by now, given the movies he's been in.  Rosario Dawson also does a good job with what she has, though her final scene is a bit overplayed.<br /><br />The violence is quite graphic, with red blood being enhanced by the black and white photography.  Even when you don't see the bullet enter the head, you often see the blood splatter on the person doing the killing.  If violence makes you squeamish, this is not the movie for you.  For some reason, the movie seems to have a crotch fetish, as quite a few characters are shot or otherwise stabbed in the nether regions.  This all was quite shocking at first (and I was *ready* for the violence, so it's not like it was a surprise), but I quickly got used to it.  Mickey Rourke's story is probably the most violent, as there are close gunshots, blood flying from punches, beheadings, cannibalism, and an axe being applied to almost every part of the human body.  Once that story is over, it's toned down a bit.  Of course, that's like saying a category 4 hurricane is toned down from a category 5, so don't get the wrong impression.<br /><br />Is the movie good?  Is it worth seeing?  I can tell you that I enjoyed it.  The violence is very stylized and well-choreographed.  The stories are interesting and the characters, while often over the top, are still engaging.  The acting fits the story for the most part, with the exception of Murphy.  Some of the characters weave through the various storylines, making cameos in the ones that don't directly involve them and giving the movie something to tie all of the stories together.  I liked how Willis' story framed the other two, giving us both the beginning and end of the movie.<br /><br />Finally, I didn't mind the grimness.  And this movie *is* grim.  Not only is it violent, but don't expect the usual ending to any of the stories.  A lot of people who like violent movies go to enjoy the mindless action, thinking ""ooooooo cool explosions"" and letting it wash over them.  It can be a fun way to watch some brainless eye candy.  Don't go to this film expecting the same.  It is not fun.  There are a few funny moments, some witticisms by some of the characters, but this isn't your normal action movie.  It can bring you down if you're not careful.  Still, if you like this sort of thing, Sin City is a wonderful example of the genre.",Sin City

The movie runs just over 2 hours and I never once felt the need to catch a glance at my watch.  Robert Rodriguez did an amazing job with bringing this one completely together.  The only downside to the movie was the cleche 50's dialogue.  But it fits the piece well and you become accustom to the language in no time.  This work of art is definately worth seeing.

5302079,B004SIPA0A, A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,3.0, generally effective comic book film,"***1/2<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez' ""Sin City"" is a highly stylized adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who, along with Quentin Tarentino, assisted Rodriguez in the directing).  The film draws its look and inspiration from those old film noir movies from the 1940's, the ones set in dark, rain-soaked, crime-infested cities and narrated in florid fashion by a world-weary private investigator or gumshoe.  ""Sin City"" has that in spades along with deliberately arch dialogue, self-conscious acting and a visual schemata designed to knock your eyes out.<br /><br />""Sin City"" tells the episodic tale of three virtually unrelated ""super heroes"" (played by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke) who take on crime and corruption in what is, as the title implies, a veritable metropolitan den of vice and iniquity.  The three leads are supplemented by Rosario Dawson, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer in various smaller roles.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is far more about style than it is about substance, and, indeed, the story is the least engaging aspect of the film, often becoming repetitious and aimless and devoid of cohesion and unity.  The look of the film, however, is what keeps us interested.  Filmed primarily in black-and-white, the movie adds splotches of color at key moments and for various thematic purposes and relies heavily on rear screen projection to give it just that right post-modern/retro look it needs to be effective.  As in the ""Kill Bill"" movies, the violence in the film is graphic but so highly stylized that we never take any of it very seriously, although there may be just a tad too much dismemberment for some people's taste - though, strangely, the people who are killed never seem to stay dead for very long in this movie.  The art direction is less sensational than it is in many of these comic book movies, but the streamlined simplicity of the look keeps it from overwhelming the film.<br /><br />The child molestation theme that runs through the movie may be off-putting to some and it does result in a few queasy moments later on in the film.

5302083,B004SIPA0A, A1QVARU29455D0,5.0," Gritty, violent...but beautiful.","Frank Miller does not like women.  I'm firmly convinced of this, as every woman here (and most if not all in his comic book epic this is based on) is either a stipper, prostitute, or college professor.<br /><br />And the college professor died before the movie starts.<br /><br />Despite this, there are no real weak female roles.  While they all have less than respectable professions, they are all strong, unique characters, and I think that pretty much lets Frank off the hook.<br /><br />In a more general sense, this movie is about a film noir kind of town.  Guns are everywhere, blood and death abound.  Howeveer, the visual style of it all is so compelling that it looks remarkably similar to the comic opus.  Strong uses of black and white keep everything graphic, but not gory.<br /><br />The movie is actually about 3 character's tales, that intertwine on a very superficial level.

5302084,B004SIPA0A, A35PQZRJDYQT8H,5.0, Even More Spectacular Than The Original,"Admittedly, this was my favorite film of the year in its original form.<br /><br />The Special Edition was worth the wait, and in my opinion, is worth buying even if you purchased the original.<br /><br />The second disc includes the film in a new version -- as three separate graphic novels (and one graphic short story) --fully capturing Frank Miller's incredible vision in glorious black and white (and red and yellow).  In a word, amazing.  I almost always find director's cuts to be a tiresome affair -- simply re-inserting scenes that were correctly cut the first time.  Not so.  Not one frame feels like filler.  Everything serves to deepen and enrich the amazing world of Basin City.<br /><br />I haven't made it through all of the new extras yet (on the second disc), but two are definitely worth noting.  The 15 minute Flic School (a staple of Rodriguez's special editions) is great and focuses on the process of shooting in the digital domain -- one surprise was learning that many of the actors who work together seamlessly in the film never actually met in person.  Ahh the magic of digital editing.<br /><br />The companion piece to the flic school is an all greenscreen version of the theatrical release.  That is -- Rodriguez takes only the raw footage of the film, without any special effects, de-colorization and in many cases, sets -- and speeds the whole thing up so you get to race through the film and see how they did it -- which sets were real, which ones weren't, etc.<br /><br />Truly incredible.<br /><br />This one gets my vote for DVD release of the year.",Sin City
5302085,B004SIPA0A, A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3,5.0, It is a good sign when the book author LOVES the movie!,"Miller was more than reluctant to see his novels (in comic book form) get made for the screen. After all, he'd worked long and hard to get his own series so why hand over the reins to someone else? Word is, he resisted tons of offers until finally he was convinced by a very persistent director, who went so far as to film a trial scene, complete with the ACTUAL ACTORS to be used in the movie. That did the trick.<br /><br />Okay, so that is a fine backstory but what about the film itself? Does it live up to expectations?<br /> Yes, and more so...just don't be surprised by the graphic nature of the film. Those familiar with Miller's work won't be - it is those who aren't who may have to make a few adjustments in their expectations, although I think they'll be entranced from the opening scenes.<br />  The plot is pretty much as you'd expect from a movie based on a Miller book. Murder, revenge, love, lust and corrumption everywhere. The world so gritty that you feel like showering after you leave the theatre, convinced the dust and grime are so thick that they HAVE to had escaped the screen.

However I have to say, I'm getting a little tired of these bare bones DVD's that come out months before the big Uncut Unrated Extended Deluxe Never Before Seen Director's Cut Version is released. Why can't they just release the good version and the barebones version at the same time? Give people an option, and give them a break while they're at it?",Sin City

5302088,B004SIPA0A, AKB2PYODH0TKS,4.0," Farewell my Ugly, terrible way to part and endship","Exchange the name Velma for Goldie and you'll find yourself looking for Robert Mitchum, Moose Malloy and a lot of easy woman and tough guys.  This is a movie, of four crime stories adapted from Frank Miller's popular comics. It focuses around a muscular brute (Marv played amazingly smooth by Micky Rourke) who's looking for the person responsible for the death of his beloved Goldie.  Marv's fed up with Sin City's corrupt law enforcement, so he takes the law into his own hands.  In his past he has made a horrible mistake killing a cop who risks his life to protect a girl from a deformed pedophile, and a hitman looking to make a little cash.<br /><br />But the story itself is just the icing on the cake and something to wrap around a the days garbage.  The real reason to watch this movie, besides all the great looking woman who some how manage to look just as tough as the men (while walking around naked) is the STYLE.  The constant flow from black and white to partial color (almost always red for blood) and the almost cartoonish mayhem, are what make this a GREAT movie.  Somehow the movie never seems too over the top (ok sometimes it's hanging on Occam's razor) or the acting to be too broad to be campy. It's just great fun to watch all these actors enjoying themselves and playing it staight for laughs.",Sin City
5302089,B004SIPA0A, A13DQTXG02HZC1,4.0, Captivating,"After watching this movie, I look forward to get myself the extended version.  For enthusiasts, they would have already known that Sin City is based upon comics done by Frank Miller and from excerpt provided in behind the scene, Frank himself didn't believe a movie need to be made as it's perfect as it is.  However, Robert Rodriquez had an idea that he couldn't resist.  Rather than conforming the comic to the movie format, he opts to turn it the other way around, made a movie that looked like a comic.  This movie is a testament of why I love movie at the first place.  It's an escapism, away from reality and for those two hours watching it, I literally was brought into the world of Sin City and totally captivated by all those characters (mainly strong men that had soft spots for fallen girls and who would be their protectors or their minders, to undo the wrongs or to make things right).  It's a movie that ought to be seen to be believed.  It's that good!  It would be one of those movies that would sit on well with Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill I and II.  Highly recommended.  This edition is thin on extras, only a behind the scene which is brief by any standard.  Get the extended one if you may.",Sin City

Hollywood producers haven't caught on that moviegoers are not pawns who will run out and see every Ashton Kutcher formulic comedy or some forgettable horror film. As a college student I can safely say this is the biggest cult movie to come around since Fight Club. Cinematically gorgeous in a way that a 200 million dollar Lucas epic could never imagine. Maverick acting by Rourke and Willis, who apparently refuse to become washed up. Perfectly directed and ""chopped""- there is never a dull scene. Overall, a five star film that through all of the excess manages to evoke real human feeling.

We follow three storylines. My favorite was the one starring Mickey Rourke as Marv. He was brilliant in this movie and handed in one of his best performances. Lots of big names in this movie including Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Nick Stahl, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood, Michael Madsen, Josh Harnett, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jessica Alba, Jamie King, Rosario Dawson, Carla Gugino, and Brittany Murphy.

5302097,B004SIPA0A, A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,3.0, Different,"Ok so I already wrote a review for this, a pretty long one at that and for some reason it never showed up so I'm writing another one.  I wanted to say that this movie, although not AMAZING as some would think, was actually really really good for what it was.  I walked into this movie with different expectations, not to say that my expectations were better, just different.  I've never read the comics and maybe thats why it was so weird for me, but it stayed true to comic style in writing and camera shot.  Because of the comic style dialog it comes across quite corny.  That aside, you have to look at this film with different eyes.  Your not watching a film, your watching art.  And I might say, Rodriguez paints one amazing picture.  The imagry, the omage to Miller, the tribute to the comic was really amazing.  As I said, I've never read the comics, but after seeing the movie I picked up a few at the bookstore and flipped through, and I might have to say that Rodriguez did Miller proud.  The plot is full of twists and turns, small subplots that interwine together all involving strippers, hookers, canibals and pedophiles.  The first story revolves around Marv whos been set up by canibals to take the fall for the murder of a hooker.  He sets out to find her killer and ends up taking the rap for it in the end.  The second revolves around (Clive Owen) who is defending his girlfreind from her abusive x and starts a war between the hookers and the cops.  The last revolves around Hartigan (Bruce Willis)who in the opening saves a girl from being raped by a pedophile and is shot (what apears like to death) but we see is really hospitalized.  Things happen and 8 years pass and he now has the chance to save the now grown up stripper (played by Jessica Alba) from the pedophile again.  The plot is really moot compaired to the briliant way the film is shot.  The violence is brutal and relentless, but since 90% is done in black and white it really isn't as graphic as it could be and for all you horny men out there who are vying to see Jessica Alba naked...she doesn't!  The film is really a hodgepodge of scenes and to be quite frank after walking out it took me a while to rememeber what happened to whom.  Don't go for the acting, don't go for the story, go for Roberts art...and you'll be happy you did.",Sin City

I saw the trailer in Scoresse's Aviator and about wept tears of joy at it. The film begins just a tiny bit slow(and Madsen's acting is HORRIBLE) but it's been about a month since I saw it and cannot stop talkking about it. After I saw it I immediality ordered two posters form it. It's film where you fall in love with a character more than the whole story behind it. Deffinalty a good flick.",Sin City
5302099,B004SIPA0A, A1PQQPGFI8NC48,3.0, Apathy City,"After a long delay, I finally have seen Sin City.  The film is undeniably a visual masterpiece.  The movie looks unlike anything I have ever seen.  I will preface the rest of the review this, I am not familiar with Frank Miller's stories.  I cannot imagine that the movie watcher has to have any familiarity with the content, but I have not.  I usually love movies like this, like Pulp Fiction.  However, I just could not get into this movie at all.<br /><br />I was not put off by the non-ending violence, but what is the point?  The characters are stale and there is not one person in the movie worthy of emotional investment.  The movie plays like a visually stunning gore filled yawn.  After the two hours were over I did not care one way or the other about the characters.

5302101,B004SIPA0A, A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,5.0," Incredibly cinematography, and Jessica Alba at her hottest","Sin City is a collection of semi-connected scenes for various people in a wild city.  Prostitution, pedophilia, murder, and corruption, it's just like Detroit.  Aside from the plot, the cinematography is stunning.  It's trendy, mostly black-and-white, with emphasis on specific colors to draw attention to ideas or concepts that enhance or benefit the movie.  Whether it's the blue eyes of an ""innocent"" prostitute, the yellow deformities of a killer, or the kaliedescope of colors indicating confusion and tension, the vivid colors are the tip of an amazingly represented film.<br /><br />The movie starts with the murder of a young woman.  At first it seems pointless, but it's simply a buildup for the chaos to come.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays a detective trying to save a young girl from the grips of an evil pedophiliac.  Unfortunately for Willis, the villain has family connections and an appetite for murder.  It's up to Willis to stop the crime, and save a young child, and evidently, satisfy his urge for genital mutilation.<br /><br />The obvious star of the film is, Merv, the character played by Mickey Roarke.  He's a beast that has hideous facial scars.  He gets his dream woman, his Goldie, who ""smells like angles ought'ta smell"".  Goldie gets insidiously murdered, and it soon becomes time for Merv to start his streak of revenge.  What follows is a collection humorous, albeit unbelievable, scenes that lead to the true murderer.  Heads in the toilet, torsos used as emergency brakes, faces sent several feet deep into concrete, and axes to the groin, it's only the beginning of the carnage.  Once the cannibalization and nudity starts, the movie really gets into the ""plot"".<br /><br />Hot women!  Tons of murder and blood!  Religion!  More nut-sack mutilation!<br /><br />Eventually the movie leads to ""Old Town"", a place where prostitution is rampant - replete with the gratuitous semi-nudity - and the girls dish out their own version of justice.  It's where the entire movie ties in together, and all the scenes slightly relate.  A distorted sense of good's triumph over evil serves as a conclusion to the movie, as an absolute slaughter takes place and ""order"" is preserved.",Sin City
5302102,B004SIPA0A, A2DL4A745ETNOT,5.0, I LOVED IT!!!,"I loved this movie a lot. It was bit scary, very violents, sad, depressing, and utterly funny. Even though each character in the story has very little screen time. The characters(to me at least) that have the most screen time are Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Rosario Dawson. They have very important roles in the movie. There screen time are in different segments of the movie and all these different events are happening over a period of 1 night. There is a cannibal in this movie played by Elijah Wood and he eats people. Its really scary and the violence is so bloody even though the movie is only in Black, White, Yellow, red it shows some skin tone to Jessica Albas character at the bar. Many of the other characters including Alba dont have much screen time. But Jessica Alba just ties the whole movie together. Its very interesting and a little bit bizarre. But my favorite part of the movie is the segment ""Big Fat Kill"" its where Clive Owens character is very angry by the way Jackie Boy is treating his new girlfriend Shellie. He wants to get rid of him Shellie his very abused by him but she takes it. He finally says he is going to kill him but as he jumps 5 stories out of the apartment building she screams stop but she was really screaming cop. Jackie Boy wants to attack a hooker so he chooses Becky(Alexis Bledel) then soon all the hookers gang up on him and finally kill him but then they dont realize that Jackie Boy was a cop and when a cop gets killed other cops join in and get rid of all the hookers. They want to stay calm So all the hookers decide to go home Becky goes and she is actually telling her mother whom she loves dearly that she isnt a hooker and she is always talking to her on the phone every night just to hear her voice but not this time she goes and tells the police department what happened. Gail gets really angry and then Dwight(Clive Owen) comes to save the day. Finally the whole entire police is dead Becky gets shot in the shoulder but she doesnt die she hides in an alley to escape all the gun shots and finally the big fat kill is over. That was my favorite Segement. Their are other segements involve other characters. This does have some confusing parts but it is indeed a very good story. At the end Becky gets out of the hospital with a sling and a bandage over her neck because gail bit her there. Shes still talking to her mother when a doctor who is actually a hit man is in the elevator with her and nobody else. Suddenly he says Becky do you want a smoke and she gets really scared and shocked then she says a dramatic I love you to her mom and she knows that will be her last conversation with her mom. the audience assumes that either Gail or Dwight hired him to go and kill Becky. It can be really confusing but i loved it anyways.",Sin City

There HAS to be more.<br /><br />Now I'm not a tree-huggin', peace-marching, free-lover, but if you want to see part of what's wrong with our culture of violence, check out this film.

5302105,B004SIPA0A, A3DR6R79WUCQHP,5.0, A BIG FAT THRILL!,"Finally, after 13 years of waiting, Frank Miller's homage to the hard-boiled pulp novels he enjoyed as a youth have come to life on the big screen in the respectful hands of Robert Rodriguez.  Sin City won't be for everyone because like many films, they won't know what they will be seeing.  So far, friends of mine who have never read a Mickey Spillane novel or watched a Bogart film think the dialogue's too fast, the dialogue's too over the top and the actors were over acting.  This film was made in the film noir style of the 30's and 40's but by using modern technology they have tranformed it into a magical world that only exists in the pages of Frank Miller's graphic novels.  If you understand the pallet that Miller and Rodriguez used to make this film, then you might just appreciate it for the masterpiece that it is.<br /><br />Frank Miller started out in comics back in the late 70s, first making his landmark with his famous run on Marvel's ""Daredevil"" series in the early 80s where he created one of the most beloved female assassins of all-time...Elektra.  After this, he moved over to DC where they gave him the opportunity to do anything he wanted which produced his first self-titled graphic novel, ""Ronin"" the story of a samurai from ancient Japan teleported into the future.  Then came the big one, DC gave Miller the reigns to the character that first inspired him to get into the business...Batman!  Frank Miller produced ""THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS"", the story of an old Batman who has given up.  Bruce Wayne has been retired from crime fighting for ten years but a swarm of gangs and violent crime in a Reaganomics Gotham City causes the Dark Knight to return and show these punks that you don't mess with Gotham!  But this time, the police aren't so willing to accept the vigilante actions of old Bats.<br /><br />Moving on, The Dark Knight Returns brought Miller a lot of publicity which led him to Hollywood to write the two Robocop sequels.  But he soon learned that being a screenwriter is the worst job to have in Tinsletown.  His scripts were cut up and flipped around so badly that he lost all hop of ever doing movies again.  So Miller returned to comic book land and decided to draw what he wanted to draw.  Taking his love of Dashiel Hammet, Raymond Chandler and Mickey Spillane novels, Miller created Sin City.  There would be tough guys, sexy women and classic cars.  The books are like a Spillane novel on steroids...as hard-boiled as you can get.  Filled with constant violence, nudity and hard dialogue.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez first became famous for making El Miriachi in 1991 for no budget and really shot into superstardom with his follow up, ""Desperado"".  After a few other films that included ""Four Rooms"", ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", ""Roadracers"", ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" and the 3 ""Spy Kids"" movies, Rodriguez started to persue a work of passion.  A massive fan of Sin City, Rodriguez literally stalked and hunted Frank Miller and begged him for the rights to make the movie.  Miller had been so disillusioned from his past experiences in Hollywood that there was no way he was giving up his baby unless he could direct it.  Rodriguez went out and got Josh Hartnett and another up and coming actor to film a test to show Miller what kind of film he was going to be making out of Sin City.  He filmed the three page short story ""THe Customer is Always Right"" which is the opening of the released film.  Miller loved it, and agreed to let Rodriguez direct the film but only if he could co-direct it.  Rodriguez agreed to this, but he was kicked out of the Directors Guild for doing so.<br /><br />Rodriguez decided to translate three of Miller's graphic novels to the film to give the world a good idea of what Sin City was.  The first story is ""The Hard Goodbye"".  The story revolves around a modern day barbarian of a loser named Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is seduced by a beautiful hooker named Goldie (Jamie King) to protect her from an unknown serial killer (Elijiah Wood) who has killed five of her friends.  After a night of amazing sex, Marv wakes up next to Goldie who is dead.  He's been framed, and he will go on a violent path of vengeance to find the people responsible for killing the only woman who was ever nice to him.  The second story is ""The Big Fat Kill"".  The story follows Dwight(Clive Owen), a man who is wanted for killing his wife.  While sleeping with his current girlfriend Shelley (Brittany Murphy), they are interupted by her ex-boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benecio Del Toro) who is banging on the door with four of his drunk buddies.  Dwight wants to take them all down but Shellie pleads with him that it would be trouble.  Jackie Boy and his friends leave for Old Town, a section of Sin City where the hookers and the police have a truce.  The cops stay out, and the girls get to enforce their own laws and punishment. Fearing Jackie and the boys might hurt someone or maybe even kill someone, Dwight follows them into Old Town to warn his old flame Gail (Rosario Dawson) of their drunken states...only to find the girls are already waiting for them to make a mistake.  A mistake that will threaten the way things go down in Sin City and especially Old Town.<br /><br />The third story is ""That Yellow Bastard"".  John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is one of the best cops on the Sin City force but due to his angina he is forced into early retirment...but there's one case he isn't walking away from.  A child rapist/murderer (Nick Stahl) has kidnapped an 11 year old girl named Nancy and Hartigan is going to take this scum out even if it kills him.<br /><br />But the killer is the son of a power Senator (Powers Boothe) and the corrupt cops are protecting him...including Hartigan's own partner Bob (Michael Madsen).  Nothing will stop Hartigan from saving the little girl, even multiple gun wounds.  After blowing the killer's hand and genetalia away, Hartigan is gunned down by Bob but saves Nancy.  He is blamed for the kidnapping of Nancy and the murders of the other girls and is sent to prison for 8 years.  The little girl he saved, Nancy, sends him letters every week...but two weeks go by without any letters and when he finally gets one, there's a severed finger inside.  Fearing they may have gotten to her, Hartigan gives in and confesses to the murders to get a release so that he can save the now nineteen year old Nancy (Jessica ALba) from the mysterious Yellow Bastard that keeps following him.<br /><br />The movie is the most accurate and loyal adaptation of a comic book ever made.  It is literally word for word, shot for shot, Miller's graphic novels.  Filmed on green screens, the backgrounds were all animated giving the film a magical look, almost as if we are not in a real world.  The technique we first saw in ""Sky Captain and the World Of Tomorrow"".  At one point, I felt like I was watching the opening of The Wizard Of Oz during the tornado.  The cast is almost too perfect for the roles they play.  Mickey Rourke gives the best performance of his career.  Bruce Willis is more than perfect for the role of Hartigan, and Elijiah Wood delivers a frightening performance as Kevin the cannibalistic serial killer.<br /><br />Look for the scene directed by Quentin Tarantino between Benecio Del Toro and Clive Owen.  Rodriguez and Tarantino first met on the film festival circuit in 91 while they were showing their first films El Miriachi and Reservoir Dogs.  The two became good friends and even collaborated on two films, From Dusk Till Dawn and Foor Rooms.  Tarantino directing a scene for Sin City started back on Kill Bill Vol. 2 when Rodriguez agreed to score the film for $1.  In return, Tarantino directed a scene for Sin City for $1.<br /><br />Sin City is a film that really breaks new ground.  It is just as beautiful as it is ugly.  The violence is constant and brutal at times but easy to handle due to the comic bookish technique used by the director.  The nudity from the books was toned down.  There's really only one word to describe Sin City, ""COOL.""  It's probably one of the coolest films since Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"".  Like Pulp Fiction, some people have been confused by the films order.  You have to remember that these storylines sometimes take place at different times, so it won't be strange to see characters from other stories make an appearance in another story, even if they're dead...kinda like John Travolta in Pulp coming back at the end of the film.  Lord knows how many times I had to explain to people that the end of the film happens before Travolta is killed by Butch.  I've gone on long enough...Sin City is a tribute to the work of Frank Miller and in my opinion it's taken too damn long.  Frank Miller is one of the best comic book writers of all time and Sin City is as hard and as tough as they come.  It was worth the 13 year wait!",Sin City

I actually found the Sin City comics passable, but inferior to Miller's previous works. The film however is nothing more than pointless frames filling the gap between literal translations of panels from the books.there is no creativity or vision at work, just 126 mins of static images in motion for no reason. I see people pointing out instances of allegory and symbolism in defense of this embarassment, but these translate to little more than a desperate attempt to put tinsel on a turd. I could go on but this film has cost me $8 and two hours of my life. Learn from my poor judgement and don't bother.",Sin City
5302107,B004SIPA0A, ABUQ780GW5ELG,5.0, Best film of the year,"Sin City is the best film of 2005 (with the exception maybe of 'Star Wars Episode III'). Rodriguez, Miller, and Tarantino do a fantastic job of bringing a visual masterpiece to film. The movie behaves as though you're watching the graphic novel (which I think was the point). Bruce Willis leads an all-star cast as a cop with a bum ticker and ready to retire. Mickey Rourke does the best job in the film as the vicious animal Marv, who is out to avenge the death of a hooker he barely knows. The film is split into four main stories. The first is the story of a man (Josh Hartnett) who courts young women, then kills them.  The second is Hartigan's story (Willis), where he is after a kidnapper and murder of young girls. Then we have Marv's story, which deals with a creepy and sadistic Elijah Wood. The final story is 'A Dame to Kill For,' where Dwight (Clive Owen) must try to stop a creep (Benicio Del Toro) from hurting the local group of hookers with his gang. This one is the third best story. The Marv story is the best, then Hartigan's then Dwight's, then the Man's story (which is the shortest). They pretty much all interact with each other as well, even though they are each stand alone stories. There is lots and lots and lots of violence, and plenty of nudity (especially on the part of Carla Gugino, ""Spy Kids""). Definitely get this one!",Sin City

Unfortunately, a movie should do more than just look great. The throwaway dialogue and cliche self-destructive characters coupled with the non-stop over the top violence, seems to have no point, other than to overload us with bullets and blood, not to mention enough view of skin, to keep teenage boys busy for awhile.

5302117,B004SIPA0A, AGEIT17HENDIS,5.0, Out In The  2000s Crime Noir Night,"No question I am a film noir, especially a crime film noir, aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various &lt;em>crime noir&lt;/em> efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that ""speak"" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been better left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy and need no additional comment from me as their plot lines stand on their own merits. Others, because they have a fetching, or wicked, for that matter, &lt;em>femme fatale&lt;/em> to muddy the waters also get a pass. Of course when I think of noir it is 1940s-50s noir, black and white in film and in the good guys-bad guys constellation with a little murder and mayhem mixed in to keep one's eyes open just in case there is no &lt;em>femme fatale &lt;/em>to muddy the waters. Neo-noir, such as the film under review, Sin City, is another matter, perhaps. Here's the why of the perhaps.<br /><br />Central to the old time &lt;em>crime noir&lt;/em> was the notion that crime did not pay and as stated above the bad guy(s) learned that lesson the hard way after a little mussing up or a date with a bullet. Kids' stuff really when compared to the over-the-top action of this three vignettes series on modern day good guys versus bad guys. Three separate male characters, all tough guys and guys you would want to have at your back if real trouble headed your way, are trying, trying within the parameters of common sense or believability, to clean up slices of Sin City. Sin City as the rather obvious name implies, is in the grips of corruption from the top down, including in virtually every civic institution. Our avengers are trying to cut a wedge into that bad karma by individually, one, tracking down a bizarre, politically connected heir whose thing was slice and dice of very young girls, two, avenge the death of a high class call girl who was kind to one tough guy, and, three, keep the pimps and cops at bay in the red light district where the working girls have set up their own Hookers' Commune.<br /><br />All of this doing good is, of necessity in today's movie world, linked up with, frankly, over the top use of violence of all sorts from cannibalism to barbaric death sentences, well beyond what tame old time noir warranted. Apparently the succeeding crime waves since the 1940s have upped the ante and something like total war is required to exterminate the villains. That and some very up-to-date use of cinematography to give a gritty black and white feel to the adventures. And also a not small dose of magical realism, suspension of disbelief, and sparseness of language to go along with the plot and visual action.<br /><br />But here is the funny thing, funny for an old-time crime noir aficionado, I really liked this film. Why? Well go back to the old time crime noir premise. Good guys (and then it was mostly guys- here some very wicked ""dames"" join in and I know I would not want to cross them, no way) pushed their weight around or tilted at windmills for cheap dough or maybe a little kiss. They got mussed, up, trussed up, busted up in the cause of some individual justice drive that drove the ""better angels of their natures."" Guess what, sixty years later, a thousand years advanced cinematically, a million years advanced socially (maybe) and these guys are still chasing windmills. Nice, right.",Sin City

Being in High School at the time of it's release it seemed every ""popular"" kid loved this movie. I mean maybe I have a bias, but it's just I didn't think it was that good. It's long, it jumps storylines with little connection and it overall is too ambitious for it's own good. I mean I love movies of similar sorts such as Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, but this movie just was a bit too much for me. I think it's worth renting (although it's on Starz and HBO now to my knowledge) and I will see the second, it's just not as good as people make it out to be. Will most people actually like this movie? I doubt it. Great cast, great director, not so great story line = OK movie.",Sin City
5302119,B004SIPA0A, A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,4.0, Interesting Action...,"While the new Robert Rodriguez film, Frank Miller's Sin City, is not a horror movie, it isn't not a horror movie. (Yep, I got A's in English.) One of the coolest things about this tres cool movie is, you can't pigeonhole it. Punching, kicking and slashing its way through every genre imaginable - chiefly film noir, comic, mystery, action, drama, romance, and thriller - Sin City has more severed heads, dismemberments and cannibalism themes than The Silence of the Lambs and Freddy Vs. Jason put together. I loved it!<br /><br />It is based on author/illustrator Miller's series of graphic novels of the same name. The plotlines include elements from the stories The Babe Wore Red, The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard, and more. Like the phantasmagoric storybooks, the lush yet stark look of the movie is achieved by using satiny black and white enhanced with splashes of color. Early buzz has Miller's fans thinking that only Miller fans will glom onto the cinematic Sin City. Not so - I'd never read or even saw one of his books in my life before viewing this dark delight, yet I was on board from start to finish. It's only April 1, but I can easily say that Sin City is undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />A metropolis bled morally dry, Basin City is the site of three torrid tales that follow several larger than life characters through their lives and, for some of them, their deaths. Each one is a man on a mission that takes him down a rabbit hole to an urban nightmare of seedy alleys, strip clubs, into cheap motel rooms, and around winding back roads to rescue, defend, or avenge a woman.<br /><br />Hartigan (Bruce Willis) is a no-nonsense cop who, after saving a little girl (Makenzie Vega) from a brutal child-rapist named Junior (Nick Stahl), is punished for his good deed and spends the next ten years in a solitary prison cell. Once released, Hartigan has cause to thank heaven for the little girl who's grown up in the most delightful way: Nancy (Jessica Alba) is now a lasso-swinging exotic dancer who's fallen deeply in love with him. But Hartigan and Nancy's troubles start all over again when Junior reemerges (now as a Max Schreck/Nosferatu styled creep called Yellow Bastard).<br /><br />Marv (Mickey Rourke) has a churlish countenance, but at his center is a heart of Goldie - Goldie (Jaime King) being the pulchritudinous prostitute who was murdered after their one glorious night together. Marv makes it his quest to hunt down and kill her killer. This is the flagship story, and it's wonderfully infused with Rourke's pervading presence (though they might should have lightened up on the prosthetics a tad; he doesn't look like a real person).<br /><br />Another story in the anthology follows Dwight (Clive Owen), a red Converse-wearing, trench-coated Weegee'esque newspaper photographer who has a hand in committing a most unfortunate murder and then must go to great lengths (and depths!) to cover it up.<br /><br />While the anthology ostensibly follows its male residents, Sin City would be dull indeed without its firecracker female characters. Following film noir and classic detective novel convention, the women are kicked as often as they're kissed - but they give as good as they get. Dangerous dames line the city's highrise rooftops like beautiful but deadly gargoyles, protecting their turf from all comers. Tough cookies, hookers, strippers, and cocktail waitresses abound, as do Kill Bill styled assassins (Devon Aoki's ""Miho"" would give Chiaki Kuriyama's ""Gogo"" a real run for her blood money), barely-clad lesbians, and the female trophies of a literal head-hunter. Miho's pimp is played with fishnet panache by Rosario Dawson.<br /><br />The Big Sleep wakes up in a hi-def, CGI world with glorious results, akin to film noir on acid. Rodriguez famously chronicled bootstrap moviemaking methodology in his book, Rebel Without A Crew; while he certainly had a lot of help with Sin City (Miller co-directs and cameos as a priest, while Quentin Tarantino also helms a short, gruesomely comic passage), you can definitely see his stamp here. You can hear it, too - as per usual, he composed most of the score himself. Even with his cinematography, Rodriguez faithfully reproduces the chiaroscuro palette of Miller's novels. The screenplay (also credited to Mr. R... does this guy do the catering, too?) tempers the characters' cynicism with believable flashes of hope and sentiment.<br /><br />Dialogue and 40s pulp noir voiceovers are punctuated with clich&eacute;s and gallows humor even as explosive, stylized violence unfolds onscreen. The cast of dozens all nosh the scenery, even when they don't have a word to say - the mute, lethal and utterly vile villain, Kevin (Elijah Wood), is a character you won't soon forget. Smaller roles with Rutger Hauer, Carla Gugino, and Powers Boothe are also sure to resonate with audiences.<br /><br />A famous line from a classic noir film matter-of-factly says, ""There are eight million stories in the naked city. This has been one of them."" Sin City has at least three, but here's hoping for more in the future.",Sin City

There is enough crappy movies out there, that it's not worth your 8-10 dollars a person to see.<br /><br />Everything Quintin touches, seems to be worth seeing. This movie is unlike anything you've seen so far. It's pretty wild how it really looks like a black and white comic book, but yet the characters are real. You have to see it for yourself, but you don't have to be a comic book fan to like this film, you have to be a movie fan.

I'm gonna be honest, this movie has fight scenes that are even more exaggerated than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, a movie which this one reminded me off cause the karate chick in old town can fly. Basically all of the 'good' characters can withstand enough punishment to kill an entire infantry division worth of troops.

5302124,B004SIPA0A, A1RHBDGMYEH2Z0,2.0, The Sins are in the details,"Sin City is a interesting failure in that it portrays a stunning grim and grimey metropolis, but populates it with supermen and women who are as out of place there as Clark Kent is in Batman's suit.  Even Hartigan (Bruce Willis), the most vulnerable character whose heart condition that acts up at the most inopportune times, can survive a myriad of bullets and still live to tell the tale.  I even might have looked away from these points if the stories made up for them.  Well, they don't.  There is no mystery in them; they just blame some sort of authority power whether it's government, police, religion, etc, for all the problems the characters are having at the time.<br /><br />Okey dokey, how about the characters; they have to be sympathetic and interesting, don't they?  Marv (Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan are the best and deserve better stories.  Dwight (Clive Owen) is a typical tough guy character who isn't given as much to chew on as the other two except for perhaps Rosario Dawson's lips.  Why, though, is he given the power to jump pretty high off the side of a building to chase after Jack (Benicio Del Toro)?  Because if he didn't, he wouldn't have missed the key bit of information that Shellie (Brittany Murphy) was going to tell him about Jack.  Did she say ""stop"" or something important I needed to know?  Oh well, off to whoretown!  That's just lazy storytelling and gives off the clue that there really isn't a very good story being told in the first place.<br /><br />The visuals though are completely brilliant, and it's probably worth the price of admission just to see them.  Even though I've only seen samples of his work online, I can see Miller is a wonderful artist, and his visual work translates wonderfully on the big screen.  There's tribute here to all the great film noirs of the 30's, 40's, and early 50's, and I'm sure Rodriguez and Miller screened several of them to the crew for inspiration.  It's a pity though that this one isn't that good.<br /><br />2.5/5",Sin City

However Sin City should<br /><br />have been at least 30 minutes shorter as Rodriguez needs to use his brilliant trick with the violence for 3 story lines.

Nothing I have seen in life compares in originality or daring to Sin City.  I can rarely say I honestly laughed my A** OFF watching a movie but this one I honestly died laughing more times than the people in this DVD.<br /><br />I could tell you what it was about but why ruin the movie for you.  This is just a plain and simple must buy movie.  I honestly did not think it would be too good so I waited before I watched it.  It has snowed overnight and I have no where important to go so I popped Sin City in the player to see how bad aweful gets.<br /><br />I was laughing my head off within a few minutes after the movie started.  When a dude offed a lady with the carefree abandon it takes to flick off a light switch as they stood on a rooftop after having professed his dearest undying devoted love for her, I knew this was my kind of movie.<br /><br />This movie is in all ways weird.  First its not exactly color and not exactly black and white.  Its not exactly film as you would know it and not exactly animation.  This DVD is a maddening mix of video game, animation, old 30's era black and white film noir type movie all with a sick twisted hint of absolute genius threaded throughout the story.  This movie finally was populated with my kind of people everyone was so weird so off the wall.  The good guys were either deranged souls or sinfully kinky and the bad guys were perfectly evil.<br /><br />There were wolves in this picture being themselves and you know I had to love that!!!!  This movie was so far over the top that it just defies words.  Thing is as far out as this movie is it does not play too far off reality if people let their real weird sides out.  I suspect if ever came a day where everyone was forced to take their mask of polite society manners off what you see in this movie would reign in our world for that unguarded time.  This movie effectively looks under and investigates every sick twisted kinky thing that crawked out the rock garden humanity jealously steers prying eyes away from.  This movie effectively lays some of polite societies best kept secrets bare for the whole world to see and the results are an endlessly torrent of laughs.<br /><br />The movie is so good you can't just watch it once.  To be truly enjoyed this movie must be watched a mininum of three times.  The people who made this movie need to make another one.  This is way too good to be left a one off.  This movie made me laugh so much my face hurts.  The cost of this Sin City DVD is some of the best money I have ever spent on AMAZON.com DVD's and I have brought a bunch of DVD's in my years as an AMAZON.COM customer.  You can't beat Sin City walking or riding trust me if you have the money this is a no brainer you must buy this just don't wait to see it play the minute it arrives at your home.<br /><br />This movie is not for the kiddies as it is blood, butt, breast and gore fest.  Sin City is definitely adult entertainment but trust me this will leave grown up faces hurting from having laughed so much.  Please enjoy this movie as I sure as heck did.  Sin City is my kind of Towne it was a pleasure to visit its odd ball inhabitants and I will come back often...  Thanks to those who made this movie possible.<br /><br />My only question?

If you could take the graphic novel into the theater with you, you could read along. There are shots straight out of the book on the screen.<br />  It helps to be a fan of Frank Miller's work when you go see this movie. The movie has some great scenes and dialogue. Marv steals the movie, IMHO. Most of the movie is in black and white (as the comic). This is a beautiful movie to watch. It has a little Pulp Fiction feel to it as the stories intertwine (also, Bruce Willis is in the movie).<br />  The stories in the movie are all very gritty, violent and dark, mostly about people driven by revenge. A woman killed, a cop set up and jailed...not very hard to follow but made interesting by the way they tie together. All the acting here is well done and Frank Miller makes a cameo as a preist.

5302132,B004SIPA0A, A3MA7SDWD1HJE5,1.0, Trying Too Hard,"I saw this film in the theater and hated it. It came off like a teenage boy trying hard to write a Tarantino script. Everything the two bumbling henchmen said struck me like the guy who wrote it was writing it just so people would have something to quote from the movie.<br /><br />The multiple dismemberment or castration scenes were just pointless and ridiculous. When someone has their genitals pulled off and it bores you, you know there's something wrong. It seemed like the point was to be shocking and cutting edge, but like I said, they missed the mark here and I was really just tired of it by the time the ninja prostitute showed up.<br /><br />I will say that I really liked the cinematography. The look of the movie was great, and that was the part (going into it) that I thought I'd like the least, but it ended up working very well. I would have rather seen them only use color at certain times or for highlighting important things to the audience, instead of just randomly giving a guy red shoes, but I guess that's ok<br /><br />I thought the camera angles, the way the shots were framed, all that was needlessly repetative (6 or 7 shots with a thonged woman's butt in the left foreground, and the person talking in the right background, for instance), but no more so than the actual script, so maybe that's not something anyone else cares about",Sin City

Happy it's here, but mad they double dipped! Oh well!",Sin City
5302134,B004SIPA0A, A3W13VVBRY5GL7,2.0, Not good,"The first and most important element of any decent Sci-Fi/Action movie is a good script with strong characterisation, plausible dialogue and a believable motivation behind the lead characters. Without these, the film invariably descends into a campy parody of itself, and that is precisely what's happened here.<br /><br />It doesn't matter how closely this movie sticks to the comics that spawned it - when you move to a different medium you need to make changes to reflect the move (like the cut-down character backgrounds in the X-Men movies, or the plot tweaking and omission in the Harry Potter series - two extremely successful sci-fi/literary adaptation franchises), and sadly, 'Sin City' seems to think it can get away with having the actors spout the same kinds of dialogue as they do in the comics.<br /><br />This doesn't work for several reasons. On the printed page, we need to have things spelled out for us that comic art - particularly the kind of comic art contained in the Sin City books, a hugely graphical and stylised look - can't capture. Character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - all of these are things that comics more often than not need to have as printed text, and in the comic book medium, this works. On film, these things - character subtleties, plot development, emotional states - are all possible to achieve with visuals - facial expressions, body language, montage sequences, and so forth. The movie of 'Sin City' has its first major failing, then, in that the characters - grim and gritty men and women of action and consequence - wax lyrical over themselves, their current situations, and their previous histories - until they end up sounding like pedantic Drama majors about to embark on their first audition. The Valkyrie speech? The White Light line? The entire opening monologue? Three of the most horrendous offenders that are so full of their own self-importance that it makes the rest of the script surrounding them pale into mundanity - which isn't too much of a problem since it was all pretty mundane to begin with.<br /><br />The second problem with 'Sin City' is the amateurish use of spot colours, here and there, to suggest a tie to the excellent style of the comic books. 'Schindler's List' used this ploy to great effect, but sadly, here it just looks overdone. Not that this is a bad idea in theory, but thanks to some pedestrian direction (particularly in the first and second stories) it seems to be there just for the sake of it, as opposed to highlighting anything actually important. Case in point: the blue eyes of the young hooker in the second plot are just annoying because there aren't enough worthwhile close-ups of her face to make the colour stand out. It becomes a mere annoyance noticing these small splashes of colour against, it must be said, an overall rather effective visual style of high-contrast black and white areas.<br /><br />Direction is run-of-the-mill action fare.<br /><br />Performances are forced and difficult, particularly the action movie veterans like Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke. It can't be much fun having to deal with such clunky dialogue as this. They do their best but sadly, as is the case with the more traditionally artistic actors like Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro, fail to deliver the mawkish, over-the-top lines with anything other than palpable disbelief.<br /><br />Two stars for a brave attempt is all I can award this movie, such a potential wasted and with such a horrible, forced script, it's lucky to get even that. Pick up the comics instead, they're far more rewarding and not half as annoying.",Sin City

5302144,B004SIPA0A, A2VGCL2TL8GZR9,3.0, Not your ordinary exploitation film,"Parts of this film were brilliant, other parts rancid. It's got one of the sharpest looks I've seen in a film in some time. Based on a comic novel, it keeps the depthless surface of its source and used the original material as a storyboard. Miller did the comic, and his codirection credit was a nod to his originality, because the credits say Rodriguez ""shot and cut"" the film (i.e., he directed it). The post-noir pornoviolent excess has been likened to ""Pulp Fiction"" by Quentin Tarantino, who ""guest directed"" one sequence (Rodriguez is his protege; parts of this could be called ""Kill Bill Three""). Its source might be better dated back to Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971), if that film had stayed with strictly storyboarded visuals, drained the Beethoven and color, and stayed with just the pornoviolence. A triptych of three episodes set in the same dystopian alternate world, the film follows the fatalistic misadventures of three antiheroes played by Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke (who got the best reviews), and Clive Owen. Of the three, I liked Owen the best: he had the spaced out look of a comic character, and registered not a single thought behind his eyes. As for whether it's worth seeing, you'll have to decide whether the film's vile, scummy view of humanity is a worthy tradeoff for the startling look at a bizarrely original world.",Sin City

There is little in the way of ""art"" here.  Unfortunately, I was suckered in by the professional reviews.  This is violence for violence's sake.  Pretty much period.  The acting is wooden, the script is lame, and there's no message to speak of.  But if what you're looking for is over-the-top violence, this is the movie for you (and possibly even the ""GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE"").  Oh, there are also a plentiful number of scantily clad or partially unclad young, attractive women.  And as the other reviews make clear, much of the violence is explicitly within the context of sex (or the sex business, or as a substitute for sex, or...).  Some of it was pretty disturbing.  Or it would have been if the visuals weren't done in the spirit of the original comic book rather than real life (oh, I'm sorry, ""graphic novel"").  Of course, that's the main drawing point of the movie, the linkage of violence and sex.  As repellant as I found this movie to be, they did do a excellent job of sticking to their main point.  I found it pretty darn misogynistic really, but it just may be your cup of tea.  Of course, the black and white visuals with splashes of color was an interesting approach, but not worth sitting through the movie for.

Beautiful sexy women turned on by blood and gore.  Sex, rape, murder, torture, cannibalism all glorified like these are the best ideas a person can have to make their life more meaningful.<br /><br />It should have been rated X, and the commercial should let you know how much nudity, blood, gore, sex, and violence is in the movie, instead of showing it as if it were artsy and clever.<br /><br />There is no story, or very little story.

I have never read the comic books on which this movie is based on, so I was confused out of my mind. The movie went from one story to another, without any real connection between stories. The characters are shot time and time again, and yet live on with barely any signs of suffering. This movie is pretty much just violence and hookers. No real story or plot. Just violence and hookers.

But with much disappointment, I cannot give this film a good rating.  In fact, the only reason I do give it two stars is that I'll give them credit for trying new things, like trying to transfer the ""look"" of the comic onto the screen - and maybe for Bruce Willis' role, as well.  But the sum of the parts is that this is a disappointing film.<br /><br />  The movie's biggest flaw is that it tries much too hard to be ""noir,"" as if a room full of Hollywood executives were sitting around saying ""let's make this noir.""  It simply doesn't work that way.  I don't how to articulate exactly the kind of artificiality that the film exhudes, but I would use a film like Kill Bill as a contrast: in that film, Tarantino is able to make a kung-fu movie; he didn't make a movie that ""tried"" to be a kung-fu movie.  Apply that to this film, except the other way around.  It tries way too hard to be something, so much that it is distractingly apparent.  The film seems to be saying ""look at these stylized, hyper-visuals; look at this black and white; look at this ultra-violence,"" without once really asking us to look at the movie itself.  I honestly wish I could have given this movie a better review, but I just can't.

5302154,B004SIPA0A, AV1R199BSRBL6,1.0, The Worst Movie I've Seen This Year,"I'm absolutely stunned at the rave reviews this absurdity has recieved. This movie was comedic where it tried to be serious, it was inexplicable when it should have been realistic, and it was above all irritating to watch. Everyone I was with came to that same consensus. And don't think I'm some thirty-five-year-old uncultured religious fundamentalist whining about violence and sex in movies. I'm a fifteen-year-old guy who went to the movie with other fifteen and sixteen year old guys.<br /><br /> First, the good. If all you care about in a movie is hot women, you've got it covered. The style that the movie was shot in was also quite entertaining. It was certainly a feast for the eyes, which makes me wonder if the critics are that easily swayed by a new idea to give a movie a shining review. If it weren't for the splashes of brilliant color in between all the grey, would the critics have thought it was such a great, groundbreaking movie? No. They would have said it was inexplicable and humorous, such as I. Now let me move on to the truly awful:<br /><br /> Can someone please explain to me why after the main character in the middle segment got ran over by a car twice, shot with a gun over and over and over again, and punched out, he can still get back up and walk around shooting people. No, not just shooting people-killing them instantly with one shot! Does anyone else see the inconsistency here? Also, was it truly necessary to have an incapacitated head start speaking in the middle of a serious action sequence? Was that meant to be a joke? I couldn't tell.<br /><br /> Furthermore, isn't the ""hookers run this city and have a pact with the police"" thing a little cliche and played out? Also, the pulling off of penises made me want to gag.<br /><br /> The acting was horrendous, but what else should you expect from Brittany Murphy, Taryn Manning and Jessica Alba? Even Bruce Willis, a favorite of mine, disappointed (For a good new Bruce flick, catch ""Hostage"").<br /><br /> Without it's stylized directing and visuals, it would be dubbed a piece of crap by the critics and by audiences alike.<br /><br /> But, you could still go for a good laugh, I guess.<br /><br /> Grade: D-<br /><br /> Cliche-filled cheese.",Sin City

The reason for me to go see this movie is Jessica Alba and Bruce Willis.  Jessica Alba really can dance and she is very sexy in the movie.<br /><br />The only thing that is not that good in this movie is that about 3/4, the movie is getting a little bit boring.

Each of this movie's stories are  so morally childish they seem as if they were written by sixth-graders. None of them are truly coherent, nor do they make any real sense; there is an almost total lack of real human emotions, motivations, etc., that would explain the Road Runner-like violence. The acting is so hammy and heavy-handed that even if it were intended as a satire on the whole film-noir shtick, it still fails miserably. The horrendously bad dialogue would have been funny if it wasn't for the film's violence, which, by itself, speaks volumes about its creators as well as the people who praise this stinking piece of trash.

5302158,B004SIPA0A, A15R2CZGDVYX4U,1.0, Revolting and Childish-Dumb.  Gross-out Comic Updated.,"Remember those ultra-violent ""CREEP""-type horror comix that used to sit beside Superman, Batman, and Spiderman on variety-store racks in the late 60s?  They apparently evolved (DEvolved?) into the ""Graphic Novel""....a modern pic-book format that is simply a more stylishly presented comic book.  Computer-moviemaking has progressed to the point that these gratuitously violent cartoons can be presented onscreen.  SIN CITY is a hyper-stylized, cartoonish film that blends actors--sometimes in ridiculous pancake makeup (a la DICK TRACY)--with a pseudo-film-noir black-and-white/splash-of-single-color ""look"" and improbable, ultra-violent special effects.  Sick stuff, with cannibalism, child molestation and murder, and bloody pound-the-head-to-a-pulp violence forming the basis for short, brainless stories of revenge and glorified depravity.  Even Mickey Rourke's grotesque ""hero"", in the longest segment of this disjointed, adolescent mess, is supposed to be laudable for his habit of torturing--in blood-spattering detail--all bad guys who get in his way.  The simple-minded moral basis here is that as long as you wear the white hat, any violence you commit against anyone on the ""opposite side"" is justified.  A real Republican, reactionary, fascist-WASP point of view.  This movie is gratuitous, occasionally visually arresting (but the style gets old fast), and loaded with disgusting images worthy of those pimple-faced , maladjusted adolescence male punks who used to lurk around the hall lockers in high-school trading joints and cigarettes while plotting to be late for every class.  Don't waste your time.  Even the scrumptious current pop-tart Jessica Alba is poorly displayed....you don't really get the sense that she's there at all.  Maybe it's all that gloom and artificial shadow.  A crappy burp-echo of classic 40s film-noir.  Don't waste your time or money.",Sin City
5302159,B004SIPA0A, A2MK0CM0GEBFFO,2.0, Great visuals but couldn't stomach the horrible dialogue,"I am a big fan of Frank Miller's work and I loved reading the graphic novels the movie was adapted from. When I saw this film I was blown away by the visuals. It had an amazing graphic style that was very different than anything I had seen in a movie before.<br /><br />Having mentioned it's good points I have to say I was enormously disappointed with the dialogue and some of the story adaptation to screen. It seems to me those involved in the screenplay and production were too concerned with adapting this in an overly faithful manner from the graphic novel to the big screen. For the most part the bad dialogue and some of the terrible acting in parts were just too painful to sit through. I had to keep checking to see if my ears were bleeding yet.<br /><br />Each extraordinarily bad line or horribly acted sequence made we wince like I was being mugged. What works in a graphic novel doesn't necessarily work as well when adapted directly to screen without a bit more adaptation than you'll see here. All the characters were severely and tragically 2-dimensional with none of the depth you get from reading the graphic novel and very little attention was paid to developing better dialogue suitable for a big screen experience. Also, many of the big name actors in this movie were capable of much better performances than they displayed here.<br /><br />Purists and rabid fans of the graphic novel may be capable of somehow finding a way to look past all the terrible acting and awful dialogue that is rife throughout the film. However, my bottom line opinion is it's a good film to watch for the visual look only, but you will almost certainly enjoy it far more if you keep the 'mute' button on. This film had the potential to be truly great but it is extremely disappointing that it fell so far short of that mark.",Sin City

And what is Peckinpah's reputation among the young, today? Exactly--Sam who?? (and that meager reputation is well-deserved; film as art, nor craft, didn't benefit from Sam Peckinpah) His films were just as bad; hokey-thin plots and monotonous over-kill violence for its' own sake--sure, it creates an ""atmosphere"", and if the viewer needs that element in film in order to consider it 'break-through entertainment' or ""film noir"", then I say, ""If God didn't want them sheered, he wouldn't have made them sheep"". There's nothing new here; in fact, it's all grindingly familiar in a borish way.

His low deadpan monotone spewing 3rd grade dialogue, coupled with action-adventure violence that is deemed 'unacceptable' for TV only means that such dribble can't be viewed for free--but it's definitely not worth even a matinee's price nor 2 hours out of one's life--we gave up after about 20 minutes.<br /><br />If imitation is Hollywood's sincerest form of flatulence, Peckinpah should be smilin'... and Tarantino too, for having skinned all the willing sheep from their money.

As interesting and well done as the movie is from a visual standpoint, I couldn't have cared less about the characters.  Everyone in the aptly named Sin City is morally bankrupt.  They do all the wrong things for the ""right"" reasons, which usually means rescuing a damsel in distress from a child molester or serial killer cannibal.  Violence is the norm in this twisted bizarro world.  In addition to routine shootings you'll also find neck-slashing, impaling, amputation, beheading and body parts being ripped out.  At times I felt like I was watching a horror movie, especially when Alexis Bledel shows up as a double-crossing hooker.<br /><br />All the stories in this movie take place only at night, and the whole thing is shot in stark black and white with a few splashes of color here and there.  The tough guy ""heroes"" talk in hoarse, low voices, even when they're not doing hokey film noir narration.  As much as I love Clive Owen, he comes across as laughable at times, but the big surprise here is Rosario Dawson.  She does an amazing job with what she's given.",Sin City

5302176,B004SIPA0A, A3ONCOK36KPOV8,4.0, Good Film-Some Odd Reviewer Comments,"Sin City is a visually striking film. It fully succeeds in capturing the feel of the graphic novel it is based on and of Film Noir in general. The acting is also good, within the limitations of the comic book-style chosen by the film-maker. The interlinked stories are well told. Some of the comments of previous reviewers are, however, puzzling. For example, in a film which is filled with eye-gouging, torture, mutilations, and amputations, not a few reviewers found time to comment on the ""graphic nudity"", which consisted of a couple of brief, shadowy shots of breasts. One aspect of American Culture I have always found puzzling is the propensity to view the most ghastly and sadistic forms of violence as ""good wholesome entertainment"" while a glimpse of an exposed nipple on television sends the whole nation into hysterics. Don't get me wrong, I love this country, but that is a bit of a paradox. A second odd comment I've seen concerns the supposed mysogyny of this film. Yes, most of the female characters are prostitutes, but the film is about the underbelly of society. Most of these women are portrayed as intelligent, strong, and perfectly capable of defending themselves. They are actually shown in a far more positive light than any of the male characters, who are almost universally portrayed as brutal, sadistic cavemen who are apparently obsessed with attacking other men's genitals. If anything, the film is more anti-male (mysandrous?) than mysogynistic.",Sin City

You more than likliy know if you are going to enjoy this movie before you even read my review... hell you probably knew if you would like this film just by looking at the cover art for the DVD. Sin City is a world where the good guys are murderers and the bad guys are worse. Where no matter how far down the gutter your life has gone, there is always one last shot at redemption. Where bullets fly, blood sprays, and jazz music plays in the background. Not everyone will enjoy this film, in fact I would go so far as to say that the movie is more of an ""aquired taste"". I commend Robert Rodriguez for having the guts to make a movie with such high production values and expensive star power, while knowing this film is far from the main-stream, and will probably only be appreciated by a select few. you, the reader know what kind of movies you enjoy, and If you are the type who likes the movies that your friends never quite understand, Sin City is a world you must experience.

SEE THIS FILM!",Sin City
5302181,B004SIPA0A, AKP9OHP8RO3TS,5.0," Rodriguez, Miller prove 'Sin' is in","Movies derived from comic books are not exactly the easiest to make. Directors and writers have to know the boundaries of their characters. Remaining faithful to the source material is key. And if they do cross the line, they'll be feeling the wrath of every aggravated 18-34 year old, memorabilia collecting, Klingon fluent fan-boy for years.<br /><br />It does help however when the writer of the film happens to be the author and creator of the comic book being derived from. What makes it even better is getting a director who is a fan-boy himself. This is exactly what happened in the case of Sin City.<br /><br />Director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Spy Kids) had been badgering legendary comic book writer/artist Frank Miller for years to bring his most cherished series to the big screen. After much pestering and a secret audition featuring Josh Hartnett (which is used for the opening of the film), Miller was convinced to green-light the project. In fact, Rodriguez was so hell-bent on staying true to the comic that he actually resigned from The Directors' Guild of America just to allow Miller to be credited as Co-Director.<br /><br />Translating the books to screen rather than adapting them, Rodriguez used all of Miller's original artwork as storyboards. Filmed entirely on green screen with digital cameras, the results are nothing short of amazing. The shadowy characters, the gritty cityscapes, the violence, the signature rain, the chain-smoking, the black and white film noir influences, the minimalist usage of bright colors -- and yes, even severed body parts - appear just as Miller had envisioned.<br /><br />The movie boasts an impressive, all-star ensemble cast which includes Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Nick Stahl, Mickey Rourke, Jaime King, Elijah Wood, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson and Benicio Del Toro. Perhaps the reasoning behind this much star power is that each story is of its own entity. Yet, the tales are seamlessly intertwined and the film paces well.<br /><br />In the first entry ""That Yellow Bastard"", Willis is a haggard cop battling a pedophile (Stahl). The role seems to be tailor-made for Willis who gives it just the edge it needs. Sure his portrayal may be stereotypical at times, but he makes it work with ease.<br /><br />""The Hard Goodbye"" is probably the most enjoyable story. Buried under layers of prosthetics, Mickey Rourke is at the top of his game as Marv, a tough-as-nails bruiser who sets out to avenge the death of his hooker girlfriend Goldie (King). When he ends up at the house of a mute cannibal (Wood), the sadomasochistic madness ensues in the most ridiculous of fashions.<br /><br />The third segment ""The Big Fat Kill"", though way over-the-top, features some of the most memorable moments of the film. Clive Owen plays Dwight, a good guy trying to cover up the death of a crooked cop (Del Toro) in order to preserve a negotiation of power between the law and a town run by hookers (led by Rosario Dawson). Keep your eyes open for an intense car scene directed by Rodriguez's good friend, the master of front seat dialogue himself: Quentin Tarantino.<br /><br />Shot and cut entirely by Rodriguez, Sin City is a triumph. The splashes of color and it's pulpy, film noir style are both abrasive and dazzling. Combined with Miller's sensationally slick dialogue, the result is a beautiful and timeless classic, which will undoubtedly be shown in future film schools for many years to come. Fan-boys rejoice. Robert Rodriguez is on your side.",Sin City
5302182,B004SIPA0A, A1B4NBFZJY2FIZ,5.0, Free your mind and your *** will follow,"Sin City is definitely one of the must-see movies for this century, but be warned, this is not your regular kind of movie. If you want to see pedestrian, boring fantasy movie making, or trite, one-dimensional moralizing, stick to the horrendousness that is the Star Wars Prequels.<br /><br />Frank Miller's Sin City is far, far more than just a splatter-fest although it's got violence a-plenty.  If violence worries you at all, then DON'T GO.  However, if you can dig it, then I'll say this: the physical violence in this movie is deliberately cartoonish, and therefore much less psychically scarring than say ""Silence of the Lambs"".  There's other kinds of violence in Miller's creative work, however and on that I'll say more later.<br /><br />The movie is visually beautiful. It is _very_ much in keeping with Miller's graphic novels, but whilst  the graphic novels were completely black and white, Sin City the movie is actually super-saturated dark blues and grays. There is very little real black in the movie except Rosario Dawson's outfit  (what little there was of it anyway).<br /><br />This point has also been made before but it's worth saying again:  The movie is NOT meant to be realistic. This is the key to Frank Miller's whole visual style (of which more below).  If you like your movies literal and simpering then STAY AWAY from this movie. You won't like it, and you don't belong in the movie theater.<br /><br />As many, many other people have pointed out, the movie is _meant_  to be stylized, so the acting, the dialog and the visual style are all meant to be larger than life. Good grief. Have we become so blinkered, mentally-enslaved and unimaginative as a society that people can't even figure that out?  What stylization does is allow the ideas and emotional contours in the movie (and in Miller's graphic novels) to become more salient.  As with other non-realist forms of art, the deliberate break from naturalistic images allows us to see past the images to the ideas and feelings beneath them, and that's what a lot of people seem to have missed.<br /><br />On the subject of the acting, yes Mickey Rourke and Benicio did great jobs, but they also had the best lines.  I think the WOMEN in this movie acted their asses off, especially given the limited amount of talking they had.  What this meant was that a lot had to be conveyed by physical movement and facial expression.  Dawson did this wonderfully as Gail, the leader of the Second Amendment -hoisting prostitutes, and Jessica Alba did a pretty good job too although she hid way too much behind her  ""Little Nancy"" persona. This, I think, gave her much less to work with and so Alba's Nancy wasn't nearly as interesting a character as Dawson's Gail.  Personally I thought Devon Aoki's Miho was great.  No emoting, but then she wasn't supposed to. Before the movie came out, I had read some fan-boy stuff about how Zhang Ziyi would have been a better choice for Miho, but I don't think so.  Ms. Zhang is far too given to facial histrionics. Ms Aoki was perfect.  Also excellent was Brittany Murphey as Shellie the waitress, this was a spot-on casting decision, as Shellie has Murphey's Jersey Girl persona written all over her.<br /><br />Lastly, one of the defining themes in Miller's writing career from ""Batman: the Dark Knight Returns"", through ""Ronin"" and ""Daredevil"" to Sin City, is his profound contempt for the hypocrisy and self-servingness of those in authority.  Those who are attracted to order and paternal moralism will hate this movie because these are exactly the things that Miller has his characters take on.  One of the things that Sin City and Dark Knight share is the stark distinction between violence you do while doing the right thing and violence done while going along to get paid, or because you enjoy using your authority to prey on others. _This_ is the difference between the villains and the heroes in this movie.<br /><br />Violence then, in Miller and Rodriguez's world becomes a way for the dispossessed to reclaim their dignity and agency.  It's fantasy, it's id-laden but it's meant to be a work of fiction not a blue print for social justice.<br /><br />Note that Miller does not say that violence is 100% successful: Both Marv and Hartigan must die at the end of their respective vengeance quests.  In fact, the only male figure who survives is (interestingly) Dwight, the only guy who allies himself with powerful female characters (Rosario Dawson's Gail and Devon Aoki's Miho). Lone males, it seems, are more vulnerable than men and women working together.<br /><br />Miller's Sin City  is definitely less diverse and more androcentric than the Wachowskis' Matrix universe, but you don't have to be PC all the time to make a useful point.  Sure the prostitutes were all female, and sure this leaves the whole business of who the sex trade is set up for to one side. But the prostitutes in Sin City were independant workers, running their own society without male bosses and profiteers (a very far cry from the real-world sex trade, of course) and their independance is what they were fighting to protect.  For this reason, and because the real villains in this peice were all male. I think this is a far more complex movie than a lot of people want to think it is.  Skimpy outfits and sex work does not simply equate to misogyny.<br /><br />Go see this movie. It is a complex and compelling riff on morality, friendship, fighting city hall and (mostly) losing, getting old and getting by.  The delighted vengefulness which imbues this movie comes from nothing so much as our own outrage when the suits and their toadying minions stomp down on the rest of us: ""Kill him for me Marv. Kill him good.""",Sin City
5302183,B004SIPA0A, AXOS8IWBXNZGT,4.0, City of Sin,"This past Sunday, I went to see Sin City, another in my recent binge of comic-book-based flicks. The film is comprised of three main stories. One features an unrecognizable Mickey Roarke as a reformed ex-con enforcer-type, who's been set up for murder. Another features Bruce Willis as an about-to-retire straight-shooter cop, who takes the fall for a nasty crime he didn't commit. The last features Clive Owen as a defender of the Old Town ladies of the evening, who run into a spot of trouble when they off an abusive, seedy chap who turns out to be a cop. There's a large, talented, well-known cast...except for Jessica Alba, who's nice looking but I'm not yet convinced that she's picked up any acting chops.<br /><br />The movie's cinematography has the feel of a comic book, right down to its core. Everything's noir-ish, in primary comic-book colors, with odd camera angles that give it just that right feeling. The dialog is similarly stylized, and it's also pretty crude at times...not for younger children. Lots of stylized, noir-ish violence to be seen here as well. Just for reference, there's nowhere near as much violence here as in, say, Kill Bill Volume 1.<br /><br />All in all, I was pretty pleased with the movie. Surprised by how will Roarke did; it's been a long time since I've seen him in anything. Worth seeing...but don't be taking your kids.",Sin City

Kinda scary since I watched it by myself!! But I sincerely thought it was that good.<br /><br />It's a comic book vividly brought to life. The special effects are outrageous and over-the-top, just as they should be. It's fun to be drawn into a fantasy world that's full of action, suspense and death-defying feats.<br /><br />The use of color was both brilliant and stunning. Among other things, it purposefully spares you the gory images of brutally violent actions - just enough to remind you that it is a fictional world. But there's plenty of graphic violence and gore (among other things) ... so this most definitely isn't one for the kids!<br /><br />The cast includes dozens of actors from diverse backgrounds. Like most films Tarantino is involved in, you'll see unexpected performances from people you probably never have imagined in that role.

I decided to watch this movie because the credicts raved about this movie, to me after watching it--a very big disappointment.  Here are things that I did not like about the movie.  First, Bruce Willis acts exactly same no matter which movie he is in.  He has one facial expression for everything. When I thought he was killed of very early in the movie, I became very happy thinking that I don't have to put up with him anymore, but he came back towards end of the movie. I generally don't watch any movies with him in it.  Second, I heard some professional movie credict say that the running scene in which Bruce runs through the forest was a great scene, because it was done with a forest back drop and that he was not actually running throught the woods.  Well, after watching this scence, my friends and I thought it was not a big deal.  In fact, the whole scene looked very fake to us.  It actually look like a fake back drop was moving while he was just running in one place.  I think it would have looked better if he was really running in the woods.  Third, the white brightness of the movie really bothered my eyes.  I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the movie,  Fourth, The dialog was just oful, more of one liners throughout the whole movie.  Fifth, When a crook throws a garnade, some people got killed and others who were blown clear away had not even one scratches on them and they were perfectly fine.  Some people got shot many times in the chest and got killed, while others got the same thing but just walked away.  Sixth, Why does all the girls including the female pro officer walked around wearing skanky clothes.  Almost all the females in the movie were prostutes.  No wonder the females in the real life have a tough time being taken seriously.  This movie was nothing but violence, nudity, bad dialog, bad acting, bad lighting, and confusion.  I would not recommend this trash to anyone.",Sin City

The whole movie, from start to finish is narrated. It's like the directors are playing ""dollies"" with the actors. Or as if they don't trust the actors to convey the stories correctly or the viewer to understand, so they're going to tell you exactly what the story is. Ho, hum. And I don't care how much violence there is in this film, because there is an overabundance they could do less with, it is still a ho-hummer. The movie is apparently a chain of ""pulp fiction"" stories, most of them having nothing to do with anything or each other, other than to stretch the movie out so it won't be a short film. I'm guessing Tarantino's attempt to remake the Switchblade Sisters fails miserably and unconvincingly.

And the directors seem to be unable to decide if they want to make a live action movie, or an animated movie, so what you get is a weird combination  of both.  It was ridiculous how the characters in the movie were so hard to kill, especially Marv (Mickey Rourke).  And the movie had cannibalism in it, and people being hacked up with saws.

I do not object to the violence.  What bothered me about this film is that when characters basically cannot be injured by weapons, I don't care what happens anymore.  I like films where the appearance of a weapon makes me tense.

The next character kidnaps women, makes them watch as he eats their body parts, cuts off their heads and mounts them on a wall and then has his pet wolf eat the rest of the body.  This character segways into a bishop, who also enjoys eating the bodies of the women with his friend.  And this depraved plot goes on and on.<br /><br />What probably most amazed me was that it didn't appear that anyone else in the theatre was remotely upset with  what they were seeing.

I watched Sin City last night and I think  that it is one of the more violent trash-movies I've ever seen. Violence is always a bad thing but in this case is senseless and really stupid. Americans should realize that this country is one of the more violent in the world. People kills each other sometimes only for the pleasure of killing (think about the sniper in the Washington DC area 3 years ago) One of the reasons for this is what we see in the movies. And this movie is an example of that. Frank Miller is a mental-illed guy and his stories should be avoided at any cost. Don't buy or see this piece of garbage!",Sin City

Marv is someones idea of what a hero is supposed to be I guess. But he is clearly not mine. Bruce willis has a strong role here but its not enough to save this movie.

And, unfortunately, it's about 40 percent too long. If whittled down to just two chapters, it would have been great popcorn entertainment, a heck of a violent ride from beginning to end.<br /><br />On a side note, just because people express negative opinions about a post, that doesn't mean the opinion isn't valid, rather, it can often mean that the people disliking an honest critique of a movie are simpletons far too easily amused.<br /><br />But back to the movie, the chapters with Mickey O'Rourke and Bruce Willis are great. But the one with Clive Owen goes on far too long, with too many pseudo endings. And the opening and closing act suffers because Josh Hartnett comes off as the clothing model that he was -- all surface, no depth. He's more wooden than Hayden Christensen's performance as Mannequin Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars prequels.<br /><br />An interesting study in how to make a movie look and feel like a comic book come to life, but some emotional depth and resonance would have given these chapters some depth, and make us care for what happens to the characters. But as it is, it's just cheap laughs and a big-budget exercise in style over substance. Sure, your friends might think you hip and cool for going along with the crowd and singing the praises of Sin City, but honesty will make you more original and an independent thinker, free of the simplistic views of most of your peers.<br /><br />Yes, the simplistic kind of thinking (or non-thinking) that will have people saying my review, and others that are critical of this movie, are bad ones.",Sin City

You're encouraging him.  Don't encourage him.  Let him move on to make something with a modicum of depth!  (Both in look and story.)<br /><br />I saw Sin City at a sneak preview for film critics and fanboys before it even came out.  My friend got tickets from a comic store.  I am probably the biggest fan of Rodriguez out there.  I really wanted the film to be good.  I was so amped on the trailers, I showed my students them for two months.  I show his 10 minute Flick School on breaks, his home studio tour during class, etc.  I am his biggest fan.<br /><br />BUT:<br /><br />If you like bad British TV shows and bad off off off Broadway theater, you will love Sin City.  The makeup on that Yellow B*st*rd was worth the price of admission to a true fanboy--it was phenomenal; but everything else just blew blew blew.  From shot selection to story to dialogue to bad green screen work to pace to character development, it just was a major disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, I wanted it to be good, but it was so bad people were laughing at it and some even booed it afterward.<br /><br />Shot selection: I foamed at the mouth that he was going to try to shoot it as close to the panels as possible.  It didn't work.  I was constantly going, ok, who is talking to whom?  Its called establishing shots, Robert.  It took me out of it.  The setups were HORRIBLE.  The poor environments are partly to blame, but it mostly felt like everything was shot on a green screen the width of a car, and with the height of about 7 feet.  Everything seemed to be in medium shots and close-ups!!  You'd think storyboarding would be simple for something emulating the great Sin City, but it just didn't transfer well onto the big screen.<br /><br />story: vignette style, which I didn't mind, but I couldn't get into the characters at all.  With no character development, the story seemed all sizzle, no steak. 20 minutes into it, no lie, I thought it was going to be over bc i thought I had sat through an hour and a half, but it kept going on and on.  I was expecting it to end, and it didn't.  The vignette style at least let you know that the next chapter would be coming soon, which meant it was closer to ending.<br /><br />Dialogue: it was so uneven!  I love film noir dialogue, but no time was spent getting it right with these modern actors (half were miscast--that chick from Gilmore Girls stuck out like a sore thumb!  Shame on her for sucking so bad!)  People were laughing at the dialogue.  Literally, three times I thought they were joking but they were being serious.  There is one good part: one guy gets shot with an arrow and it's the best part of the movie. Dialogue was tough too buy bc I didn't buy the environments, and when you don't buy that something is REAL, then everything else seems fake too.<br /><br />My biggest thing: If you're going to build an all digital city, make it look like its more than one block.  And the 3d environments were ""gorpy"" like some shots in Star Wars 1.  Sin City had no depth, it had half depth.  The clean 2d style of the comic books was there in ending panels, and they looked hot.  You have to go for it all the way if you're going to move away from the 2d, and they went halfway.<br /><br />HD doesn't look good with high key lighting.  Sin City is all about high key lighting.  I'm a huge fan of HD, but HD needs low lighting (Collateral, etc) to look like film.  The whole film seemed 3 layers away from believability.  Hence, the British TV slam. (I'm sorry, Robert!)<br /><br />Ok, now the big one.  The reason why this movie didn't work, ultimately, was the script.  IT WAS ONE LONG MONOLOGUE. Film is showing, not telling, and you learn every little thing that's going on in the minds of every protagonist.  For example, Bruce Willis is hanging out of a car trying to shoot someone.  Instead of just rockin' action, he has an inner dialogue! explaining why the other guy is missing hitting him--and then he tells you why his own shot will be on target, and gives you extra info about that even, and then he finally friggin' shoots the guy.  I was like, ""Shoot him, Yellow B*st*rd!  Wait, no, shoot me!""  the whole thing felt so slow bc of this.<br /><br />When you finally get to action scenes, they narrate all the way through them!  Ack!<br /><br />My friend liked it, so this is just one person's opinion.  If you haven't seen it, maybe you should get your hopes way down, so when you see it, it wont be such a colossal disappointment.  I would advise people to only borrow the DVD from a friend.  Watch it on a small TV.  I was in the 4th row.<br /><br />After seeing the film, I think he gave Frank Miller co-credit (and Tarantino too) not to be nice, but to shoulder the blame.  Rodriguez is a genius marketer.  But a turd is still a turd, no matter how much you polish it.<br /><br />I challenge you Robert to not suck.

That said, I hadn't read any of his Sin City stories and I definitely won't be reading them now.<br /><br />The thing that bothers me the most about the steaming pile of crap called Sin City is that it is being held up as an example of what comic books are truly about, with numerous reviewers touting it as the first authentic translation of a comic book.<br /><br />The only positive thing about Sin City was its visual style, specifically the limited and dramatic use of color against a backdrop of a black and white world. The acting was very poor, even by the big name actors. The dialogue was so cheesy it made me wince. And the story was trite, ridiculously gory and completely mysoginistic. The outcome of all the violence is also so unrealistic (with people getting shot repeatedly, blown up, being in horrific car crashes, etc., and then getting up and walking away as if nothing had happened) that I half expected Bugs Bunny to pop up at any moment. And some of the scenes were profoundly disturbing, and not in a good way (like the sick romance between Jessica Alba and her father-figure Bruce Willis).<br /><br />My friend was begging me to walk out after the first half-hour, but I stayed hoping the movie would get better because I really wanted to like the movie. I am completely baffled by the number of good reviews this movie has gotten. It's hard not to wonder if we saw the same film.<br /><br />Please don't leave this movie with the idea that this is what comic book fans like. Sin City is not at all representative of the diverse, mature works the comic industry is capable of.

The characters (and the actors themselves) are often quite beautiful (Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy) but not in the least bit engaging. There is not a character in the entire movie that holds any emotional appeal whatsoever and, while the film features some incredibly fine actors (Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood, Bruce Willis, Nick Stahl, etc.) all are wasted in thoroughly unlikable, one-dimensional roles. Many found this movie to be overly violent and, to a great extent, I agree. The violence is intense, but as cartoonish and one-dimensional as the characters who commit it. Yet the saddest part is that it was violence for the sake of violence (think the opposite of movies like The Godfather or Saving Private Ryan) and, as a result has no emotional resonance.

But now that Sin City-1 has paid the bills, maybe the sequel will try to aim a little higher.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Stunning hyper-noir black and white visuals<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Strict fidelity to the graphic novels - comic book stereotypes masquerading as noir protagonists<br />2. Non-existant Sin City backstory - no depth at all to the weak screenplay<br />3. Stylized, but endless and numbing ultra-violence including cannibalism, castration and suicide<br />4. Acting talent wasted with hip, cliche-dominated dialogue<br />5. Five-minute Tarantino segment embarassing parody of his neo-noir film work.<br />6. Way too little content to sustain a 2-hour plus movie.<br />7. Humorless<br /><br />Conclusion: Boring and irritating waste of potentially exciting noir visuals.",Sin City

If I could rate it with 0 stars, I would. After about 5-10 minutes, I completely lost interest. For the first time in my life of watching movies, I felt like getting up and walking out. However, I didn't as I was with a friend. Partway through the movie, my friend told me she didn't care for the movie either and we both said that we couldn't wait for it to end. Afterwards, my friend and I talked about how horrible the movie was. Other people in the theatre also mentioned their displeasure with the movie.

Basically, it's just that--a movie about violence.  Everyone's a killer and they all enjoy being killers.  Not five minutes go by (literally) without chopped off limbs flying, eyeballs popping, blood squirting, heads rolling...you get the picture.<br /><br />I've never been one to shy away from a film that shows violence and gore, but when that's all there is to the movie it gets boring real fast.  The only good thing I can say about it is I liked the crime novel style of dialogue.  But really that's about it.",Sin City

Once again, Tarrantino is overrated because of his shock techniques, and not because of any viable talent.  When I realized that there was no plot to this film, I looked for art.  No art was visible.  Basically, this film is a freakshow that freaks will enjoy...GAG!!!!",Sin City
5302237,B004SIPA0A, ALN0TTRTLHA4E,1.0, The pornography of violence,"I am probably running a bit counter to the main stream with this but really this was over the top. We have one character have his arms and legs sawn of and then he is eaten by a dog. There are two castrations and a character is killed by having his head bitten to a pulp. And these things are done by the characters who called loosely be described as the goodies.<br /><br />There does seem to be in a number of films a growing pornography of violence. Hostel, Wolf Creek, aspects of the 24 Hours series and this. Repulsive violence as an end in itself.<br /><br />Now of course this does not mean that the film is not directed by someone who knows what he is about. It is not to say that the actors are less than skilled or that the dialogue and voice over are effective and professional but really there must be some point when things just get a bit gross and I think that this film has reached it.<br /><br />In the real world police work is a grind. Police have to painstakingly catch offenders and try to construct a case against them. The majority of offenders will commit small time offences and be stupid. Police then have to try to develop ways to catch bigger time offenders when small time offenders have tipped them of as to who is there boss or who supplies them with the drugs. This requires hours of phone taps, trying to stick up minor offenders and the like so that they will roll over and pot the big guys. Not the sort of thing that makes an interesting comic book.<br /><br />Comic books are interested in battles a bit like the World Championship Wrestling. People dressed in leotards with some playing the role of good others evil. With comics like Superman or Batman the villians are usually caught in the act and the action is all about a fight over apprehension.<br /><br />To create viewer interest things are made simple. There are good guys who look nice and who we are given parts of their back story so we feel for them. Batman whose parents were killed by a criminal. Spiderman whose de-factor father died as a result of a robbery. The Punisher whose parents.....come to think of it they are all the same.<br /><br />Now in Sin City the technique is to have villians so bad that not only do we want their deaht but we want them slowly tortured to death. (There is one exception but that involves women who are scantilly clad and carry around guns.) Thus the villians have to be cannibals who not only eat their victims but cut of bits of them while they are alive and eat the portions with the victim eating on. Now whilst this is possible, (Said to be a Japanse atrocity towards the end of the war.) it seems to me to be a transperent plot devise to justify laothsome behavour.<br /><br />America is now the country which seems to think that torture is okay. That kidnaping and locking people up in Cuba without trial is okay if there is a slight suggestion of wrongdoing even if no one is sure. One can see that films like this might be either reflective of the mindset or the cause of it.",Sin City
5302238,B004SIPA0A, AIFXFHO2N9WJB,2.0, This Movie Is Sinfully Twisted & Pointless...,"I have to admit I have never read a Sin City comic, I am a comic book fan but that is one series I've never been all that interested in reading.  When I heard about the movie being made I figured I'd see the movie and if I liked it enough then I would read the comics.  Well, let me say this if the movie is any indication of the comics, then as far as the comics go, no thanks I'll pass.<br /><br />""Sin City"" follows three different storylines that really don't have much to do with each other.  One storyline focuses on an old near-retirement cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who is trying to save a young woman named Nancy (Jessica Alba), who as an 11 year old he saved from the same man that is trying to rape and kill her now.  The second storyline focuses on Marv (an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke) who after spending the night with a girl who winds up dead the next morning, goes on a rampage to find out who killed her and why.  Third, is the story of Dwight (a very wooden Clive Owen), a shady man with a mysterious past who now spends his time trying to save his new girlfriend from a crooked cop/ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />All of the storylines work decently on their own, but really don't belong in the same movie together.  Other films have used the format of having separate storylines that intertwine with one another with great success, ""Traffic"" would be a prime example, but ""Sin City"" is not one of these films.  Supposedly each of the three storylines had much more footage that was filmed and edited down for time constraints.  Now if a director's cut appears and the storylines get fleshed out then maybe this would be a somewhat better movie.  Even if that happens there are still several things wrong with this movie, the script is very clunky and sounds as if it came right off the pages of a comic book.  Some things just sound better when you're reading them in a comic and not using them to tell a story within a movie.  Another problem would be the acting, it was way too wooden from almost every actor.  I presume this is how director's Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wanted it, though the reason eludes me.<br /><br />On to some positive notes, there was some humor in the movie that helped lift certain moments in the film.  Another positive for the movie is the special effects, since the movie was filmed entirely in front of a green screen the CGI backgrounds were flawlessly mixed with the actors, unlike the terrible ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" that attempted the same trick.<br /><br />All gripes aside, ""Sin City"" is an alright movie, and I'm sure it stays incredibly faithful to the source material and for that I respect what has been created, but the movie as a whole, just didn't light my fire.  If you are a fan of the Sin City comics then I'm sure you will love this movie, but you will probably be left wanting to see the separate storylines fleshed out a bit more.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.",Sin City

A few interwoven tales of mob hits and ornery down and out or mean secondary characters thrown in for variety. It all results in a mix-up of styles that is puerile, stupid, and boring to boot.  Besides being a copy rather than a pastiche, there is no true originality here.  The MAJOR stylistic problem is that in the film noirs, the camera was an observer, so the snappy dialogue, gravely voices of the men and sweetheart tones of the femmes and broad gestures of each gender were prominent and provided 'space' to be savored and enjoyed. The failure here is that the visuals compete with the dialogue so one's attention is basically divided so neither can be appreciated.  There is just too much going on at once.  Also, adding a few kill bill rip-off tumbling acts to the mix does not help the noirish quality but rather dilutes it and renders it pointless, sort of like using the imagery of West Side Story and replacing the Bernstein/Sondheim score with gangsta rap.

I bought it because I like Bruce Willis. He's in the first story and it is 13 minutes long. Then there is a second story which was 34 of the longest minutes I've ever watched a movie. I have no idea how it ended, if it ended. The third story was so bad I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes. Seeing the movie was only half over I clicked further up the bar and came to a second part of the first story. This is where the yellow man showed up. Even though it was Bruce Willis it was BAD!!! (I bet he doesn't claim this movie on his resume.) Powers Booth was also in this part of the story and, though I like him, the movie was still bad.

It has the pathetic capability to be looked at as a comedy like Starship Troopers, yet carries questionable scenes and voice over that make me wonder if the filmakers took themselves seriously.  Either way, the final product is a complete joke.  The style of the film is essentially the bones of the film.  It makes no difference, becuase there is no effort to make every shot flow into an actual piece of visual mastery.  Either the visual concept wasn't fluid, or the editing was done by an inbred fan of ""children of the Living Dead.  The acting was interesting, and basically terrible.  Clive Owen posessed the clever death tactic of drowning people in the toilet which realy wasn't as funny as it sounds because the charachters would force out their pathetic dialouge that touched on some form of phylisophical darkness posessed by pompus Eighth grade maralyn manson fans who cut their wrists and wear short sleaved slipnot t-shirts just to brag of their misery.<br /><br />I wanted to watch the car chase that was directed by Quentin Tarentino, but I had given up hope so I left.  My logic told me that a car chase, even if it was directed by quentin tarentino cannot save a movie posessing a chuck taylor-wearing villain who eat's people's souls.<br /><br />Even if Orson welles walked onto the set and redirected and stared in the whole rest of the movie, it probably wouldn't have done much good for the fate of this film.

Instead of Sky Captain's sepia shadings, this one is in vividly rendered black-and-white with carefully selected splashes of color (perhaps inspired by Steven Spielberg's use of a red coat in the otherwise black-and white <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012QM8G"">Schindler's List</a>). It evokes the perfect feeling for its modern-day film noir sensibilities which includes pulp fiction-type dialogue and a rogue's gallery of exaggerated characters, some made up in prosthetics to make you think you've landed in the dark side of a Dick Tracy comic strip. But Miller's world feels much different, at once capturing the cartoonish, highly stylized violence of Quentin Tarnatino's films (he is identified as ""Special Guest Director"" though I'm unclear what he exactly did) and the special effects-driven black humor of Robert Zemeckis' <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225482"">Death Becomes Her</a> (which coincidentally starred Bruce Willis).<br /><br />The plot revolves around three separate stories that share some of the supporting characters but little more than that story-wise. Continuing to improve and deepen with age, Willis plays a tough-talking cop named Hartigan in the first one. Just before accepting his pension, he pursues one last case to save an 11-year old girl from the clutches of a murderous psychopath who happens to be the son of a US senator. The girl grows up to be a stripper, played blandly by a Lolita-esque Jessica Alba. Completely unrecognizable as the actor who once enticed and coerced Kim Basinger in Adrian Lyne's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004XMV6"">9 1/2 Weeks</a>, Mickey Rourke portrays Marv, a contract killer who falls in love with a beautiful hooker who is murdered in her sleep. His journey in finding her killer creates the most concurrently harrowing and darkly hilarious joyride in the movie, replete with decapitated heads of beautiful women mounted on a wall, a mute psycho-killer played by Elijah Wood (stunt casting for sure but intriguing in exposing a dark side to his Frodo persona) and a comic electric-chair execution scene. Rourke is a revelation, grotesquely ugly and built like a Mac truck but strangely insightful and impervious to what happens to his character.<br /><br />The third story is the most surreal with a monotone-voiced Clive Owen, an almost heroic fugitive named Dwight, who saves a mouthy barmaid (an annoying Brittany Murphy) and a gang of empowered prostitutes (led by his former lover played in convincing dominatrix fashion by Rosario Dawson) from a corrupt cop. A Cyrano-nosed Benicio del Toro portrays the cop with his trademark fiery menace in what feels like a throwback to his career before <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067IZ3"">Traffic</a>. Dead people don't stay dead in any of the stories, but in this one, the concept is taken to an extreme, and the clutches between Owen and Dawson amid the violence provide a surprisingly amusing touch. Everybody seems to be having a good time, and it's nice to see some otherwise under-the-radar actors get a chance to chew on some scenery in atypical roles, chief among them Carla Gugino as a perennially nude lesbian parole officer, Nick Stahl as the senator's son who becomes the comically disgusting Yellow Bastard, and in seething, whatever-happened-to-them cameos, Powers Boothe and Rutger Hauer.<br /><br />All the ingredients are so over-the-top that I was hoping the three stories would synthesize more than they do perhaps in the hope of a greater untapped theme. Moreover, for a movie so dependent on style to sustain itself over its two-hour-plus running time, it does feel a bit overlong and at times, repetitive in its visual elements. After all, one can take in only so many severed heads and limbs and heads shoved in toilets, as well as the inordinate amount of blood splattering in colors ranging from red to white to yellow. But no matter, as Rodriguez and Miller have fashioned something quite startling and entertaining here, a comic book come to life. Not for everyone's tastes but this is fun for those willing to take the ride. The incremental value of the two-disc Collector's Edition DVD set over the standard <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTX"">single disc</a> will depend on whether you have become obsessed with this cult film since there is only a behind-the-scenes featurette on the single disc.<br /><br />Disc One contains the 124-minute, theatrical-release version with an excessive three audio commentaries. The first is with Rodriguez and Miller, who focus mainly on the book-to-screen translation and benefits from the author's perspective. The second has Tarantino and Willis join Rodriguez, and the focus turns to the technical aspects of the production even though Tarantino's contribution to the film is marginal at best. The third commentary track is actually the recording of the audience reaction at the movie's Austin premi&egrave;re in order to replicate the experience one would have had at the theater. The remaining extras on Disc One may seem superfluous if you already sat through the first two commentary tracks. Six featurettes are offered - a five-minute short on how Miller and Rodriguez got together (""How It Went Down: Convincing Frank Miller to Make the Film""); seven minutes on Tarantino's contribution to ""The Big Fat Kill"" segment (""Special Guest Director, Quentin Tarantino"");  seven minutes on the vintage 1950's cars used in the film; en minutes focused mainly on the weaponry; nine minutes with special makeup effects supervisor Greg Nicotero on how the looks of the principal characters were achieved; and finally, nine minutes with costume supervisor Nina Proctor about the stylized clothing. There is an odd feature on Disc One, ""Sin-Chroni-City Interactive"", which allows you to pick characters and locations and get a timeline view of relevant events. Disc One ends with two theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Disc Two contains the 147-minute version of the film advertised as ""recut, extended, and unrated"". The additional 23 minutes amount to expanded cuts in each episode which allow them to be presented as separate short films. This gives you the option to watch the film as an integrated whole or separately. Each segment has its own menu of scene selections. From a story standpoint, the incremental value of the footage and flexibility is marginal at best. Five more featurettes fill up Disc Two - a twelve-minute short called ""15 Minute Flic School"" in which Rodriguez shares behind-the-scenes information and basic tricks of the trade; ten minutes where the entire film is shown in accelerated fashion to show how the actors had to improvise in front of green screens; a 17-minute piece on Tarantino's shooting of his scene; and most dispensable, nine minutes of a concert from Willis and his band the Accelerators at Antone's nightclub in Austin, and six minutes  of Rodriguez sharing his recipe for ""Sin City"" breakfast tacos (seriously!).

5302265,B004SIPA0A, AR9SWRG4RQA9Y,2.0," Faithful, yetdisappointing","First off, I am a huge Frank Miller fan! Read the Sin City comics from the start. While I respect the great effort to remain faithful to the source material, I think this movie fails on many levels. Some of the acting is terrible, lines that might work in a comic book word balloon just come off stiff and goofy on screen. Michael Madsen's acting stands out the most! Was he underpaid?<br /><br />The Cast<br />Bad - Frodo as serial killer? Bruce Willis as a 60 year old cop? Jessica Alba, great body, no acting skills - see Fantastic Four, or entire career. Bleh. Wouldn't less famous actors have been a better choice?<br /><br />Good - Mickey Rourke as Marv. Roy Batty (I mean Rutger Hauer) actually works as a Cardinal. Rosario Dawson, perfect look for Gail. Brittany Murphy as Shellie, perfect! These are all based on look, acting is mediocre for the most part, I blame the script more than anything.<br /><br />The Look<br />The film is both faithful to the source material and beautiful, environments, clothing, rain all bathed in a world of impenetrable shadow and glowing light, work as they did on the comic book page. But the actors faces are lit with more definition, mid-tones, etc. which is weird. A world bathed in shadow should effect people too, right? When actors are not the primary focus on screen, the look is incredible. Other times, actors just seem pasted on top, very distracting.<br /><br />Most comic book movies are hurt by odd changes to the source material. Others by avoiding the big expensive special effects, no Galactus in Fantastic Four! Sin City suffers from the opposite.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie with the look of Sin City where the actors and environments mesh perfectly, check out Renaissance! The Sin City story is better, but visually, Renaissance works much better.<br /><br />Maybe Sin City 2 will be better, regardless of my disappointment, I will see the sequel.",Sin City
5302266,B004SIPA0A, A228NBNLYJ8V3J,4.0," ""Get over it, she needs you""","The title of this review, which is an excerpt from the John Hartigan story, embodies its essence; somebody is in need, and somebody else that cares will do whatever he can to help.<br /><br />There's little doubt that Bruce Willis owns Sin City. In his most memorable, most powerful and possibly best performance to date, Willis portrays the character of John Hartigan, a near retirement cop that has one final mission to accomplish. This is probably his most important mission that will define him for better or worse and would change his life forever.<br /><br />John Hartigan and Nancy Callahan's story is the most moving out of three sub-stories that incorporate Sin City. The other two, led by Mickey Rourke and Clive Owen respectively, are quite interesting and more graphic, though their violence is relatively easy to take thanks to the results of the CGI special effects that are used whenever blood is supposed to be present and thus giving the film a somewhat surreal feeling.<br /><br />All in all, it's a wild ride that passes too soon leaving  the viewer anticipating the upcoming sequels.",Sin City
5302267,B004SIPA0A, AHTIA3S8T0FMQ,5.0, An incredible translation of comic to film,"There are, as of this writing, 363 reviews of Sin City at Amazon.com. Frankly, I find it difficult to say anything that hasn't already been said. I have long been a fan of the Sin City comics and so I'm delighted with the movie. No other film based on ANY comic has so accurately been brought to life. I was entranced. Yes, it's violent. And dark. And graphic. Well, duh. It's called ""SIN CITY"" for a reason. If you're a fan of the comics, you will love this movie. If not, you probably won't. It really is that simple. My only complaint about this film is shallow. Really shallow. Be warned.<br /><br />Jessica Alba plays a stripper in danger who is repeatedly saved by a cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis). This is my complaint: strippers take off their clothes. She doesn't. Told you I'm shallow. But, still. Given the incredibly faithful adaption of the rest of the comic to film, this one ommission was glaring. Actors and Actresses take note: if you have a ""no-nudity"" clause in your contract, you are probably not the correct person to portray a stripper.<br /><br />That aside, this was an extrordinary film and I'll definately watch it again.",Sin City
5302268,B004SIPA0A, A3JEL0GP19ZI2Z,5.0, Outstanding!,"I enjoyed Sin City in the movie theater.  It has excellent performances by a multitude of stars and accurately captures the style and substance of Frank Miller's ""graphic novels.""<br /><br />Yes, it is a ""film noir"" in the extreme and full of gore and violence.  But if you watch it as it is intended -- a larger than life cartoon portrayal -- I think you will enjoy it.<br /><br />I watched the movie again in DVD when it was first released and enjoyed it even more on the second watching as I ""got"" more of the story line the second time around.  Still the original release DVD disappointed due to its lack of special features.<br /><br />The Recut, Extended, Unrated edition more than makes up for the disappointing originial DVD release.  Perhaps most impressive is the presentation of the separate tales in separate segments as they were told in the original Miller works.  This allows each to stand on its own and the addition of more and clarifying footage.  One sees how each story relates to the others in a different way than in the theater version in which the separate stories are intertwined througout the feature.<br /><br />The commentary by directors Rodriguez and Miller is excellent are all the other special features.<br /><br />If you haven't already bought the original DVD, skip it and buy this version.  You won't regret it, especially if you are a fan of the genre.",Sin City
5302269,B004SIPA0A, AM71STVDHO48S,5.0, BEST Comic Book Movie EVER!,"After I first saw ""Sin City"" I was astonished at how amazing it was. This is not a movie based upon the Frank Miller comic; this is Frank Miller's comic itself. The film breaths, speaks and looks just like the comic's very people and locations; whole scenes are exactly as they appear in Miller's book. Simply astounding! Furthermore, the special effects (most of the movie was filmed against a green screen) are seamless and create a look in the film that is absolutely beautiful. I also love the fact that Robert Rodriquez insisted that Frank Miller work as a co-director in the movie (along with Quentin Tarantino) much to the chagrin of the director's guild. The result is that the film retains all the richness of Miller's vision and style (unlike movies that promise a faithfulness to a particular author but in reality never deliver the proverbial goods-""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" by Francis Coppola comes to mind-what a piece of crap!).<br /><br />My only caution is that if this is a movie you want to purchase for your child; don't. This is not a film for children-""Sin City"" is definitely for mature audiences only. At any rate, along with ""Batman Begins"" ""Sin City"" is the best comic book movie I've ever seen. This is not an overstatement or exaggeration. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Caesar gives two enthusiastic thumbs up!",Sin City
5302270,B004SIPA0A, AK7CAW3N1XZV6,3.0, Hours of entertainment via a violence-packed action feature and loads of DVD extras,"First of all, I should say up front that Sin City is not the kind of movie that I would generally choose-I'm not a reader of comic books (or, as they now seem to be called, graphic novels), and although I do enjoy the action genre at times, I'm not a big fan of relentless, unnecessary violence.  And Sin City just might be the most violent film I have ever seen, so much so as to be to the point of absurdity (although, given that this IS an adaptation of a graphic novel series after all, maybe that is appropriate).<br /><br />The movie is actually a compilation of several interconnected stories, chronicles which are told via frequent shifts amongst both characters and time.  The style and general feel of the movie is quite similar to another dark film, Pulp Fiction, although I found Sin City to be more violent and less funny.  The movie opens with a short sequence between a man and a woman, two characters who I still haven't been quite able to place within the context of the rest of the film.  The main stories each feature a chief character:  Bruce Willis as a cop nearing forced retirement but out to save a little girl, an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as an ex-con out for revenge, Clive Owen as a vigilante who goes after the wrong man, and finally, back to Bruce Willis still playing the hero eight years later.  Each principal keeps up a constant stream of narration throughout their segment; this helps to provide necessary background information but becomes annoying after awhile.  However, the cinematography shines, as the film is shot mostly in gritty black and white with occasional splashes of color.  The lack of color actually diminishes the impact of the violence somewhat given that blood generally appears in the film as white, not red.  Did I mention that the movie is violent?  If you are sensitive to fight scenes, frequent maimings, and (not to mention) several beheadings, this movie is NOT for you.<br /><br />If you are a fan of DVD extras, this set is replete with them; at times, I was more intrigued by these than the movie itself.  Disc 1 contains the extended theatrical release plus extras which focus on some of the film's special features, such as the cars, costumes, props, and make-up that went into the making of the movie.  The car segment was particularly interesting, as it shows how various classic cars were sought out to help give the Sin City its film noir feel.  Disc 2 includes some more unique extras, including a fascinating ""green-screen"" version of the film shown at high speed:  in less that 10 minutes, you can view the entire movie sans most of its props and background scenes.  This disc also features each of the stories told individually-as originally conceived by creator Frank Miller-rather than morphed together as in the theatrical release.  Finally, this deluxe set contains a complete Sin City graphic novel of The Hard Goodbye (the story which stars Mickey Rourke).<br /><br />While not exactly my cup of tea, this movie was undeniably entertaining, with the included extras definitely making the deluxe edition worthwhile.  From what I could tell, the film stayed very true to Frank Miller's original graphic novels (almost TOO true, as the dialogue had moments that were undeniably comical, but not in the good way), and so I'm sure Miller's fans will be thrilled with this big-screen adaptation.  If you thought that Pulp Fiction was too tame, this movie is likely to be right up your alley, but those who prefer their action films with less violence should seek entertainment elsewhere.",Sin City

Well, I'll tell you why. There are too many sheep out there who cant wait another few months to own the movie. Come on, you've waited years to have the movie made.

Go Figure. >>><br /><br />Frank Miller is a favourite of mine, so I am pretty biased. The books the film is based upon cannot in the strictest term be called 'comics'. But this is heaped into the category of 'comic book film'. And you know what, for some reason that doesn't bother me.<br /><br />Miller, who has always been known for shaking up our perceptions on the definitions of what can be expected in the comic book medium, stuck gold with this solid serialized title. With this film, director Robert Rodriguez redefined what a comic movie could be. And with this version of the BD, they both have redefined the comic book home experience.<br /><br />Packed with featurettes, a sharp 5.1 soundtrack, snarky and witty commentary, and some 20 minutes of additional movie, there's not much to not like about Sin City at all. Hell, Rodriguez even puts a favourite recipe (apparently one that helped him get through the filming process) in the mix, a simple breakfast taco with homemade attentions- and I tried it; it is a simply divine way to spice up an early morning. How many other BDs, let alone DVDs, give you THAT kind of bonus features?<br /><br />We know the count. Sin City was a highly regarded ""neo-noir"" TPB series and a highly praised film. Awards, all-star ensemble cast, lots of action, strong and sexy women, lots of action, gore, and lots of action. Frankly, if you are a fan of gritty comics at all and have no knowledge of Sin City and do not own a BD player... well, there's a good suggestion for your first two purchases.<br /><br />It's dark, twisted, violent, and quite possibly one of my favourite films of all time.",Sin City

5302274,B004SIPA0A, A1MV5RJTPCUAEO,5.0, Modern American Monomyth,"According to ""The American Monomyth"" by Jewett and Lawrence (1988), the American monomyth is an ""an archetypal plot pattern emerging in which a community threatened by evil is redeemed through superheroism."" The monomyth is summarized as ""vigilantism without lawlessness, sexual repression without resultant perversion and moral infallibility without the use of intellect."" The three heroes, portrayed by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke, are far from saints, but each resolves to reap justice from the moral wasteland called Sin City. Character development is simple. Males are psycho-killers with a soft-heart for beautiful women; women are cover-girl prostitutes with guns. Bad guys are the psychotic rapists with a penchant for dismemberment. Rourke, Owen and Willis must break all rules to save a woman whose main endearing attribute is that they were once nice to them.<br /><br />This is truly a comic book come to life. Darker and more gruesome than any predecessor, Sin City also more closely adheres to the comic book feel than its brethren. Unlike, say the Hulk, where the cartoonish animated comic book hero seems out of place among real landscapes and real people, in Sin City, everything is equally stylized so that nothing seems too real or too cartoonish. Cars jump hills, men take bullets in the shoulder, characters move in an impossible ways.<br /><br />In Sin City, there is no ultimate truth or final solution. Each hero undergoes a personal battle against inner demons and outer fiends. You don't feel like the city is a place you've been and the characters are not people you ever think you'll meet, but they are real and three dimensional. Sin City is simply the heroic tales of three super-powered psycho-killers saving three smoking-hot dames in distress. Vigilante cowboy motif set in a modern wild west that is more sexy and less forgiving. How American is that?",Sin City

5302279,B004SIPA0A, A3PBXGRBO4POFS,4.0, In defense of Ultra-noir,"First, I'll start by responding to the review below referring to this film as a debasement of modern society. The film's obvious lack of realism hardly constitutes a true ""snuff"" film. Albeit there's lots of death, mayhem, cannibalism, scrotum-snatching, people-perforating and so forth, it's nowhere nearly as horrific as the less frequent but far more chilling death sequences of say ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the like. This movie laughs at death, as it should. The characters are surrounded by constant danger, live in a dark gritty, sans technicolor universe that's both horribly unforgiving, vengeful, sadistic, and just plain hell bent on their bullet/sword-induced demise. Despite all that death, they manage to smirk and make snide comments. I for one just love that. One can moan and complain about the sequences of death in this film, yet never mention once the countless CGI lives that were lost in the medievil battle on the fields of Pelenor. Both men and horses were impaled stomped on tossed and kicked about by the hulking feet of the Heradrim/Oliphant hoards. A man was slowly engulfed by gigantic bloodworms in the valley of Skull Island. Maximus Desmus Meridius killed many gladiators to survive servitude in the name of entertainment. The list goes on and on and on. The point is that without death, without mayhem, without the horrid underbelly of man's gruesome intent upon his fellow man, the element of danger is gone, and the audience ceases to care. In ""Sin City"", the characters were obviously in grave danger, every sequence was a tick closer to someone's death, creating a hellish gray-scale world of tortuous villains, a cannibalistic sociopath, Amazon Hookers, crooked cops and other assorted ubersadists we would only meet in a dark alley in our worst nightmares. The film was so visually astounding that the look alone was entertaining. The narrative was just as dark and haunting as the high contrast shadows and ominous unseen light sources. Robert Rodriguez's possible cult classic spews violent eye candy, and at the same time  throws in some of the most demented comic-noir ever to be seen on film. I wasn't shocked by the violence, as years of video games and other violent movies slowly developed a thick callous, but I was immensely entertained by this story set in the Urban equivalent of Dante's grim account. The movie's moral anchorage is as grey-scaled as its backdrop. The protagonists use brutish violence to exact vengeance, but are also murderers themselves. This obvious ambiguity of the film is also what makes it so alluring. The good guys act like bad guys, and the bad guys act like pure unadulterated evil incarnate. Everything about this movie works, even the things you'd normally think cannot. Its purified escapist charm spills out all over the screen with beautifully placed yellows reds and pale cool colors set against a sea of cold steely greys blacks and whites. Never have I ever seen a film that looks so awesome, and with the exception of the impending sequel, I don't suppose I will for quite some time.",Sin City
5302280,B004SIPA0A, A1534MBU6VJXYN,5.0," The ""Pulp Fiction"" Of Comic Book Movies","""Sin City"", Robert Rodriguez's ""translation"" of Frank Miller's classic graphic novel series, is not a film for everyone. It's the type of film you either love or hate, no in between.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is, in more ways than one, like ""Pulp Fiction"". Both films have oodles of violence, a large ensemble cast (even ""PF'S own Bruce Willis has a role), and even Quentin Tarrentino himself directs a sequence. ""Sin City"" also uses ""Pulp Fiction's"" method of combining several different stories into one movie.<br /><br />The first story deals with grizzled veteran cop detective Hartigan (Willis), who is searching for little Nancy Callahan, an 11 year old girl who has been kidnapped by the sadistic son (Nick Stahl) of a corrupt senator (Powers Boothe). Hartigan manages to save little Nancy, but when his partner Bob (Michael Madsen) seemingly turns the table, it looks as if Hartigan is done for.<br /><br />The next story focuses on Marv (Mickey Rourke). Marv is a hardened ex con trying to go straight with the help of his parole officer Lucille (Carla Cugino). One night, he meets Goldie (Jaime King). Marv sees in Goldie the woman he always wanted, one who loves and understands him. However, that night, Goldie is murdered in Marv's bed. This was done naturally to frame Marv. Determined to clear his name, Marv is led through a wild maze to find who killed Goldie, seeking the help of her twin sister Wendy (King). He is led to Kevin (Elijah Wood in a role that will make you forget that this is the same guy who played Frodo), a sadistic cannibal who preys on prostitutes. He manages to defeat Kevin, but in order to protect the ones he loves, Marv is forced to turn himself in and give up his life.<br /><br />The next story deals with Dwight (Clive Owen), who has recently hooked up with hyperactive barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy). When Shellie's ex boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) pays a little visit and roughs Shellie up, Dwight seeks revenge. He is led to Oldtown, where he runs into Gail (Rosario Dawson), an old flame and leader of a brigade of prostitutes. A shootout between the cops, Jackie Boy and his gang means a war between the cops and the mob in Oldtown. Determined to stop it before it happens, Dwight drives the bodies out to an abandoned tar pit. However, before he gets there, local crime boss Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) gets wind of this, and sends his men out to kill him. He is rescued by Miho (Devon Aoki), a prostitute who is also an amazing fighter. This concludes in a bloody shootout between the mob and the prostitutes, and makes for a truly exciting sequence.<br /><br />The fourth and final sequence ties in with the first chapter. Eight years after rescuing little Nancy (here played by Jessica Alba), Hartigan, who still keeps in touch of her, has decided to start his life over. But he soon learns that Roark's son, whom he thought he killed, has resurfaced, and is out to finish the job. He catches up with Nancy and is intent on saving her. This leads to a bang up finale between Willis and Stahl, and results in a chilling ending that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />To put in simple terms, ""Sin City"" is an excellent movie. It is one of the greatest comic book films ever created, and both the storyline and special effects work extremely well. This two disc special edition is loaded with bonus features and is a dvd that belongs in your collection.",Sin City
5302281,B004SIPA0A, AX8LSR4H6EBRJ,4.0, Two hours of my life well-spent!,"I really have to thank a friend of mine for getting me in on the Sin City scene, after loaning me the first installment of the comic series, 'The Hard Goodbye', I was hooked and immediately wanted to see the movie.  Fortunately, he had the DVD, borrowed it to me, and I sat down for the ride of a lifetime.  From the opening scene the film is arresting and hypnotic, the imagery used by Rodriguez in bringing Frank Miller's 2-dimensional comic into a 3-dimensional realm is absolutely perfect, especially crediting the select moments in which the film was translated into a streaming animated comic-like appearance.<br /><br />The opening scene already features two very accomplished actors, Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, and was shot even before the actual film was greenlit.  This scene was shot without Frank Miller's concent in order to persuade him into allowing a full-length feature to be made, and thankfully it was a success.  The finished product was something that I believe comic fans and movie-goers alike will find mind-bogglingly stunning for years to come.  But they won't have just this film to chew on, Sin City 2 has already moved into pre-production for a release date sometime in 2006, while yet a third installment is to follow in 2008.<br /><br />Sin City focuses on the tales of three separate people, dealing with their own problems on the filthy streets and back alleys of Basin City, where crime is the law, violence a sport, and murder a means of survival.  The first full story centering around Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking volatile Spawn-like figure goes on a murderous rampage to avenge the death of the only true friend and lover he ever had.  The violence is prominent, and the Kill Bill-stylishness of it all just makes you want to go back and watch it all again.  The second story follows a calm but insane and mysterious nightowl by the name of Dwight, as portrayed by Clive Owen.  Out of all the characters in this translation, he played the role with such ingenuity and twistedness.  This guy doesn't take crap from anybody, especially the two-timing infectious smug hot-headed cretens who get their kicks off of smacking women around and treating them like their own personal playthings.  The third and final tale (which begins before Marv's story and is continued after Dwight's) introduces us to Detective Hartigan, a good cop with a bad attitude and a real problem with authority, and on top of that, a heart condition.  But that doesn't stop him as he sets out to protect 19-year-old Nancy Callahan from the twisted clutches of Senator Roark's pedophile son, who has now become a disgusting, stinking yellow pervert.<br /><br />Be warned, parents.  Sin City is very violent, so this isn't a movie you should be taking your kids to.  While some of the content is implied rather than over the top and in your face, it still does go, well, over the top, which is why the adult audience will get more out of it.  Hollywood is becoming quite overrun with tame PG-13 action films all centering around some low-rent deadbeat who loses his family and has to quote un quote ""make them pay"".  I won't lie to you by telling you the concept of revenge isn't beneath the surface of this film, but what I will tell you is this isn't just high-flying martial arts kick-to-the-face action with little blood and no pain to teach a lesson.  This is raw, bloody and extremely violent.  The bad guys are always getting limbs severed, ears shot off, hatchets to the nuts, what have you.  This movie is far from tame and it's far from PG-13.  I will say that some of the action is somewhat exaggerated, but that's the entire point.  You have to let yourself go with the flow and enjoy the comic-to-screen dynamics which are put forth here.  The dialogue, action, angles, shots, even atmosphere are all captured exacting to Frank Miller's original comic series, which is what most film adaptations are missing these days.  It just isn't bound by the laws most action films are, it really lets go and takes you on one heck of a wild ride.<br /><br />As if the main characters weren't enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, there is an enormous all-star support cast featuring Jaime King as Marv's lover, the mysterious and hypnotic Goldie, Nick Stahl as the twisted Yellow B@st@rd, and let's not forget Elijah Wood as the cat-like cannibal martial-artist Kevin.  I'd just like to take a moment to point out that while Wood didn't exactly match the appearance of Kevin from the comic (i.e. in the comic he was taller, not as clean-shaven, etc.), he was still just damn cool to watch.  Now that I see him on screen and playing this character, it's hard to think anyone else could fill the spot, he did a flat-out awesome job in bringing the character to life, and this is a role that I will always know and respect him for.<br /><br />Other supporting actors feature Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Benicio Del Toro, and Devon Aoki.  Even most of the smaller roles are portrayed by relatively known people.  I don't know if I've ever heard of another film that had as many accomplished actors as this one, and it just goes to show you how much of a fan base this kind of film really has, and how it continues to draw fans from around the world.  I know I'm one of them.  Fan of the comic or not, if you like murder, revenge, blood, violence, action, and dark humor, this is your kind of movie.",Sin City
