B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"(The review below is what I wrote after seeing the film for the first time.  Since then, I've seen it again and I have to say...it plays better a second time.  I think 20 years of anticipation really stokes up the expectations so high that no film can live up to it.  And this one didn't, at first.  Having already seen it once, I have to say that I could sit back and really enjoy it better the second time.  Weird).<br /><br />I'm sure opinions are going to be all over the place for this movie--it made over $300 million worldwide its first weekend so obviously a lot of people saw it!<br /><br />I saw it with a midnight movie crowd the night before it was supposed to open and most of the crowd were high school kids and two guys dressed as Indy.  There was no applause at the end and everyone shuffled out.<br /><br />Something seemed missing.<br /><br />They certainly threw enough onto the screen.  The opening sequence in Nevada set a good pace as a team of Soviet spies use a kidnapped Indy to storm Area 51 and retrieve an other-worldly artifact from the warehouse we last saw at the end of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK.  The shot of Indiana Jones' silhouette walking up a hill as an atomic mushroom cloud fills the desert sky shows us the world has certainly changed since our hero battled Nazis all over the world.<br /><br />But the fun energy of the first film was missing.  It just wasn't fun after that.  And I don't mean that the filmmakers should've gone for cheap laughs or even ridiculous camp...but that spontaneous thrill from RAIDERS was gone.  It was never in TEMPLE OF DOOM and there were flashes in LAST CRUSADE.<br /><br />Although the whole extraterrestial angle was new and different, there were too many elements too closely tied to the earlier films.  There's no getting away from lost cities in jungles because, well, this is an Indiana Jones movie, but the finale felt like a rehash of RAIDERS.  The Ark of the Covenant was sufficiently explained so everyone could follow that ending.  But this time?  I'm guessing I know what happened and why, but did anyone lose count of how many crystal skulls were in play here?  The Russians nabbed one in Nevada and Indy got one in South America...but there was only one missing from the El Dorado temple, right?<br /><br />I also didn't care for the young guy character, Mutt.  He didn't look like James Dean or Marlon Brando, he looked like Screech from ""Saved by the Bell"" dressed up like Marlon Brando.  And his instant transformation from 50s punk to vine-swinging Tarzan nearly derailed the whole movie (I suspect that terrible CGI shot of him swinging with the CGI monkeys was only included in the latest round of ads is meant to take the sting of incredulous laughs from otherwise unsuspecting moviegoers).<br /><br />Very cool to see Karen Allen back.  (Now if we can only find out what happened to her character in ANIMAL HOUSE....)<br /><br />I remember reading how Spielberg assured everyone that the action wouldn't rely on computer special effects...but it looked like a LOT of computer special effects were used anyway, a real momentum killer for me anymore.  Most of the thrill of stuntwork was always the stunned belief that SOMEONE REALLY JUST DID THAT!  Until computers can trick us better, it's going to be hard to get us as excited as we used to be in movies.<br /><br />Some of the special effects shots were great though.  Since it's Spielberg and Lucas, you know you're seeing the best that money can buy.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't as bitterly disappointed as a lot of people were but I wasn't as excited and blown away as I was when I saw RAIDERS in the summer of 1981.  We were all a lot younger then.  And I can't blame this new production for trying.<br /><br />I'd rank them this way: TEMPLE OF DOOM was the worst, hands down.  Then this one.  Then LAST CRUSADE.  And still way out ahead, safely sitting way up on top is RAIDERS."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"No matter what you believe on this topic, this film is worth seeing if for no other reason to see the extradordinary lengths the ""scientific community"" will go to to dismiss anyone even daring to ponder that evolution doesn't completely explain everything surrounding the question of how humanity came to be.<br /><br />If you don't believe in God, or any creator from alien intelligence to the ""Great Spaghetti Monster,"" the fact is it's not an unrealistic proposition to suggest that evolution doesn't adequately address how structures as mind-bogglingly complex and elegant as the human eye simply ""developed"" over time.<br /><br />Even if you only want to dismiss intelligent design as the raving of idiots, it's worth a viewing."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"""Insanity"" is the perfect name for this DVD program.  Why?  Because you have to be at least a little bit insane to jump into a program such as this one.  The program is split up into two months of intense cardio and plyometrics with a bit of strength training thrown in (you use your body, not weights).  There is also a recovery week in which you'll find yourself doing a lot of stretching, a couple of yoga moves, and plenty of balancing moves.  Each DVD includes at least one workout on it (a couple feature two).  One DVD focuses strictly on the abs, although the abs get a great workout no matter which DVD you are on.  Also included is a workout calendar that lists which DVD to do on each day of the week.  Sundays are reserved for resting.  The DVD set I purchased also came with a recipe book and a meal plan.  All of these items were simple to use.<br /><br />The first month is very intense, with each workout ranging from thirty five to forty five minutes on average.  The second month is brutal, pure and simple.  The workout length extends to fifty five minutes on some of the DVDs during the second month.<br /><br />If you are not used to working out, or even if you consider yourself to be in decent shape, the warm-ups will kill you right away.  Do not be discouraged by this.  If you stick to it, you will improve.  Just three days into the program, I found myself lasting longer and longer before having to sit out or take a brief break.  After just a couple of days, I noticed that my arms were already beginning to show signs of tone.  My legs looked even better.  After two weeks, I started losing inches around my waist.<br /><br />Every two weeks, you have to take a fit test.  My first one was terrible, but the second fit test showed me doubling my performance on all but one (globe jumps) of the tests.  Each time after that, my results kept improving.  Granted, I didn't double anything afterthat, but you'd be surprised how tough it is to add just two or three more reps of a particular move.<br /><br />The second month really kicked my body into overdrive.  I was doing moves that I would never have dreamed of doing just a few weeks before.  The intensity level of the second month is off the charts.  Do not be ashamed to stop and take a breather while exercising, you'll need it!<br /><br />Shaun T is a very positive influence throughout the DVDs.  He'll go over each move before asking you to do it and highlights people doing each move properly and/or improperly so that you can learn proper form.  If someone's leg needs to be straightened out on the DVD, Shaun helps them achieve correct form.  This helps you at home maintain proper form as well.<br /><br />It is not unusual to see members of the workout group on the DVD simply step out of certain exercises from fatigue.  Shaun motivates them (and you) to return back to the workout as soon as safely possible.<br /><br />What it ultimately boils down to is how much you put into the program.  If you're serious about getting in shape, losing weight, or building endurance, you can definitely achieve all of these with ""Insanity.""  I personally lost sixteen total pounds and dropped to the tow holes on my belt.  My pants fit looser as do my shirts.  I feel a lot better than I've ever felt in a long time.  Not to brag, but my arms and shoulders are cut now and my legs actually gained a lot of muscle.  My abs feel tight as well, but I still have a little fat to get rid of before I can see that six pack I'm working on.  Even with the fat that is remaining on my belly, I can already see a bit of definition in my abdominable area.<br /><br />After a very short break, I plan on starting the program all over again.  Stick with it, and you can become just as insane as the rest of us!  Highly recommended."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	After watching the movie on HBO I had to purchase the book.  I couldn't wait until John Adams came out on DVD. One of my favorite things about the movie is the music, so I was thrilled that the soundtrack was made available as well.  I highly recommend this series. Paul Giamatti deserves an award for his portrayal of John Adams; I was really impressed with him!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Absolutely love.  Greatest laugh I had in a long time.  Walter and Peanut are lovable characters.  Jeff is funny and really brings his characters to life.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I had tears in my eyes, I was laughing so hard!  Absolutely great to have around the house as something to watch with others.  And, they even have it so you can do the ""bleeped"" version, should there be kids around."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5LEXS"">Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself</a><br /><br />This dvd is hilarious. I have ordered over 10 of them and given them away for gifts.  Great Gift for someone who needs a good giggle :)"
B000H7I6CU	1.0	b	I'm afraid to say that I simply hated this movie.  It was boring, slow, and the story sucks.  Pixar has really been failing recently, including Finding Nemo, Incredibles, and then this.  If anybody wants to see a good animated movie, go see Over The Hedge.  I give that 5 stars, as it is the best animated movie I've ever seen.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	When I saw this in the theaters, I remember thinking about halfway through that I was surprised to have let my concentration kind of dwindle away. The first hour of the film was entertaining (I thought the nuclear fridge escape was pretty awesome in a cheeseball sort of way) but halfway through it just gets kinda boring. There's a great fight scene with Indy and a Commie (forgive me) stooge going at it while surrounded by an army of vicious, fist sized ants. Any fight scene where the punches sound like gunshots is always entertaining to me. And let's give credit where credit is due, Harrison Ford is the man. Even though no other guy his age could take the drubbing that he does in this film, its still enough to bring a tear to your eye and a whip to your heart to see Indy back again doing what he does best, even if its in a movie that almost yawns itself to sleep.<br /><br />While watching the extras, I noticed something interesting. Spielberg kept talking about how he didn't want to make the movie. Or at least going in that direction without actually admitting it. And I think that's the secret. Personally, I think Spielberg made a half-hearted Indy film. The prospect of casting new wunderkind Shia LeBouf probably piqued his interest a little and reuniting Karen Allen with Harrison Ford again probably did it for him just as much, if not more so. But in the end, the movie felt a little lazy to me. And even though all of the Indy movies require some serious suspension of disbelief, this one requires you to basically check your brain in at the door because some of the things that happen are just flat out ridiculous. The whole vine swinging thing? Awful.<br /><br />The DVD is just what you'd expect. The picture and sound are pretty decent and the extras are a good amount and well put together but for me, not particularly interesting. I normally eat this stuff up but I think the fight was taken out of me at some point. If you loved the movie, you'll appreciate the extras but for me, I can do without watching them ever again. As for the movie itself, let's just say Temple of Doom is NOT the worst of the series.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	This is a complex film - It explores the Irish Mafia in Boston and the Irish in the Police. The good guy is Billy Costigan played by Leonardo di Caprio. Here he is driven almost insane by his role as an undercover cop - mental survival is his big challenge. The baddie is Colin Sullivan played by Matt Damon - He goes from success to success in the Police supplying his mentor/godfather and with inside information. The godfather in this case is Frank Costello - played by Jack Nicholson, perhaps over-played is a better description of his swagger and insanity.<br /><br />Damon is only mediocre in the role, di Caprio is great but the great player for me is Mark Whalberg as Seargent Dignam he is such a star in his minor supporting role. Whalberg is a highlight.<br /><br />Another great highlight is the very creative and inspiring sound track especially with Van Morisson singing the great Pink Floyd classic Comfortably Numb - Amazing.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This DVD kept us laughing all the way through!  May be inappropriate for younger children - some language and suggestive material.  But great for adults with a 'different' sense of humor!  We love Jeff Dunham!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I LOVE JEFF DUNHAM!  HIS TALENT IS AMAZING, AND HIS FRIENDS ARE JUST AWESOME!  THIS IS A MOVIE THAT I CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER, AND IT GETS BETTER EVERY TIME!
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	A different spin on the whole princess happily ever after thing.  The huntsman, not the prince breaks the spell?  Could have had a better cast. Special effects were alright.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I have a PS3 for Blue Rays to go along with a Sony Bravia 52 inch LCD W Series TV along with new surround sound speakers.. also a 7 in 1 Sony Receiver I bought on here,, sooo sound and pic are unreal... and for the price.. excellant..
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	At first I didn't know what to expect just because it was an oscar winner didn't necessary mean it would be good or appeal to my tastes - well it was excellent and what an ending, this has it all the love interest, backstabbing, murder, lies, everybody playing everybody - I don't think there has been a crime film this good since HEAT, can't wait for the sequel.
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	"Okay, I was probably the only one in the theater laughing my head off at the preposterous ""the night was hot and sticky like my heart"" writing, but give me a break!  Yes, new cinematic ground has been broken with the B&W visuals and dramatic angles, and Rodriguez wanted to be faithful to every inch of the comic, but only a fifteen-year old Goth kid could appreciate<br /><br />such ludicrously overheated dialogue! But aside from the insults to audience intelligence, the last Willis segment should have been cut down, and the violence just makes you numb after a while. How many severed heads does one movie need? I guess kids who play ""Grand Theft Rapist"" or whatever won't bat an eye, but it makes you yearn for the days when directors like Hitchcock would leave it to the viewer's imagination, while the characters talked like they at least attempted community college. Anyway, I still get the giggles remembering Mickey Rourke's straining face as he gets it on with his hooker/saint/whatever girlfriend..."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Loved this one. It was better than my favorite, the 1st installment. Dark, great acting, very emotional. I watched the rental on my pc - great quality, no complaints.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is a wonderful movie!  Every couple should see this one whether you have a great relationship or a not so great relationship.  It gives hope to marriages, families and faith in our society.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	If this movie goes down in price, definitely get it on Blu-Ray. On a regular DVD you'll probably just see better detail and brighter colors. But on the Blu-Ray version I could make out textures on surfaces of the people/surroundings that I never saw before.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Keep a calendar on your wall and JUST DO IT. It does work. And dont get on the scale because the first 2 weeks your body will be making muscles and those muscles will burn off that fliggin fat. GREAT VIDEOS! Dont look at the time, dont think just do it.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This was a birthday present for our grandson who just turned 4.  He was delighted and thrilled to receive this.  He loves the Cars movie and toys.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is one of the best movies I've ever seen!  I can't think of any movie I'd rather watch with my wife.  Kirk Cameron hits it out of the park with this film.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	Product arrived in the order it was expected and in the condition promised.  Shipping and handling fees were high.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Of course by now, everyone knows what a fantastic movie Iron Man is.  It's even more enjoyable on blu-ray where every scene jumps out at you.  I only wish the 5.1 would have sounded a little crisper on my home theatre system, but it's a small thing to comment about.  To me, it's still the best Marvel movie and I loved Thor and X-Men First Class.  Something unique about Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal - he is Tony Stark.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	"The Coen brothers give us a cinematic bloodbath, but with a message- Old People don't like this sort of thing.  People just don't have manners anymore.  It used to be that when people killed people in movies, back in the good ol' days when old people were young, they got what was comin' to them.  Now we live in a messed up world where serial killers murder people with compressed air canisters, and they don't feel sorry for it.<br />The point of all this on-screen killing is for Old Man Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) to philosophize in barely decipherable mumblings how it's all gone down the toilet, and people weren't cruel to each other back in World War 2 and such.  Was his character even necessary?  He certainly didn't move the plot forward any.  I guess the film needed a conscience.<br />There are many similarities with this movie and Fargo.  Except Fargo was better, and won less Oscars.<br />""No Country.."" was not the ""best picture"" from that year, though very few Oscar winners ever are."
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"This latest chapter in the Indiana Jones saga has been a hard movie for me to review. I loved the movie, but it wasn't perfect. A lot of the problems others have hated about it, never bothered me. I want to write it a glorious review because it's Indy, I had fun, and this character means a lot to me. 1984's ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" was my introduction to the character and his world, and it was a childhood shaping experience for me. Saw it in the theater 10 times. It means a lot, and so did this movie. Indy's return. There are little creaks here and there, but I enjoyed the heck out of most of it. I've already written two other reviews for it elsewhere, but took a long time to do this one. Why?. For it to settle in and to really get my thoughts, since those other reviews I wrote seemed to be based in childhood nostalgia for me and could of been better. Again, this has been a tough movie for me to review.<br /><br />First and foremost, Indiana Jones is back after a 19 year absence from our silver screens. There is no doubt that it is a most welcome return, nor is there any doubt that Indy is still Indy, or that Harrison Ford can still deliver the goods. Plot-wise, it doesn't hold up as much. Indy tries to find a crystal skull before those pesky russians(headlined by Cate Blanchett, who is both good and channeling femme fatale Natasha from ""Rocky And Bullwinkle"")do, and so on and so on. It's really nothing new and, quite frankly, gets kinda confusing and bizarre as it goes along. Story and plot is not KOTCS's strongest suit. Along for the adventure is Marlon Brando wannabe Mutt(Shia LaBeauf), as well as Indy's former love, Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen).<br /><br />KOTCS is both steeped in warm nostalgia and a new world. It's Indy, looks like Indy, feels like Indy, but there is something different. Coming almost two decades later, that's to be expected. Director Steven Spielberg is still a master at directing summer popcorn fare, and he knows how to do a tight action scene(key being the motorcycle chase thru campus)like nobody else. Effects wise, there are some startling moments and some very CGI moments, but the CGI never distracted me from the movie like it did others. In fact, I thought it all looked really good. After a while, you do long for the good old days of the earlier Indy films, but it still worked for me. And Spielberg, well, there is still plenty of Spielberg magic left in the guy, and some of that is on display here.<br /><br />Harison Ford is 65. So what?. He doesn't look much older or different than he did 10 years ago, and he is in incredible shape. He's a man's man, and a man's hero, and he is more than up to snuff to put the fedora back on. He and the character are a bit older, but nothing much else has changed. He still hates snakes(in one of the film's funniest and most endearing moments), and he still has that spark. LaBeauf is not the 'Jar Jar Binks' of the movie. He is quite charming, actually, and more than holds his own. It was also great to see Karen Allen back, but I felt she was relegated to just 'one of the gang', and wasn't given all that she could of been given. Still, she did a fine job, and she looks incredible. Not much difference with her either.<br /><br />In the end, KOTCS is a fun movie. It's an entertaining movie. It's an Indiana Jones movie. Some of it is silly, some of it is exciting, and all of it is fun to watch from beginning to end. The story of the film is shaky, and as the film goes along, it gets even more wobbly. The climax to the plot is somewhat head scratching, and I am still torn by it. But the very, very end of the movie, the last scene, is fantastic. All in all, it was a nearly 20 year reunion in the making and, for the most part, it was most welcomed. Like any reunion with someone in some place you haven't been in decades, there are some awkward moments, but it's still a good experience and you are glad you went."
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	Movie had little plot. Other then special effects its a snooze, we kept waiting for it to get better. I think the main problem was they tried to make it so dark and not enchanting enough. Not a fan of Kristen Stewart
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	Too much Umbridge, not enough Harry.  Climactic scene in the Department of Mysteries relies too much on flash (exploding prophecies, falling shelving, etc) and not enough on head to head duel between Harry/Dumbledore and Voldemort.  This is easily the worst of the five movies.  Of course I will buy it but more to keep a complete set than for enjoyment.
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	At first I thought the problem was on my end but having read the last review I found that it is not. Amazon is having server troubles, possibly from too many people trying to watch Harry Potter. I have 48 hours to watch this movie but Amazon won't let me watch it.<br /><br />Amazon Customer Service: 1-866-216-1072<br /><br />Not that they'll help. They told me they aren't having any problems on their end.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I am sure the movie description written for the product is better than anything I could ever write, so I will just leave it as this is a good movie that I got a great deal on the Blu-Ray.<br />p.s.- I have watched this movie about 50-60 times with my daughter and it is still pretty funny.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Until X-Mas of this year i had never heard of Jeff Dunham. Now, I could watch this dvd everyday.  HE is funny and imaginative. I forget that he is using puppets. his 2nd dvd ""Spark of insanity"" is just as good."
B00447G29S	1.0	b	I went to see this last winter with some friends from college. I saw that Tom Hanks had a hand in making this flick. Normally I have been very pleased with his work, but this movie downright disappointed me! It had great special effects, but very little to do with the actual story.<br /><br />Every Christmas Eve, my mom reads the book to my sisters and me, and it seems the magic is still there. But this movie wasn't magical at all.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	"Never saw this in the theaters, so I waited to buy the blu-ray. Awesome movie and in highdef.<br /><br />The end of the movie is pretty much a ""no way in hell"" and some of the action scenes follow that same logic... but come on.. it's INDY and it's been 18yrs or so since the last movie when that was supposed to be the last crusade. This movie does have that feel of the old movies in it, which I was glad it did. It was nicely filmed and the plot was nicely done.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of Shia, and the crystal skull logic was a tad off.. The myth about the skulls wasn't about aliens and it being their actual heads, the real crystal skulls in the world are that of human shapes.<br /><br />But.. rumor has it an Indy 5 is coming and will be the actual final movie of the series. Just hope it has some of the nostalgia of the series as this one did."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Superb in every respect.  And so heartening to know it was a totally American production.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Our family loves Coen Brothers movies, and this film is among our favorites.  It's got everything -- great story, perfect casting, the always spot-on dialogue, and gorgeous cinematography.  We can't wait to see what the Coen Bros. come up with next!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I was excited to receive this product and it didn't disappoint. Great Price! MONEY WELL SPENT! Thanks. (=
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	The movie was great but when downloaded to watch it, it was not in full HD, it's more like regular dvd. The tech person I've hired says I have the latest and explained it just the way it was recieved. I rather buy the disc and/or watch it in non HD and save cost in the future.
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	"I received my copy from Amazon of HBO's series ""TRUE BLOOD"" a couple of days ago and have been on a marathon session viewing the disks.  I enjoyed the books and was elated to learn that the books had been translated to cable TV.<br />  I had no intention of writing a review.  I came here to read the reviews and to learn if I'd missed some perspective of the show; I didn't come here to get ticked off but that happened.<br />  Books are books, and all books are biased to charm a certain audience, mostly in order to charm money out of the pocket of the reader.  TV is TV, and ALL of TV -- cable and commercial -- is stilted, twisted, tilted, written and repeatedly rewritten, and then stretched beyond recognition from its original conception to (the writers, directors and producers think) appeal to a very wide audience, most of whom have the mentality of idiots with 8TH grade educations, hence the need for sensationalism, erotica, and far too much profanity.  TV has to have a draw, otherwise TV shows fail, and all those involved in the production lose money, money, money.<br />  Those considerations in mind, I'm not overly disappointed with the HBO series as each (book and TV) is a different entity with limitations and specialized commerical requirements (it's all about salability, babe), and those limitatins should be at the forefront in the mind of each consumer if that consumer wishes to make an objective evaluation.  However, I am severely disappointed by the various reviewers and their quirky attitudes.  Sorry, but I don't have time or the inclination to quote each reviewer and how/why I disagree with that particular reviewer.<br />  In as far as the written version of ""Sookie Stackhouse's"" travails go, I do prefer the books because the reader becomes involved and must use his/her imagination, something that seems to be in short supply with many people and explains a decided preference for TV viewing (most people have the attention span of a gherbil).  TV does not require the degree of involvement that reading requires, nor does TV require that the viewer be literate.<br />  As the saying goes, ""TV is a no brainer.""  So it seems.  And so it seems that many of the viewers and reviewers more than adequately qualify for the epithat, since all TV requires is that one sit back and watch. A very sedantary form of recreation and addictive.<br />  In praise of the books and the series, it is a bold new twist on vampire lore, which is the most prevailing reason to read the books and the watch the series . . . if either format is your cup of tea.  If neither format suits you, then you may be content to sit in a corner and twiddle your thumbs.<br />  As for the series, the acting (for the most part) was uninspired and tepid, and the continuity director was apparently absent from the set during filming.  The best acting, in my opinion, was provided by ""Vampire Bill"" and ""Vampire Eddie.""  It's odd that actors portraying  dead men (Vampires are regenerated dead, remember?)could evoke more sympathy and show more human compassion than their warm-blooded counterparts.<br />  Stephen Moyer, whom one reviewer panned as having an unconvincing Southern accent, does the best job with the role he signed to play and had the most consistent Southern accent, quite a remarkable and laudable accomplishment for a Brit. Thus far, Mr. Moyer appears to be the only true actor in a major role in this series, and the only actor not over the top.<br />  Many of the other characters had spotty accents.  ""Tara,"" for example, flucuated in her accent from an Oklahoma accent, to an Arkansas accent, both combined with a touch of a Southern Florida accent, while having no trace of a detectable Northern Louisiana accent.  Most disconcerting and confusing.  I don't know who the dialog coach was, but he/she does not deserve a raise and should have put in some overtime--for free.  Or be replaced.<br />  At first I didn't understand the reason for greater part of the air time being dedicated on ""Jason,"" ""Tara,"" and ""Lafayette,"" all fairly minor book characters but necessary devices to move the story forward -- in the books.  Apparently, these strange devices and the odd characterisations were the sensationalism for the cable TV series (hence all the gratuitous and vigorous ""sex"" and unnecessary nudity) and also because this was a direct way to translate the book character ""Sookie's"" thoughts, a means (and a mean device) to move the story forward without using voice-over.  Well, duh.<br />  Incidentally, since I'm on a roll, I understand that showing the many . . . uh, hmmm . . . libidinous encounters ""Jason"" had was a device to show his amoral nature and to provide the reason for suspecting him of committing a number of horrific crimes.  I'd like to point out that a display frequent, vigorous sex does not equal good sex, nor does it make one a good lover.  All it shows is that ""Jason"" and his many partners are  soulless, mindless, self-interested horn dogs.<br />  As for the atomsphere portrayed in ""TRUE BLOOD,"" I found it realistic to the point of making me itch at the sight and sound of the night insects. I could almost feel the heat and smothering humidity of the deep South and smell the bayou stench.<br />  Bottom line:  I have very mixed feelings about ""TRUE BLOOD,"" which I suppose could have been neatly condensed into that one line and saved some time.  But, I'm on my high horse now.<br />  Among my many mixed feelings, one is my intense dislike for how ""Sookie"" is portrayed in the series.  In the books, ""Sookie"" is strong, resorceful, honest, kind, loyal, steadfast, hardworking, and caring.  A gal with a conscience.  Someone who'd never bypass a person in need. A gal the reader could care for, dream with, and hope that all would go well for her. In the series, ""Sookie"" comes across as a hand-wringing dimwit, and she failed to show proper respect for her grandmother, ""Adele Stackhouse.""  The ""Sookie"" in ""TRUE BLOOD"" grotesquely failed to show any respect to town elders, something no correctly reared Southern girl would do.  Ever. Under any circumstances.  The ""Sookie"" in ""TRUE BLOOD"" also lacks the humor and tact of the gal in the books.<br />  I can only hope that the series improves.  Based on my slender hope, I'm willing to withhold any truly scathing remarks and wait for the second seaon with a prayer that the series does improve by leaps and bounds because it seriously needs some major overhauls.  If there is no improvement, the series is doomed.<br />  And this is more time than I could readily spare for this trivial project."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"So, as with all workout videos, I was skeptical - and after reading all the reviews, I was still skeptical.  I have a 1-year-old and was anxious to lose the extra baby weight (about 10 pounds) and get back into pre-preg shape (I am relatively athletic and hadn't felt so in like 2 years).  My husband and I started the program and signed up for myfitnesspal for the 'diet' portion (downloaded to our iphone/itouch) ... we have 2 days left of the program and I am thrilled/sad ... thrilled to see the results (back to pre-preg weight and toned! was 5'9"" 151lbs now 140lbs ... hubby 6'1"" 187lbs down from 218lbs)and sad that it is over - though I think we may start it again to see if it is any easier ... so it works and we can see the results in our before/after pictures and in our general level of fitness. We set up our basement with a tv and floormat and a pack-and-play for the days when we couldn't get up early enough to fit in the workout before the baby got up. I think eating the right calorie count is important ... we didn't really follow the diet plan with this video but def. changed our eating habits to be healthier. As far as knee pain (several others comment on this) - when we first started I def. felt pain in my knees and was suprised since i have played soccer since forever and never had issues ... but i was weraring running sneakers while working out and found out through some research that it could be my footwear bothering my knees ... I got a pair of crosstrainers after week one and tahdah! no more knee pain ... just go for it!"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This video has changed my life. I knew that there was a LOT going on with our foods, but to genetically engineer a soy bean so it could withstand spraying with ROUNDUP...made by a chemical company???? I am a RN and read studies daily with a site that I get on the net...and it makes sense WHY there has been a 400% increase in autism cases in the past few years now doesn't surprise me at all.<br />I watch every bite I eat more now and the SOURCE OF WHERE IT COMES FROM. I am fortunate to have never bought into the hydrogenated oil fad as any food that is good still sitting out days later worries me!<br />I live in an area that if finally organic and health food grocery conscious...FINALLY! It hasn't been always, but we did have some farmer's markets.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This has been an all time favorite movie in my family. It was great to add this DVD to our family collection. My 7 yr son just loves to watch it at any time.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	The product itself is very lean and simple, but the content is outstanding.  Jeff Dunham is clearly a new generation of comedians on the level of Robin Williams.<br /><br />Most outstanding and entertaining.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	M. Night Shyamalan has created another excellent film. Unfortunately, the geniuses in marketing screwed it up again.<br /><br />The hallmark of a film by Mr. Shyamalan is the slow yet deliberate pacing. He does a good job of telling a story about a society that is closely knit and forced to live within certain rules.<br /><br />He does a good job presenting both sides of the closed society; how and why it was created.<br /><br />I rate this very much worth owning, but warn would be purchasers  this film requires one to have patience and be willing to let the  story develop. Those who need instant gratification via explosions of blood and gore will be very disappointed.<br /><br />The acting is excellent in this film, and, oddly enough, the actors blend well with the setting.<br /><br />Finally, from a visual standpoint, there are shots in this film that are so beautifully framed, it moves the film from entertainment to visual art. In my mind, the visual art of filmaking has been pretty much ignored since Tim Burton made the Batman movies.<br /><br />I commend M. Night Shyamalan for creating this visual masterpiece to go with his excellent script.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"This DVD pack was amazing, it features some really ground breaking special features, like the green screen version of the whole movie and so on.<br /><br />The DVD set features 2, yes 2 versions of the movie and the complete ""hard goodbye"" comic book! The movie also has 2 commentaries featuring Frank miller, Bruce Willis and yes Quentin Tarantino himself!<br /><br />This is a really unique DVD box set that is a MUST for any DVD collection!!"
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Excellent 13 and older movie maybe confused with child movie. Great art put a whole new light on the movie. do not like to have twenty  word minimum.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This is a must watch documentary that will stop you choosing foods just based on price. I am not even tempted by fast food and this cements it for me.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This is one of my all time favorit movies.  Great for kids of all ages(1 to 99years old).  Purchased this one for a birthday gift for a 3 year old.  His mother says that he watched it so much that they put it up so he will enjoy it again for Christmas.  A wonderfull movie that will make everyone believe!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	This documentary is not about disproving evolution and it is not about proving the existence of God.  The documentary attempts to do neither thing.  Similarly, it is not accurate to suggest that Ben Stein is presenting a conspiracy theory.  Rather, this documentary is about the quashing of academic freedom.  It represents, and correctly so, that there is a scientific theory for which there are differences of opinion in the academic community, including well educated scientists from Ivy league schools, but due to the hostile climate regarding the theory, scientists are afraid to raise any question which could be deemed a challenge to the theory, and that those who point to unanswered questions regarding the theory,  are met with the termination of their jobs, rather than a professional open debate as to the potential answers to the question.  Anyone who lives in an allegedly freethinking society should find that disturbing, regardless of your opinion on the theory of evolution, and should disfavor the suppression of open debate. Contrary to the representation of other reviews, Ben Stein specifically states in the documentary that it cannot be said that all proponents of evolution are Nazis.  To put the comment in context, a scientist who was a proponent of evolution stated that evolution would disprove religion leaving only science in its place and would end all wars.  Ben Stein reminded his audience that science, like anything, can be abused by humans, as evidenced by Nazi's inappropriate use of science to murder those deemed inferior.  Any scientist or other person should favor the dissemination of all scientific information and the promotion of open debate, even if the debate involves a minority view to which the individual does not subscribe. It is not about the existence or inexistence of god, but the necessity of academic freedom for the furtherance of a freethinking modern society.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	This movie adaptation of J.K. Rowlings 5th book was unfortunately a let down for me.  You definitely needed to have read the book first  to understand what was going on in the movie.  Favorite scenes from the book were left out - Quiddich.  Favorite characters - Hagrid, Creature and Tonks had very minimal parts.  The movie is very dark in both cinematography and subject.  The characters all have a harder edge and definitely not a children's movie.  Imelda Staunton who was cast as the perfect Delores Umbridge literally steals the whole movie.  Harry, Hermoine and Ron all seem to be getting a little too old for the characters that they play.  The best part of the movie was the last 30 minutes, unfortunately you had to sit through the first two hours to get there.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"A fantastic film. Possibly better than Spider-Man 3 was, but will never beat Transformers. I enjoyed the part where Stark as Iron Man blows up that tank. But I really liked it when Iron Man and the Iron Monger went to battle. I also thought that when Tony was testing the Mark II armor and crashed and was sprayed with a fire extinquisher that made me laugh. My favorite quote was ""Shoot me again and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to community college"". So see the movie and get the DVD."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Doesn't get better than this. Blu-ray plus a great Harry potter movie. Even if you're not a fan nothing bad can be said.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	WOW! This is one of the best superheroes moives you will ever see. Action,Drama, and suspence make this moive a must see. Also order from Amozon, the shipping comes early.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	"I am warning you up front, this WILL contain ****SPOILER ALERTS**** and since I don't want to stop and type it in at every point, don't read my review if you don't want spoilers about this movie.<br /><br />First the bad: I looked at this movie through the eyes of one who isn't a fan of any of the people in it or directing it. I couldn't honestly give it 5 stars because the story between Snow and the Huntsman and Snow's One True Love was a bit clumsy and changing a beloved fairy tale was jumping the shark (IMHO). Putting the unnecessary scenes aside (the trip to the woman's only camp? Still in the dark on the why of that one), the walk through the fairy forest and then being attacked by the evil Queen's henchmen? I don't know, maybe I'm a hopeless hopeful, but it seems to me, the fairies would have warned them it was coming, but what do I know. The fact that the Great Snow pulled together her own army after being kissed NOT by her One True Love, but the Huntsman who I'm not sure we even know who he is anyway, even to the end, where he stands at the back of the ""church"" whilst Snow is crowned ends up in a big mess. The entire ending scene was a big question mark to me. Why was it all so slow and odd? The Seven Dwarves? I didn't get that either. There were other :-O throughout the movie, but I'm tired so I'll go on to the good.<br /><br />I think Charlize Theron was spectacular in her role as the evil queen. She scared me to death, that's for sure. I thought the cinematography was quite wonderful throughout the entire movie. I actually thought Kristen Stewart was quite good as Snow White. In fact, I can't fault any of the actors at all. It's the STORY that was the problem. The beautiful parts intertwining with the dark parts could have been done SO MUCH BETTER. Sometimes when you mess with a storyline that works, you don't end up with something better. Had the director stuck to the actual storyline we all know and love about Snow White, with the beautiful CGI and the amazing cast he had at his disposal, I think we would have seen a 5-star movie. I wanted so badly to give this 4 stars, but in the end, there were more questions than answers, it could have been a MUCH better movie given the looks of the amount of money these producers and the director had to spend on it.<br /><br />This movie should have been at LEAST a 4-star movie with the support it had in cast, money and CGI - and it's so disappointing that, to me, it was quite wasted. When will these Hollywood people learn that when our world is in so much turmoil, we want to be swept away with familiar entertainment, not some new twist we have to think about? They truly need to go out and hobnob amongst the unwashed masses and ask us what we WANT if they want to stop wasting money needlessly and start making lots and lots of money again? Considering a lot of us out here are without jobs, without the ability to pay our bills, we would LOVE to have the money wasted on this movie. The money would have been better spent just sending each jobless family a check in the mail. Sorry - just my opinion. And it's not one I want to have. I WANTED this movie to be great! Quite frankly, I am being generous giving it 3 stars. Because in my heart, that's how much I wanted this movie to be great."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This is a great show, after watching the first couple of episodes I didnt want to stop.  Great adaptation of the book.  The creaters have done a good job with the storyline from the book as well as making some changes.  If you like vampires and Alan Balls other series Six Feet Under you will love this show!!!
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	Product is excelent but at least the blue ray lacks other different languages than English. If you are expecting to see this movie in your mother language, like Spanish, don't buy it.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Really makes you think about how harmful convenience is. It also opens your eyes to the crazy that goes on in the world!
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	If you have ever been a fan of the Alien franchise, or Ridley Scott, you must watch this movie. Don't ask why, just watch. When you're done watching Prometheus, turn on Alien. It will Segway perfectly and leave you wanting more!
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	"Please be warned! This movie is NOT FOR CHILDREN! The PG-13 rating is no lie, here. There are images and themes in this movie that could easily give any sensitive adult nightmares. Here are some EXAMPLES of only a few of the scenes children would find deeply disturbing (as did I):  The evil queen tells her newly married husband, the king, of her hatred of men, who ""use women,"" just before she kills him on their honeymoon bed.  A few scenes later you watch as her brother kisses her shoulder as he and the queen hint at an incestuous relationship with each other. In order to preserve her beauty, the queen eats the hearts of an animal or bird of some sort, which you see cut open at her dinner table, as she digs the heart out and puts it in her mouth.  The queen pulls the heart out of one of her subjects after he attempts to assassinate her.  No child should ever be exposed to such horrors.  You can definitely cross this movie off your Christmas list!"
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	Well...let me first say....I am a fan of every actor in the movie.  I watched this for the fist time last night (dvd screener for the Oscars) I am glad I didnt have to buy it. It is just awful. I hate to say that...I really do. I thought it would ROCK!  Geee it was all I could  do to sit through it. Sorry  to all in the cast...but if I had paid to see it - I would have demanded my money back. I only gave it two stars (instead of 1) because I truly LOVE all the major actors in it (in their past movies)  --- crazy disappointed.
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	"I love Harry Potter, OK? So before you freak out, let me get that out of the way. The book version ""Order of the Phoenix"" was oustanding. I also think that previous directors have done pretty good to great jobs of translating the books to film (though I must say things went a little downhill once Chris Columbus left.)<br /><br />All that being said, here's the kicker:<br /><br />The movie ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" played like a Cliff's Notes adaptation of the book.<br /><br />It lopped off a lot of the charm and romance and heartfelt pathos of the book--- as well as a lot of the pure creative touches--- in order to get the main arc of the story down. On top of that, it made ""adaptations"" to the book in order to get the story moving along--- yet all these ""compromises"" were actually worse than what JK Rowling originally wrote!<br /><br />Don't believe me? Here is only SOME of what is wrong with this movie:<br /><br />--Poor devlopment of the Harry/Cho Chang arc (The kiss is about all you get. No real feeling behind it at all. No devlopement of Harry's crush. No final break up argument on Valentine's Day.)<br />--Making Cho into an evil snitch (which is why she and Harry broke up in the movie.) In the movie SHE is the one who betrays Harry. Stupid.<br />--No hospital scenes. No meeting of Neville's parents.<br />--Perfunctory explanation of Grimmaud Place<br />--Perfunctory development of Occlumency<br />--Harry gets to hear the prophecy while standing in the Department of Mysteries rather than later with Dumbledore. On top of this, he gets to hear the prophecy just by holding it in his hand. That makes no logical sense at all!<br />--The Department of Mysteries itself is compressed down into one room (the room with the prophecies.) All the cool rooms (with the blue lights, the 12 doors, the clocks, the brains, and so on) are all just ignored. Those were such tremendous inventions by JK Rowling--perhaps some of the most creative stuff in all the books-- that I can't believe they just cut them!<br />--The room with the arch is made into a really boring place.<br />--The battle scene is really short and rather stupid.<br />--Snape's memory of being tortured by James Potter and his argument with Lily Potter is compressed into literally a total of 4 seconds of film. That scence is so PIVOTAL to the rest of the book series that I can't believe they got away with not fully developing the scene.<br /><br />On top of all these plot issues, the WORST part about this movie is that there was really no FEELING in it. The whole range of emotional arcs that are so well-developed in the book are done absolutely terribly in the movie. Yeah, Sirius dies. In the book, it is a devatating moment. In the movie, it's like ""Oh, well."" Harry, Ron and Hermione don't have many moments together. There is no laughing in the movie. There are no lighthearted moments. Almost every scene except one or two that could have developed the emotional attachment we feel to the characters has been summarily excluded.<br /><br />Like one other reviewer said: The movie is too short, yet it feels too long.<br /><br />That is, sorry to say, a perfect description of a hack job.<br /><br />I am quite disappointed."
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	"In the beginning, I was thinking, ""This movie could have a better (musical) score,"" but in the end I was not disappointed. Great movie if you're interested in the evolution and telling of fairy tales or if you just want to spend a couple hours in enchantment. The ending left me in awe, wanting more but knowing that having it would ruin the effect. I just sat there watching and thinking about the movie afterward. Just wow. I highly recommend."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"The movie is about a marriage relationship which has been devastated due to selfishness, unkindness, and communication-breakdown on the part of both parties--and the resulting atrophy of heart these (very common) relationship-killers lead to. The movie holds out hope for the restoration of broken relationships and flies in the face of the current Hollywood-driven nonsense that the only way to true happiness is to ""follow your heart."" Statistics show that most folks follow their hearts right into the divorce courts.<br /><br />There is nothing more robust and intelligent than the Bible's insightful depiction of mankind--no one is exempt from its piercing review of human frailty. Fireproof gives us a look at how the Bible's powerful message of mercy, truth, and love--exemplified in the self-sacrificing example of Christ--can be applied to our ailing relationships, specifically marital relationships. And it is honest in its depiction that the journey may not be an easy one."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Awesome movie, great cast of characters. Martin Scorsese once again delivers which will always be one of the all time greats! Great twists & turns. Can't say enough about this movie, keeps you watching every second w/ getting bored for a minute. Long movie, but you would never realize it, goes almost too fast!
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	"I kept hearing about the movie ""Cars,"" but somehow I never got around to seeing it. Then lately, I stumbled upon the DVD and purchased it on the advice of my companion. We watched it a couple evenings later. It's an amusing and somewhat touching movie. Dumb, perhaps, but amusing.<br /><br />The story involves Lightning McQueen, an ambitious rookie racecar who unexpectedly finds himself marooned in the old Route 66 Arizona town of Radiator Springs. McQueen was on route to the big Piston Cup Championship in California where he was to compete against two pros with whom he'd tied in a previous race.<br /><br />In Radiator Springs, McQueen gets in trouble with the law and has to do community service repairing the street. As such, he gets to know Some of the town's characters. Sally, a 2002 Porsche, becomes his lady friend. Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet, gradually reveals he was a previous three-time Piston Cup winner. Mater, a beat up but trusty tow truck, helps him realize that there are other things just as important as racing. McQueen eventually goes on to compete in the Piston Cup, where he could have won.<br /><br />It's an amusing story, well told. There are chuckles here and there. The depictions of the cars and the setting of Radiator Springs are interesting. In places, the movie is touching. It'll probably pick up a few awards, but I wouldn't rank it with the best animations.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Again, I am a fan of Jeff Dunham and his characters.  He brings life to the puppets and makes you believe that there is more than one person on stage.  Jeff speaks the ""politically incorrect"" through the characters - What many would like to say but don't.  Great DVD for a good laugh."
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	End was dry but movie had some great features. Acting was well done to create characters, visuals were great I recommend HD or Blu-Ray. Totally left room for sequel....wonder what will come next???
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"I hesitated about seeing ""Prometheus"" (123 min.) in 3D, but when I heard that the movie was in fact shot specifically with 3D cameras, I gave in and went to see it today in a 3D theatre. I'm glad I did. The 3D visuals are pretty much outstanding throughout, set in razor-sharp perspective. So yes, it is worth the extra couiple of dollars to see this in 3D, at least in the theatre. I have no idea how well the 3D version will translate to your TV screen.<br /><br />As to the movie itself, while the story seemed a bit overly complicated at time, once the movie got rolling about 45 minutes into it, it was a non-stop riveting ride to the very end. At first I thought that Noomi ""Dragon Tattoo"" Rapace was miscast as Elizabeth Shaw, but I most surely changed my mind after seeing what she goes through in the second half of the movie, and in fact I think her performance stacks up well to Sigourney Weaver's. Michael Fassbender's performance as the human-like robot David is also worth mentioning.<br /><br />A special mention must be made about the movie's outstanding visuals. It really felt as rich as say ""Avatar"". As I was watching the movie, I couln't help but think to myself, ""this sure looks like one heck of an expensive movie"". Curiosity got the better of me so I looked it up, and indeed the production costs alone (never mind the marketing costs) are estimated at $125 million. Amazing. Even though the movie's ending is left fairly wide open with a clear path for a ""prequel-sequel"", I don't know that the studio will even greenlight it, unless ""Prometheus"" is a big hit (which is not likely; I wash shocked how poorly attended the huge theatre was that I saw this in). Bottom line, if you like a good science fiction movie set in space, regardless of whether you've seen ""Alien"", this is definitely worth checking out."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Bought this movie to watch on Christmas night. My son is 4 and he loved it. I can't wait for next Christmas when my daughter can get to watch it with the family (she's will be 2) provided she can keep her attention throughout the movie (which I doubt). It will be a nice Christmas tradition to start for our young family.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is a great comedy and keeps you laughing all the way to the end and Vote for Walter.<br />from. TH Indiana
B00447G29S	5.0	b	grandparents got this for the kids few years ago when it first came out, i hadn't heard of it and didnt know what to expect. we all loved it, the kids watched it a million times. When we got a blu ray player there were a few movies we already owned on dvd that i wanted to upgrade, this is one of them, it is a christmas time classic that we watch with hot cocoa every single year even as kids are getting older. But we also watch in summer time, good anytime of year even though basically a christmas movie this appeals to adults and kids alike, it is one of all time favorite movies.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	I feel completely hoodwinked by Amazon on this and will likely cease doing business with this company entirely.  I already have this classic film on standard DVD, but purchased this 3D version over numerous LOWER priced 3D options because of trailer footage on another 3D disc purchased.  It is a completely worthless piece of trash, complete with these cheesy red/blue glasses that are supposed to render a 3D effect.  I thought I was getting a genuine passive 3D premastering of the film that would add the additional quality on the trailer I saw.  For the $31 price tag I think this is not unreasonable.  Additionally, Amazon does not segregate the reviews posted to their site well, so you are reading reviews for other products in the view of your considered purchase.  This is the first criticism I have ever had of Amazon to be frank, but I am blisteringly angry at this two bit rip-off of a good customer and intend to show my anger by making NO future purchases until I receive some satisfaction on this matter.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"After seeing this video a year ago I decided to make it a permanent addition to my library. Other than the fireman occupation, this scenario hit so very close to home.  I too found myself in that terrible place with my wife 13 yrs ago. My outcome was not the restored marriage I prayed for and my ex went on to marry the guy that she was involved with.  But God brought me a woman that loves the Lord and now we have ""Fireproofed"" our marriage. This movie is a great help to begin the process to properly re-focus where your attention should be in any marriage- God and your spouse.  TV, Hollywood...the world, have been telling us quite the opposite. Pretty obvious they are wrong.<br /><br />Don't want your failing/failed marriage to be another statistic?  Begin to FIREPROOF it!"
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	The movie is just okay...but I would think that snow white should show way more emotion than she did...plus--where's the prince.  Total disappointment really.<br /><br />However costumes, sets were pretty good...
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	We just finished watching as a family. Not sure it was appropriate for a 5 year old, but nonetheless educational for all of us. Spread the word. The reviews sum it up nicely here. It was an amazing appetite suppressant, and I'm not sure what I am going to eat tomorrow. We have a limited selection where we live, and it was amazing to see how EVERYTHING was intertwined. I can't wait to share this video with friends and family.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I enjoyed watching the extended version of Snow White & The Huntsman. I loved the special effects and would watch the movie again just for that.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"This is a scifi thriller that moves at a fast pace then shifts into frenzied. This flick wastes no time getting into the thick of things.... as thankfully there's no long drawn out plot set up to endure....before you know it we are hurtling across the universe on a mission to discover the secret of life. Next thing you know....they are fighting for their lives.<br />Yes this one is intense, well written, acted & the sets n special effects are TOP NOTCH....add all that together & you have a film that grabs you by the throat & squeezes tighter & tighter until......well you'll just have to watch it & find out as i cant just tell you everything... much as i would like too.<br />This is a must see for most everybody as it will entertain, enthrall, fascinate & scare just about anyone even if they have no interest in the central theme as when the explorers get buried under an avalanche of ""unfolding alien circumstance"" you cannot help but feel some identification anxiety....after all....we are all still human aren't we? ;)<br /><br />Add note afterthoughts :<br />SPOILER alert!<br />Ok, in light of reconsideration i have downgraded my rating from 5 to 4 stars for the following reasons.<br />The psychotic violent nature of the ""engineer"" they woke up just did not make sense, i mean i can relate to being grumpy when woken abruptly from a sound sleep but that was uncalled for, perhaps if they had a giant cup of hot coffee ready for him things may have turned out differently? :)<br />The actions of the crew were amazingly unprofessional, case in point..... as soon as they get inside the pyramid they immediately all take off their helmets & breath in the alien atmosphere ... you would think at least one of them would have opted not to risk their life for the sake of bravado.<br />The entire crew appeared to be almost suicidally stupid, as a real expedition to an alien world would have required far more stringent security precautions that would have been followed to the letter. Safety seemed an afterthought or secondary consideration....instead of intuitive & primary.<br />Case in point... opting NOT to bring a weapon for defensive purposes into the alien pyramid was just crazy & simply hard to believe.<br />And then.... correct me if i am wrong but was one of those guys that got lost getting high as they were waiting inside the pyramid for the storm to pass? Are you kidding me? that just seemed weirdly out of place. I think that this was a necessary variable in the movie's ""outcome equation"" to set the stage of believability for the incredibly stupid thing that happens next....when the guy gets all friendly with the little slimy alien ""snake"" thing....as you would HAVE to be stoned stupid to approach & touch an alien life form that resembles a snake!<br />So yeah there are a lot of little things that detracted from the believability factor....yet despite that it did hold my attention & raise my pulse, so in the end it did not fail to impress & i find it to be a movie of merit nonetheless. Well...actually one star less.<br /><br />Ok, i would be remiss if i did not mention David, the deceivious android. As he is the most compelling  character of this movie....and the most intriguing cinematic portrayal of artificial intelligence to date. I cannot help but notice a similarity of shared character personality & plot purpose between David & Dr. Smith of the old Lost in Space series. As they both were subversive agents of change that had their own agenda or purpose in being that stood in stark contrast to their unsuspecting star faring companions. I dont think it is a stretch to connect the dots & assume Davids character design was largely influenced by the ""good"" Dr. Zachary Smith of LIS. In fact, it just occurred to me....that David is in an amalgamation of TWO characters from LIS, Dr. Smith AND ""the robot"" [did he ever have a name?] who became Dr. Smiths constant companion & ""friend"" if you will.  Much of the shows latter day episodes relied heavily on the barbed banter between these two.<br />Favorite scenes<br />1st one... has to be the fetus extraction in the surgery pod... WOW to say it was intense is almost an understatement..<br />2nd ... Vickers panic stricken race to leave her ship in the escape pod before the collision of the Prometheus & the alien craft & the ensuing aftermath that claims the life of the beautiful yet pernicious Vickers.<br />3rd.... The near end.....when Shaw loaded up Davids head & parts into the spare alien ship & they blasted off together in search of the engineers home planet for a final? confrontation that will occur in the next movie.....yes, it is set up perfectly for a sequel.<br />So, although i look forward to seeing this... and seeing what kind of nasty little surprises David has up his synthetic sleeve, i do not get my hopes up in seeing all the loose ends tied up so that it all makes perfect sense...as it IS just a movie that they are likely just making up as they go along & their bottom line is to make $ not pander to our insatiable need to know.<br />So likely the sequel will be very similar in it's overarching construct....great visuals, good acting, frenetic action, intense suspense & a plot with holes big enough to lose your interest in.<br />But i am OK with that....as the construct equation works....the movie moves with such forward momentum i lose little interest in the plot holes...so they are but minor speed bumps in an otherwise highly entertaining ride. But yeah, it WOULD be nice if it all came to a logical yet thought provoking conclusion. Time will tell soon enough."

B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	To put it bluntly, Prometheus isn't a movie for dummies. I haven't come across a single individual I know in real life, or reviewer online which both understood and disliked this movie. Generally it seems that if the person can grasp what's going on, they'll like it, if not love it. Sadly however, it seems that if you can't grasp what's going on, there's little chance you'll enjoy it. Unfortunately for Ridley Scott, despite being an action packed thriller, the concepts are a little too high brow for most folks, as most folks are desperately uneducated, deeply deluded by their respective religions, or some combination of both.<br /><br />Prometheus is true science fiction, and a basic understanding of both history and biology is required for anyone not blown away by the action. For the record, there are no plot holes, only morons who failed to comprehend what they were witnessing. If I have a suggestion to make to these negative reviewers, it is to watch it twice instead of dismissing it out of hand like so many others. I'd spend time explaining it, but really, that's as worthless of an approach as explaining a joke to someone who didn't get it the first time. They aren't going to laugh.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	Very predictable for adults but a great movie for kids.  Very classical theme of believing in Christmas, Santa, etc...  Strong characters make this movie a bit different from others.  I recommend it to all parents.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	My one criticism of this series was the fact that as a history teacher, I realized many people would be unable to keep up with the fast paced story.  They would not understand what was going on.  Even remembering the characters would be daunting. The DVD does a great thing by adding the historical onscreen commentary as an option while viewing.  Many nuances that would otherwise be lost in making sense of John Adams life and the time period are captured.  It gives the series a depth it was lacking.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"If only I could have given it negative stars.<br /><br />This movie starts out with interviews of people who were supposedly discriminated against in academia because of their connection to intelligent design.  I'm sure they think they were discriminated against, but Stein doesn't tell the entire story (a quick look at the Wikipedia page will set things straight).  The Smithsonian guy failed to follow peer-review procedures before publishing that article.  The next woman was only an adjunct and her contract ran out (happens all the time in academia).  The next guy didn't get tenure, but apparently he didn't have a good enough research record and didn't secure enough funding - other people at that institution didn't get tenure either, and they weren't connected to ID.  Again, happens all the time in academia.  I am an academic, and I have friends who have had their contracts run out as adjuncts and who have not made tenure because of a lack of funding - and none of them were associated in any way with ID.<br /><br />The second section is all about the reluctance of ""science"" to entertain skepticism of Darwinism.  Now I am not a biologist, but I am a Ph.D. scientist, and in my experience it is ok to question any theory or hypothesis, so long as you are using the scientific method to do it.<br /><br />The main problem is that intelligent design is inherently un-scientific.  Science is founded upon the scientific method - that you can only study (scientifically) that which you can concretely test.  That there is complexity in the world doesn't point to anything other than that we don't understand everything about the universe.  Could there be intelligent design?  Sure.  But there is literally no way to concretely test intelligent design (and none is put forth in the movie), therefore it is not capable of being a scientific theory.  For better or for worse.  And I'm not sure why its proponents would want it to be considered science anyway.<br /><br />Initially I thought that this was the point of the movie - to convince people that ID should be considered scientific, and presented as a viable alternative to actual scientific theories.  But the second half of the movie degenerates more and more into a blatant anti-science tirade.  Stein interviews two people who claim that Darwin's theory made them lose their belief in God, then generalizes to say that it was a story they heard a lot.  Hyping up fears that science is somehow going to turn people away from religion.<br /><br />In fact a huge chunk of the rest of the film is about God - yet he pretends that intelligent design is somehow not connected to God.  At one point Stein scoffs at the idea that aliens could have seeded the earth with life, but why scoff when that idea is 100% in keeping with intelligent design.  It involves a higher intelligence that ""designed"" life on earth, right?  So let's teach it in science classrooms!  It's just as legitimate as any other time-tested scientific theory...ha.<br /><br />The movie concludes with more anti-science propaganda, trolling out every stereotypical fear of the religious right and trying to trump up a connection between that and science.  Apparently science is responsible for Hitler being evil (actual quote from the movie ""evil can sometimes be rationalized by science"" - Stein puts it in someones mouth during one of the ridiculous Nazi scenes).  And I suppose you want me to believe that evil was never rationalized by religion?  How many people have been brutalized, oppressed, murdered in the name of God?  Why did the Nazis kill Jews?  That stemmed directly from religion.<br /><br />So from Nazism we go straight to an attack on Planned Parenthood (???), and from there Stein tries to blame science for abortion and euthanasia.  I guess he couldn't figure out how to rope any other staples of the religious-right's political agenda in, so the movie crescendos with statements about how science is attacking our freedom and all the wonderful things that America stands for.  Science is threatening the American dream.<br /><br />Really?  You went there?  How ridiculous you have made yourself look, Ben Stein.  But I guess you are a comedian."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	The other reviews say it all.  If you aren't familiar with the growing literature on the food situation, local, national, and global, this video will enlighten.  Watch it.  Share it.  And help make change.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	Whether or not you like this movie depends on what you want from a movie.<br />If you want a movie to tell a clear story - as the books do, and as the first Harry Potter movie did so well - then you will be very disappointed. Indeed, if you watch this movie without having read the book, you will probably not follow exactly what is happening. If this matters to you, I suggest you skip this movie altogether.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you like a movie to be full of spectacular special effects and don't care much about what the story is - or whether there is one - then you will love this movie. Buy it right away, if you haven't already.<br /><br />This explains why some reviewers think it's the best HP movie and others think it's the worst. It all depends on what you want. Obviously I prefer a movie to tell a tale, so for me, this movie gets the lowest possible rating.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	I'm not a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work, but I have to admit that I really liked this movie. I didn't think I was going to like it going into the theater and I actually didn't think I was going to like it half way through the movie, but I thought it was great.<br /><br /> This movie is a love story above everything else, but I also believe that it's a metaphor of the way our (and other people's) government/ruling-class controls our information and the way we think through complex media control and subtle indoctrination to preserve their way of life and America's interests. I think the monsters represent the way our government uses the fear of terrorism/communism/whatever to keep us in line. I think that &quot;The Village&quot; is just a microcosm of the United States. In the movie, they speak different than the people they seceded from... just like we speak different than the British... makes you think, huh?<br /><br /> It's interesting to try and figure out what M. Night Shyamalan is trying to say about our system and the people who are a part of it.<br /><br /> The directing and cinematography were awesome. It's a story about the power of love and a strong political commentary.

B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"It's been a long time since I've seen a movie in the movie theaters (having a one-year old will do that to you).  I've scrupulously avoided any spoilers for just about every summer movie out there, although more than one reviewer has given away quite a few surprises (I'm looking at you, Entertainment Weekly).  When we finally got a babysitter willing to take care of our little tyke for a few hours, we decided to given the second-run movie theater nearby a try.  And that movie was Iron Man.<br /><br />By now everyone knows the story of Iron Man: alcoholic weapons-merchant billionaire Tony Stark has a change of heart (literally) when shrapnel penetrates his ribcage and threatens to end his life.  Instead of making weapons, Stark vows to make a power suit instead...that is loaded with weapons, but let's not quibble over details.<br /><br />Iron Man is an adult's movie, which is to say it involves mature subjects like the fact that Stark is an inveterate womanizer, likes his alcohol, kills bad guys, and many of those bad guys look like Middle Eastern terrorists.  All this drama is tempered by Robert Downey Jr., who rattles off quips with abandon.  His keeper is Obadiah Stane (played by Jeff Bridges with suitable cranky menace).  Stark's assistant is the alliterative Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who runs the line between sweetly nave and sleekly sexy in her five-inch heels and pencil skirt.<br /><br />At its best, Iron Man features Stark uses his power suit to dodge jet fighters, kill terrorists, and rescue civilians.  The theater I was in didn't have very good audio, so the (presumably adlibbed) one-liners that Downey constantly tosses off were often lost in the sounds of explosions and screaming.  I imagine in a bigger theater or at home this wouldn't be a problem, but the movie lost some of its charm as a result.<br /><br />There are plot holes. Vanity Fair reporters show up at important news conferences. Stark seems far more interested in building a power suit than removing the shrapnel from his body.  And the entire premise of Iron Man revolves around ""repulsor lift"" technology, which is an infinite source of energy the size of a hockey puck that defies gravity. But if you didn't buy into the notion of a man in a flying suit, what are you doing watching the movie, right?<br /><br />Iron Man keeps the plot tight. Unlike Spider-Man, there are no extraneous supervillains. Unlike X-Men, every character is there for a reason.  But the big payoff for Iron Man is the ending.  Iron Man flips traditional superhero conventions the bird and dares you to guess what happens next.  Then it leaves you begging for more.<br /><br />And there IS more, if you stay for the end of the credits.  Unfortunately, I didn't read enough spoilers to realize I should have waited, so we missed it.  So for the three of you who haven't seen the movie yet...stick around!"
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	There are differences from the books, I'm guessing the boost ratings. Even with the changes it's still a great show.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Out of all Christians movies  i have ever seen this one is one of the best. Recommend it for couples facing<br />changes or difficult situations in their marriages .
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	This had to be the best, Harry Potter, movie so far. The pressure is on for our heroes in this installment, as Harry goes on the run. My niece and nephew both shed tears before the end of the movie. The adventure, excitment and overall magic level seemed to go up an extra notch in this film. I can't wait for the next one to come out. A must watch for Harry Potter fans and movie fans!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I am quite happy. Not only did I get my set up to date, it came factory sealed as promised. Very good price. Even arrived 2 days sooner than promised.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"There is a lot to `give away' in describing ""Iron Man', but suffice it to say that the film makers have created the real Tony Stark.  He is the rowdy billionaire responsible for building weapons of mass destruction and selling them to the enemy who then turns into a reluctant and then powerful `Iron Man'.  The cinematography is stunning in Blu-ray and the scenes starting from Afghanistan to Los Angeles's skies are over-whelming.  The action is intense, funny, witty and true to the character of the comic book character.  Plus, it is all believable.  Robert Downing, Jr. playing around with his Iron Man invention is nothing short of hilarious and thrilling.  Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit underused as his assistant, but she supplies some killer one-liners.  Jeff Bridges plays a role that truly threatens Iron Man, but that's all I'll say.  The effects are fantastic, the storyline is fast and clever and it is no small wonder it broke box office records.  On Blu-ray disc, it is just as good as being in a movie theater - the details, color and sound are that amazing!  Tony Stark IS `Iron Man'.<br /><br />All Blu-ray discs are set up differently according to their theme, but for Iron Man, I'll describe the screen imagery.  The initial PLAY/SCENES board is a colorful statue of Iron Man with colorful, comic book scientific looking diagrams.  Audio is available in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  There are some great extras like the `Hall of Armor' showing all four Iron Man designs, `The Invincible Iron man' and deleted scenes.  These deletions are great, including, 'I Am Iron Man', `Visuals Effects of Iron Man', a fantastic `Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test'. 'The Actors Process' (Downing and Bridges get down with some real improvisations), a semi-spoof trailer from `The Onion' on Iron man,' Theatrical Trailers, Galleries, Credits and Subtitles.  Not to leave anything out, more extras include six mini features such as `Friends and Foes' and ""Demon in a Bottle"".  If you're really into Blu-ray, try connecting to the Internet for BD-Live capability. This is one of the Blu-ray features that put it so far and above regular DVD."
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	"It is sometimes the case with films that sequels fail to match up to their predecessors.  ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is one of those times.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's latest incarnation of Indian Jones sees the story largely unchanged.  That is, Indy is still an archeologist whose life is more frenetic that the average university professor.  He is still fighting baddies.  He is still getting into scrapes but always comes through remarkably unharmed.  Never a broken bone in sight!  In the ""Crystal Skull"", the only change of significance is that a decade of time has passed and the bad guys are no longer Nazis but Russians.  This is after all, the peak of the cold war.<br /><br />Harrison Ford does an admirable job again as Indiana Jones but the show is stolen by Cate Blanchett who plays an evil Russian intent on bringing Indy undone.  Without Ms Blanchett, I'm not sure where this film would have ended up.<br /><br />My advice to Steven Spielberg is to put Indy out to pasture.  The brand is being tarnished.  Let's call a halt to the process so that we can fondly remember the films and not have the earlier works denigrated by these attempts to wring very last dollar out of the concept."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	The actors are great; the plot suspenseful; and, the ending is good too.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"Really powerful and haunting. Not an easy watch, partly because the only character who keeps to his code (and to the code of the West, that whole ""man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"" thing) is the homicidal maniac. The sheriff quits before the job is done in direct disobedience of his dad and lawman mentor, the bounty hunter begs for his life instead of toughing out his death, the cowboy is too busy flirting with the pretty girl to watch his six and gets killed. And the killer walks into legend. Spooky. I couldn't watch this movie a second time."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	In a long time!!! Took all my kids to see this when it was released, from age 3 to 17...it was an incredible blend of fantasy and faith, and touched my soul. Brings back childhood, no matter what your age. I was shocked more people went to see the Incredibles than The Polar Express...it will be a favorite dvd for years to come,and I can't wait to share it with my grandchildren in the future.<br /><br />Kathy Wilson<br /><br />The Budget Decorator
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"Okay, I am a HUGE fan of Ridley Scott AND of his second feature length film, ""Alien"" which is where the genesis of this movie came from.  What made that movie such a phenomenal flick is the stunning cinematography, story telling, pacing and acting -AND the visuals.  The grittiness of the characters, the tension between them before the movie really even gets going, watching them do their jobs -almost from a documentary style format.  That movie stunned audiences and deservedly so for 1979.<br /><br />This movie is a sort of ""prequel"" to ""Alien"" -though not completely.  The movie is obviously well filmed, has stunning visuals and effects, like its predecessor.  Now, to me -the acting was... okay.  You couldn't cut the tension with a knife -like in ""Alien"". The movie does, sort of, answer the question of where the aliens came from as well other little questions, like the ""space jockey"" and so forth.<br /><br />The time line for this movie is supposed to be before that of ""Alien"", though that movie was gritty (it WAS the 70's) and this film is very clean -too clean, almost like a ""Star Trek"" film.  There is no grittiness or realism to the characters -just nothing that makes you think these people could be you, me or anyone else.  To me this is a big issue as in the ""Alien"" film you could actually relate and connect to a degree with the characters.<br /><br />I admit that I did NOT see it in theaters, and ordered it as soon as it came out on blu ray (got a used copy, even!) so my excitement was high, and I admit that my expectations were thru the roof as well.  I also admit to being disappointed in this film... Scott is an excellent director (Alien, Gladiator, The Duellists, Black Hawk Down, BLADE RUNNER!) but this movie feels too commercial -there's nothing in it that makes me ""dare to want to see it"" like its predecessor. For ""Alien"" there were reports of people fainting, screaming and running out, and throwing up -if you went to see it, you were warned -this film you got none of that.<br /><br />Look, the bottom line is this: while I have complaints and issues with the film, I recommend it to those enthusiasts of the original ""Alien"" as it is an interesting entry after the fact.  I suggest if you've never seen it, before buying it, rent it -either thru Amazon or Redbox, first -then decide if buying it would be worth it to your budget."

B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"It's like rewatching ""Blood Simple"" refined and polshed by 20 years of movie making and 10 movies of maturing and experience. If this movie doesn't end up in the top 25 (if not maybe even the top 10) when the next AFI top 100 of all comes out ther's something radically wrong. Javier Bardeem is absolutely, totally, unbelieveably, incredibly good and Woody Harrelson makes a relatively small part into a really memorable one. Tommy Lee Jones is  Tommy Lee Jones - And it doesn't get better than that - does it?"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I am so very glad that I own this! True Blood is so very good! I also own all the books that this is based on. Both are truly great!!

The first day I was somewhat confident but 5 minutes into the workout, sweat was dripping off me. when the warm up was over i was standing in a puddle of sweat. The best thing about this program is that if you give all that you have you will see amazing results. It's the hardest workout you will ever do but if you have enough courage to try it you will get an amazing body.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	Although there are many variations of the Snow White fairy tale, this version strays quite far from all of them. A kernel of original story remains in this film but not by much. 'Snow White and the Huntsman' is not your kiddie fairy tale and parents need to be warned not to take little kids to this film. Some parents are very dense though. My local theater had to post warnings at the theater entrance that the movie was not for children. This version has been rewritten as an action adventure complete with haunted forests, a CGI troll, great battle scenes, and many many deaths. We even get to see Kristen Steward in a Joan of Arc getup. It is filmed with exqusitely beautiful scenery of the UK's Marloes Sands and a British coastline with a CGI castle added.<br /><br />The film begins with an excellent revision of the beginning of the Snow White tale. King Magnus, widowed and in lonely pain, rescues a beautiful woman named Ravenna who is held prisoner by a supernatural army. He brings her back to his castle. Played by Charlize Theron, the viewer can sense that Ravenna is not as she seems. Snow White, the king's daughter senses this from the start. Ravenna cleans up real good, seduces the king, marries him and kills him on their wedding night. Ravenna and her army take over the kingdom and imprison the young Snow White in the tower.<br /><br />'Snow White and the Huntsman' is a decent film even though much of the middle and end of the film feels somewhat forced. It is highlighted by great acting from a superb supporting cast; Charlize Theron in an other-the-top performance is excellent, Chris Hemsworth as the huntsman and Sam Claflin as Ravenna's brother are also both excellent. In fact the entire cast is very good except fot Kristen Stewart as Snow White. Stewart was a bad casting choice considering the other better actresses that were considered for the role. Her performance is flat and unconvincing.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	This does not have an extended version of the film, but it does have a lot of special features and is a very nice set for die hard fans.
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	"I'm loath to give a film of this technical achievement one star; however, two is the most I can give it.  All the pseudo intellectual babble aside, I found this an empty cinematic experience with many questions left unanswered and not so much by the anti-climactic and abrupt ending but pretty much by everything that preceded it.  And allow me to get this out of the way, I think Javier Bardem is a first rate actor but this was the most undeserving Oscar since Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential and, sadly, it has nothing to do with his performance as much as it does with a character that is seemingly nothing more than a killing machine and little else.  It was a one dimensional character played accordingly by Bardem.  The one thing about his past that we may glean is that he was, perhaps, at one time either a doctor or a medical student, judging by the expert way he chose medication and anesthesia and tended to his bullet wound.<br /><br />One review of his performance states the following: ""Javier Bardem's personification of psychotic evil fills the screen with an unflinching power -- it's as impossible for the audience to look away from him as it is for his victims to get away from him.""<br /><br />Give me a major break!!!!!!!!!!  I could fill the screen just as well if the cameras were focused on me continuously and I was slaughtering the greater populace of Southwestern Texas with unbridled tenacity.  It's mind-numbing and moronic reviews such as the aforementioned that have given this film (and Bardem's performance) the kind of relevance and undeserved fawning that it has received.  What?  Because the toss of the coin determines the fate of his possible victims, we're supposed to think ""Oh wow, how brooding and psychotic this character is and how profound Bardem's portrayal.""<br /><br />There were a few other things that I found downright strange, putting all philosophical musings to rest for a moment.  When Llewelyn stumbles upon the massacre of the drug dealers, he didn't react at all, as if though seeing bloody bodies strewn across the desert were as common as sand. I know he's a Vietnam vet, hardened and considerably emotionally detached, but his seeming indifference verged on pathological.  And if he is supposed to be seen as the other side of the Anton coin, then he would never have gone back with a gallon of water for the sole survivor of the slaughter who had begged him for some.  He would have just taken the money, allowed the survivor to die an agonizing death and taken off somewhere and I don't mean a motel in the neighboring town; I mean Ecuador or Norway or wherever.  It was like playing hide-and-go-seek and hiding in between the seekers legs and not expect to be caught.<br /><br />Another thing, this film takes place in 1980 (and I know that from the novel, as the film leaves this point ambiguous), yet Carson Wells, in his attempt to save his own hide, offers to take Anton to an ATM so that he may withdraw and give him, if I remember correctly $14,000.00.  First things first - ATM's did not become part of mainstream banking until the mid to late 1980's and secondly, what ATM, even today, allows one to withdraw that sum of money?  I doubt that in a border town in rural Texas, they were readily available.  Furthermore, when Carson saw the case of money on the river bank, why in God's name didn't he just take it and get back to the person who hired him to retrieve it in the first place instead of just leaving it there and going back to the hotel?<br /><br />Now that I've gotten the complaints out of the way, allow me to state that it is not a dismal a film as some have indicated.  Its production value are first rate and the performances are uniformly very good; however, Bardem's is not better than Jones's, Brolin's or Kelly MacDonald's (her efforts, I feel, were underrated).  There are some exciting set pieces and it's not remotely boring as others have mentioned and though the film has depth and the morality tale is evident, it is not, I repeat, deserving of cinema's highest honor."

B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"What can I say?  This DVD is fantastic and I have watched it at least 100 times since purchasing it--I have also dubbed the audio portion onto CD so that I might be able to listen to it in the car and at work!!  I have loved watching Jeff Dunham perform for a long time.  I recently got to see him in person and was thrilled with his performance!!  I would like to be able to see him perform at Kuss Auditorium in Springfield, Ohio if at all possible.  One of his newest characters, Sweet Daddy D, is the epitome of my Black brothers!! If anyone who sees this DVD doesn't find themselves laughing their heads off, then you must not have a sense of humor. Also, hearing Jeff do Sweet Daddy D is the first time that I knew what the word ""PIMP"" really means!! He is good at what he does and I hope he continues to do it for many years to come. Kudos to you, Jeff, for a job well done."
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	Having stated that I'm not necessarily a fan of the series doesn't mean I don't appreciate and actually have quite enjoyed several of the earlier films. This seems to go to a rather dark place which unto itself can make for great drama but I prefer to see the characters rise above the challenges. Wonderful acting, beautiful scenery (if mostly stark) but our intrepid heroes appear less and less intrepid - perhaps the point of their dire circumstances and maybe more realistic but not more preferable personally. A two part final episode might be a throw back to the cliff-hangers of earlier cinema but it doesn't seem to have the same sense of holding-one's-breath tension. The good guys are quite beaten down, the bad guy has all the advantage and you don't get the feeling the heroes are even ready to step up and face him. Obviously this is all personal preference, I like the little guys to at least keep getting their shots in and to be able to see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel (even if it turns out to be a train rushing at them). The Blu-ray set itself is top notch, wonderful quality print with plenty of extras, including what might be considered a lot of marketing for the last film. Why they think anyone buying this needs to be sold on the last episode.....?
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is one of the best acts to come along in years. If your not laughing at this you need to have your paulse checked
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie is better than any other movie ever made! Every time I thought I had the plot figured out, it took another turn, and that turn added even more positive lessons. This should be MANDATORY for all pre-marital counseling, and also for those who THINK they should be getting a divorce.  If all couples who are planning to marry would sit down together and watch this, then really talk, preferably with their pastor, they would probably have a more successful, happy marriage than without it. It should also be shown to ALL high school kids before they graduate...as they are about to step into the adult world, and plan to marry at some time, they should be made to think about this. I think it would change the horribly high divorce rate.<br /> DON'T HESITATE TO BUY THIS! It's an amazing, wonderful movie!!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is the best cardio workout you will ever come across, it really is insane.  Insanity is very addictive.  These DVDs are not for the beginner, you have to be in pretty good shape to be able to do these, even the warmup is intense. This was definetly the workout I was looking for.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I first ""met"" Jeff & Peanut in the early '90's on ""Stand-Up Spotlight"" on VH-1.  Fell in love with them.  Now, almost 20 years later, I've learned that a family friend had a hand in starting Jeff down the puppet/ventriloquist path.  I had him autograph the page in Jeff's book where he's mentioned & he told me, ""the facts aren't QUITE right, but I'll give it to him.  He's famous & doing well....."".<br />  My favorite bit was from the '90's when Peanut picked out a guy in the audience, ""Hey, Rob!  Neeeeeeeyowr!"" - Now I like the interplay of the characters.  Mr. Dunham has done very well for himself & I'm ALWAYS entertained!  Congratulations, Jeff!"
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"First off I thought the movie was all about monsters and demons.  Then after seeing the movie I was like ""Dude, rip off"", yet I enjoyed the movie.  Ok, many people who I know said that the movie is horrible, maybe they are expecting to see what I was expecting, a monster movie filled with gore and action.  I knew something like that was not going to happen, knowing what M. Night Shyamalan is capable of.  Great story and visuals, from the monster to the setting of the movie.  I love all of M. Nights' movies, can't wait for M. Night's next movie ""Lady In The Water""."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	It seems most of the positive reviews are long winded and don't tell you anything at all about this movie. To make it short - Expelled is absolutely terrible. Ben Stein is trying to explain something he clearly does not understand. The movie confuses facts, and misrepresents theories and facts. Terms are used wrong, and terms are even invented to just prove an incorrect point. Quotes and situations are taken completely out of context just to progress an invalid point.<br /><br />I would sell my copy for 0.01, but I wouldn't want to burden anybody with having their mind filled with fabricated information.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	The character Melvin the super-hero has been seen before on Comedy Central a few years back.  Achmed is the only NEW character not seen on TV in the past.  My wife, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, and myself saw Jeff in San Jose when he debuted Achmed.  It's a fine line that is crossed with the whole terrorism thing, but I'm sure Jeff has since improved on the character.  I just hope he discusses his daughter and his powder blue Prius like he does in his Improv acts.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"I find it hard to believe that anyone who has watched this with their children can not love this movie. There was one review that stated it was ""creepy"". I don't think so, I think it is just tapping into the magic of Christmas, is it really more creepy then the 3 ghosts that visit Scrooge? Again it is suppose to have a magic feel and magic is usually considered super-natural. Others said that the charecters are cold and cynical, I do not find that to be so. They are not so mushy and lovey as so many other kids specials, but personally I like that better. It makes them more human, and more realistic.<br /><br />I think this movie captures the imaginations of children and adults, and I am not someone who likes to watch much TV. My husband and I both enjoy watching this with our kids. It gets us into the Christmas spirit for sure. Most importantly, since it's a kids movie, our kids love it."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Some people have said this movie is scary including my mom who really wanted to see it. If thats how you think so be it but dont stop other people from seeing it. Im a big fan of Christmas movies and have never found it scary. I just wish Id known it was a Christmas movie when it was in the theater although in hindsight which is twenty twenty the word polar should have been a clue. What these people call scary I call thrilling and entertaining.To each his own I guess unfortunally. A little kid is unsure of the existance of Santa Claus so a train takes him to the north pole on Christmas eve. Thats all it is. The fact that it had a little action in it is just coincidental.That was probably done to keep viewers interested and all of you people who said it was to scary have obviously either missed the point of the movie or not bothered to watch it long enough. Or worse yet both. The conduter is trying to get the boy to believe.In Santa Claus. God. Something. Anything that you dont have to ask questions about. Isnt that what Christmas is suppose to be all about? Merry Christmas.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	My family tends to lean toward the darker, moodier films that go against the norm and this did not disappoint. I am not a particular fan of Stewart, but the storyline of this movie made it worth my two hours and eight minutes. The cinematography was good enough for my liking and at the end of the day, that's what counts - whether or not I liked it, not everyone else. I would give it five stars, but that seemed overly biased. As yes, for the type of film it was, I liked Mirror, Mirror too.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	As always I PITY the FOOL who just watches Harry. You need to read it too. This is a pretty good film and good set up for the battle of Hogwarts and final duel.<br /> I must say Hedwig had a much more heroic death in the film. In the book she just died in her cage.<br />But they should have used JK's dialogue between Harry and Ron about the deluminator.<br /><br />Ron: Dumbledore left it to me because he knew I would run out on you.<br />Harry: NO Dumbledore left it to you because he knew you would always want to come back.<br /><br />Or SOMETHING kinda like that, I can not seem to find it in the book now, but it was far more moving than the movie version.<br /><br />I am going to scribble on my scar with purple sharpie [ Dead center of my skull right between my eyes as JK intended.] Put on my round glasses, my black cape grab my wand and off to the final film. I MAY review it but who cares we have all read the book anyway.

B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	"Leave it to George Lucas to ruin another franchise. This lousy mish-mash of a film stinks of his tone-deaf storytelling, although he surely isn't alone shouldering the blame. Spielberg, after all, let him get away with it, and David Koepp (an otherwise decent screenwriter) gets credit for taking Lucas' ""story"" and trying to make sense out of it. Much like Episodes I through III tarnished the three original Star Wars films, this sad, overly long exercise makes the original Indy films feel like Oscar contenders."

B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	If you never see another comic but Jeff you'll be fine. He is by far the funniest and most talented ventriloquist ever. The way he gives each puppet it's own very distinct personality is amazing. Don't let the word puppet turn you off from this video he is still for adults. At least the unbleeped version. Which as a parent I appreciate the opportunity on this DVD to choose the bleeped version.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	Alright, let me say first that I agree completely that this movie (and the 4 that proceed it) is nothing like the book. Lots of things got left out, and sure, that disappointed me to lose the 'Weasley is our King' bit of the story. But let's face it, movies are not books. One cannot take a book and make it into a movie verbatim from the book; the movie would never end. Anyone ever read 2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke? Probably not. But I can guess that a lot of people saw that movie. Let me put it this way: the book was twice as long as the movie, and that movie felt like a funeral procession. The book was well written, and a bestseller if I'm not mistaken, but what the movie writers did was make a movie that left NOTHING out of the book, and therefore created a movie that caught the attention of many, but kept the attention of few.<br />Now, suppose for a second that you separate the HP book series from the movie series. Take them as two separate entities. The book series flows greatly alone, and the movies do just as well alone. When you start comparing the two, you open up a world of dissatisfaction that will never be quelled. Think of the books as merely a point of reference for the movies. Realistically, those who rant about the missing factors in book to movie translations probably also rant about movie to book translations, where things are added to create more character development. I know plenty of people who enjoy the Harry Potter movies, and hate the books, as well as those who love the books and hate the movies.<br />In and of itself, The Order of the Phoenix was well shot, cast, and directed. It has a dynamic story, and I still wanted to cry when our beloved Sirius died. Do yourself a favor, pretend you don't know anything about the story when you start watching these films, and we'll have a few less complaints on Amazon.

B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"One of the more highly-regarded superhero movies, I feel ""Iron Man"" deserves the acclaim. It has some excellent action sequences, but also balances them with a fair amount of drama. The dialogue is witty throughout and the story has a positive message. Each cast member delivers a superb performance, led by the reinvigorated Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.<br /><br />Taking over his father's company, Tony Stark is responsible for developing and selling modern weaponry to the United States government. While in Afghanistan to show off a new missile system, he is kidnapped by terrorists who want him to create the weapon for them. Instead, Tony creates his first Iron Man outfit. Seeing how the terrorists had been using some weapons created by his company to murder innocents, Tony has a change of heart over selling weaponry and wants the company to cease weapons selling. This doesn't sit well with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who takes care of the company's daily operations and ultimately opposes the change. Tony still goes one step further and develops a more advanced Iron Man outfit to go up against the terrorists.<br /><br />As for his personal life, Tony Stark is a playboy whose only real constant is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his personal assistant. It soon becomes clear just how much they care for each other. His only other real ally is Lt. Col. Rhodes (Terrence Howard), who helps bail Tony out. The scenes with Pepper and Rhodes include many of the better moments, both dramatic and humorous.<br /><br />This movie works well because the action is well-done without completely overshadowing the drama and humor. The excellent writing, acting, and effects make it an enjoyable movie which loses little to nothing in repeat viewings."

B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	The movie starts off well, but clearly begins to lag as Kristen Stewart becomes the focal point.  The scenes with Charlize as the Queen are the most intriguing part of the movie and she clearly steals the film.  In the middle where she is absent for large gaps, the movie drags.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Based on David McCullough's excellent biography, the HBO miniseries does not disappoint.  It is thorough and dramatic, with wonderful performances and terrific writing.  Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are outstanding as John and Abigail Adams, and the supporting cast is great as well.  This is a must for history buffs, as well as for those who don't really know much about the founding of our country and/or John Adams himself.
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	the dvd's that do work are fun, but 1/2 the dvd's did not work in any of my dvd players and that is very frustrating when something you buy new and pay a lot of money for doesn't even work.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	What can you say, Ben Stein asks all the right questions.  The importance of ID is the moral and epistological implications.  I believe this to be the best video I have seen addressing the moral weaknesses of a naturalistic view of life.  If you were only going to see one video on ID as a way of thinking - this would be the one.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"Both me and my 6 years old daughter we loved this movie - although of course for different reasons.<br /><br />She appreciated the very idea of talking cars and then the races, Mator the ""red-neck"" car, etc. I was impressed by the animation - this is for the moment the most technically advanced animation movie I ever saw (""Happy Feet"" did as well) - and the more adult oriented humouristic parts (a Porsche girl who left Los Angeles to find peace in a small town; an old town doctor, called Doctor in Internal Combustion; the cars going to the toilet - guess which line is advancing faster..., a rivalry between a ""Peace and Love"" old van and a retired sergeant who is of course a jeep, a Japanese female journalist who is a gorgeous little Honda, etc, etc.).<br /><br />The final scenes in which they show fragments of older Pixar movies (like Sully and Mike Wazowski stranded in Himalayas) played by cars (the Yeti being an enormous snow tractor) are a delight. I just can not uderstand some of very critical (and mean) reviews below - I loved this movie and, more important, my daughter loved it too. She insisted on sleeping on a pillow with Ligthning McQueen for months after that...<br /><br />If you didn't see it - go and get it."

B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	"(UPDATED on April 9, 2012)<br /><br />Most recently, Provident Films and Sherwood Pictures (the folks responsible for Facing the Giants, Fireproof, and Courageous) lashed out at Steve Taylor's Blue Like Jazz, a film which approaches issues of faith with brutal honesty and respect, based on Donald Miller's bestselling memoir. For whatever reason, they feel threatened by the film, which is probably going to change the ""Christian film industry"" as we know it. Provident Films and the good people at Sherwood decreed that anyone who had participated in the making of Blue Like Jazz would never, ever work on a Provident production in the near future. You see, Blue Like Jazz is a game changer. It is an attempt to bring authenticity into the realm of faith-based film, and so far, the response from audiences around the globe has been extraordinarily positive. Looking back on my review of Fireproof (posted below in quotations) Blue Like Jazz seems like a godsend.<br /><br />Here are a few simple truths that I learned from Fireproof: If your marriage is on the rocks and you simply cannot control the wellspring of anger growing inside of you, there is something that you can do: take it out on the trashcan. If that doesn't work, smash your computer - first the monitor, and then the tower. A baseball bat or a large stick should do the job. While you're swinging the bat and/or stick with one arm, make sure you have a copy of ""The Love Dare"" in the other. Keep a steady swing while you read. There are forty-something pages to read, one page for each day. Do all of these things, and afterwards, all of your problems should automatically disappear and everyone in your immediate family will get saved, just like magic! The end.<br /><br />I have recently watched Fireproof again. People claimed that I was a bit too harsh on the film the first time around. Well, it all comes down to this:<br /><br />I cannot believe that this is the best that we Christians have to offer to the film industry. This film is basically a tract disguised as a movie. I found it incredibly offensive and false. There isn't one moment of authenticity to be found in the entire film. As it is, there is only one audience for this catastrophe - an explicitly Christian audience. Any non-believer approaching this material is likely to feel alienated for the majority of the running time.<br /><br />I'm not going to lie. Fireproof is terrible. From the dialogue to the acting to the production values, it is one huge train wreck. I understand that the filmmakers used what they had to work with. This is obvious. However, other indie filmmakers have approached projects under similar conditions with much better results. Don't get me wrong - I admire the church for pulling together and getting the film in theatres. Not an easy thing to do. But a film class or two wouldn't hurt at all. Maybe they could read a few textbooks on Bergman and Kubrick. Perhaps an in depth study on human nature would help with character development. The way in which the characters interact in this film made me wonder if the filmmakers had ever had any real contact with an actual human being. No one talks like that. No one acts like that. It was incredibly distracting. The heavy-handed Gospel message took me completely out of the film. This is the point at which the film stopped being an ordinary corn-fest, and segued into grade- A propaganda. A little subtlety would have been nice, and could have possibly lent the filmmakers some sort of credibility. Ingmar Bergman focused on faith a great deal, and although he dealt with the subject with a touch of ambiguity, he still said what he wanted to say, and it came across as a work of art, and a foundation upon which people of every background could discuss the issue of religion and faith. There are times when Fireproof comes at you like a fifty foot Bible - just waiting to stomp you over the head with its skewed portrayal of the Christian life. In the world of Fireproof, all of the conflict ends at the moment of spiritual conversion. This is an unrealistic, dangerous lie to unleash on any audience, believer or non-believer. The Christian walk is full of doubt and constant struggle. A commitment to God does not guarantee - and does not even promise - freedom from such things.<br /><br />The Kendricks still have a lot to learn about the art of filmmaking, about human interaction, and, most importantly, the cold, hard facts concerning conflict in relation to the Christian walk.""<br /><br />Upon reading this, some of you may feel that my critique of the film is a bit extreme. That's okay. My opinion is still the same and has yet to be swayed, and I sincerely doubt that I will ever sit through Fireproof again. The fact of the matter is this: the audience of today craves honesty, and so far, the faith-based film industry has failed to deliver on every conceivable level, opting to play it safe with squeaky-clean moralism and sermonizing, leaving little to no room for reality. This is a sickening trend in the realm of faith-based artistry, and the audience is catching on. The motivating factor which initiated this current fiasco with Provident Films and Sherwood Pictures can probably be summed up in one word - fear.<br /><br />It's all coming to an end.<br /><br />Blue Like Jazz has finally arrived.<br /><br />Things are about to change."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"I bought this DVD for the same reason everyone else did: I saw it in the theater and loved it. If I ever get my surround sound home theater set up this is the first movie I'm going to watch. Pixar's movies keep getting better and better.

B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Get ready to be entertained folks! I was preparing myself to be somewhat disappointed. After all, many of the comic books transformed to films have a history of sucking hard, but Iron Man comes through with a finely adapted screenplay, top notch action, not to mention a great cast. ILM again comes through with the best CGI money can buy, this time with a winner of film for a change. It also looks as if Robert Downey Jr. (an actor I had always liked) is back in his game. His unfortunate downward spiral in the mid 90's up through the last several years nearly destroyed his acting career. I hope this time around, he's here to stay.<br /><br />So, getting to the ""main course"" Tony Stark is a billionaire engineer genius/philanthropist and has  been compared to the likes of Leonardo Davinci. His inherited genius comes from his father who started it all designing weapons for the military where he picked up and designed some of the worlds most destructive weapons of war.During one of his excursions and promotional gigs to ""sell"" his new ""bang, bang"" toy, he is kidnapped during an ambush where he is forced to make the same weapon for ""the enemy"" that will be used on theirs. Stark decides to do something else, and in of all places, makes his greatest creation to free himself from captivity....""the suite"" which is a crude form of what will be his masterpiece.<br /><br />Upon his escape and back home, he has an epiphany. Instead of making weapons of death and destruction for the military, he wants to design things to help mankind and put an end to war. This does not settle well with his business partner Obadiah, played by the excellent Jeff Bridges who has ""alternate"" plans. There he designs the suit of all suits through trial an error to put a stop to his weapons being sold and placed in the wrong hands and defend those who need it the most. This immediately put him in the wrong cross hairs of everyone. Soon Obadiah discovers what Stark has created and copies his suit design, only far more destructive and menacing.<br /><br />Well worth watching, Iron Man finishes SOLID. Downey 's character has some great lines and lots of dry, sarcastic and quirky humor. It keeps a good flow through the entire film from start to finish. Of course in this day an age in film making, Iron Man finishes with the hint (and most likely the promise) of continuing stories to come in the future. Well worth seeing for the theater experience, this is not one to miss folks. Saddle up for some hard hitting action and a bitch'in good time."
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	For the record, the only two films of Scorcese that I have enjoyed were Raging Bull and Last Temptation. I think he is hugely over-rated and typically Italian: everything is the mob mix of gratuitous violence, sex and religious chicanery. Whaddaya want from an ex-jesi? Maybe not The Aviator - that was more like gratuitous boredom, possibly the most insufferably dull film of all time.<br />So we have here in this Oscar winner the latest imaginative turn in Hollywood gangster films: acknowledging that everyone has seen all the Italian mob stories they can stomach, make a movie with an Irish mob! Quel Intrigue! This is almost as stupid as Gangs of New York. Jack Nicholson does his rote version of Evil Jack, just back from The Shining Retirement Home. Leonardo continues his spin with as nearly fake a Boston Irish accent as you can get this side of Johnny Depp. Martin Sheen is adrift - what happened to him? Did the West Wing suck all the believability out of him? Wahlberg is pretending to be Matt Damon. Again. And Matt Damon looks like he is hoping there's another Bourne film in his future. You do a Scorsese Film for the same reason you do a Woody Allen film - it buys you respect among your peers - see, more Italian mob brio - not because the film is any good.<br />It's not that this is a bad film (that was Aviator & Gangs - anyone who casts Cameron Diaz in a drama should have their Kodachrome taken away), it's just that it nips every mob cliche in the book and re-casts them with a Boston accent - WOW! Like a dead horse head? how about a severed hand? Like Marlon Brando's mumbles? how about Jackie's leers? Double crosses and snitches? we got 'em. The only two good crime films I have seen in the past 10 years were Usual Suspect and Layer Cake, and this film is real rubbish compared to them. It is as pruriently violent as Passion, and that's not a compliment.<br />If you are worried about your Jersey or Little Italy credentials being taken away, you better say you think this is great. For the rest of us, yawn.
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	I'm a fan of comic book adaptations but i have to say Iron Man just did not do it for me. I felt that nothing new was added to the comic book adaptation genre, not in plot, screen writing or even special effects. It looked to me like it has all been done and seen before. I did not quite understand what all the hype surrounding this movie was about Robert Downey Jr. was not very convincing as a good guy i liked him better when he was selling weapons and couldn't care less about anyone else, his good side felt to me as somewhat forced on him, didn't believe it. Although i love Gwyneth Paltrow i hated this part for her, it was just meaningless and very secondary, any up and coming actress could have done that role. Paltrow should have never agreed to it.<br />All in all i do not think this movie has what it takes to be on the top ten list of best comic book adaptations.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	This was a pretty good movie. I didn't like the ending, but that's because the viewer does not know what happened after the ending. You are left wondering. Over all a good movie.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	I have been an Indy fan since the first movie.  That absolutely ends with this movie.  This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen come out of the Lucas camp.  Yes, even worse than Star Wars: Phantom Menace.  They waited so long to come out with another title in this killer series, and when they do, it is junk.  I can't even imagine what they were thinking when they came up with some of this worthless material (the nuclear fridge, the killer ants, vine swinging with the monkeys, etc, etc, etc.)  This movie represents 122 minutes of my life that I will never get back.  As far as I am concerned, there are only 3 movies in the Indiana Jones series, and this one definitely isn't one of them.  Don't waste your time.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	While it is true that there is a lot missing from what was in the book, I think they did a good job for the time they had to work with in one feature film.

B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I rented it but will eventually purchase this video.  I really like the different take on a very popular fairy tale.
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	I am a die-hard Harry Potter fan, but have to say this movie was a HUGE disappointment. The scenes were short and choppy. It felt almost like a poorly constructed Cliff Notes version from someone who hadn't read the books all the way through. I recognize that it was a long book to condense into a movie, but the movie bounces from scene to scene without taking the time to develope relationships between the characters, or even the characters themselves. Not even Emma/Hermione's usually superior acting has a chance to shine through the limits imposed on her by a fragmented script.<br /><br />I would give the previous movies a 5, 5, 5, 4. I have not always agreed with the decissions the director made with what he cut. For example, I missed Dursleys and Dobby in the 4th movie, but those difficult decissions on the part of the director and screenwriter allowed for the scenes that remained to be fleshed out in a meaningfull way and relationships to be developed in a way that was fufilling to the viewer and characters. The harsh reality that the director and screenwriter of Order of the Phoenix failed to grasp is that you simply can't include everything without making a longer movie (which is what I would vote for and pay extra to see - it is possible, think of the Lord of the Rings trilolgy).<br /><br />For example, what is the point of introducing Tonks to see her grump at Moody for 2 seconds, and see her change her nose. She wasn't even given the opportunity to show her dueling skills in the ministry (she is only on the screen a few seconds). Why bring Lupin back for the scant couple minutes of screen time he gets? It is just disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying.We do not feel the pain at the loss of Sirius the way the reader did with the book because the director does not give their relationship the screen time it needs. Indeed, it would have been an incredibly difficult movie to follow or even understand for someone who has not read the book at least once, and probably twice.<br /><br />A serious disappointment.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Any filmmaker seeking to adapt a Cormac McCarthy novel faces the significant problem that a large part of the strength of each is the pure poetry of McCarthy's prose.  In No Country for Old Men the Coen brothers provide cinematography that serves as a suitable stand-in for the poetry of McCarthy's prose.  They back that up with a sharp attention to detail.<br /><br />There are three main characters: Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss, hired-killer Anton Chigurh, and rural county sheriff Tom Bell.<br /><br />The Coen brothers capture perfectly one of McCarthy's themes--the dichotomy  between extreme violence and genuinely nice regular folk.  There is also a dichotomy between the poetry of so much of the dialogue and monologues, especially the sheriff's musings, and the ordinariness of dialogue with tertiary characters.<br /><br />And it is a very violent movie.  Chigurh kills 10-14 people, depending on your opinion on murders that appear to happen off-screen.  Which isn't that strange; more unconventional is the ending, which may be off-putting to many.<br /><br />DVD extras: The Making of No Country for Old Men (spoilers), Working with the Coens, Diary of a Country Sheriff, and trailers for Dan in Real Life, National Treasure 2, and Gone Baby Gone.<br /><br />This review is of the original DVD edition.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	"David Yates took on a thankless job as director of ""Phoenix,"" based on what was (to me) a dull and dreary book.  He's stuffed in all the book's action, such as it is, but it feels very much like a checklist:<br /><br />Dementors in Little Whinging (check)<br />The Order of the Phoenix in London (check)<br />Dolores Umbridge in pink (check)<br />Dumbledore's Army (check)<br />The battle at the Ministry (check)<br /><br />Yes, it's all there, but done without the slightest bit of emotion, suspense, or magic.  Handsome Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) gets no chance to play the matinee idol; he's reduced to rushing breathlessly from scene to scene looking surprised and saying little.  Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) have so little to do and say that they're virtually lost in the shuffle.  Ralph Finnes (Voldemort) is more annoying than scary, and Helena Bodham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) utters just two lines.  Even the long-awaited Kiss with Harry and Cho is totally lacking in feeling - just do it and move on. (check)<br /><br />The cast and crew aren't to blame for this tepid, choppy, confusing mess; the interminable book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/043935806X"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)</a> had about 800 pages of filler.  It bothered me that we don't really learn anything about the titular ""Order"" in either book or movie.  The mysterious (ooooh!) ""prophesy"" deserved a single paragraph in the book and a short scene in the movie, yet it's the centerpiece of both(?).  Yates did the best he could with this tedious story, but it's the first Harry Potter film that didn't leave me dreaming wistfully of the wizarding world."
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	This is one of the few DVDs that I can honestly say changed my life.  I watched it 6 months ago, and just ordered a new copy to share with friends because I think the content is so important. It changed the way I think, the way I shop, the places I shop, the way I cook and the way I eat.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	"Overall, the workout is excellent and you will work harder than you ever have before.  I am going on my fourth week of the workout and have lost about 11 lbs all ready.  However, make sure you order the ""real thing"".<br /><br />I ordered this from a different company because it was only around $75 not realizing that it was an unofficial copy.  When I received it, I was actually missing two of the dvd's.  It has been four weeks and I have still not received them.  I have received tons of promises but nothing.  I cannot figure out where this company is even located and will probably not be able to get my money back.  (I was lucky that one of my friends bought this and is not using it so I was able to borrow his copy.)  This company is located in a different country, the dvd's are in a smaller booklet compared to the ""real thing"", and it is much cheaper.  It is not worth trying to save the money...just buy the official set and you will save a ton of time and energy.<br /><br />All in all, the actual content of the dvd's is great and this has rejuvenated my workout!"
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"This is one of those movies that you have to watch two or three times to make sense of all the intense action. It is riveting and you can't take your eyes off the screen!<br /><br />I have been waiting for Leo Di Caprio to do a truly ""manly"" and tough role in a believable way, and this is the role. He is convincingly tough and does an incredible job in this movie. In my opinion Leo has been miscast in a number of films as a tough guy, most notably in Gangs of New York. He seems truly grown up in this movie.<br />Matt Damon is excellent, although as one of my favorite actors I hated to ""love to hate"" him in this morally degenerate role.<br />Jack Nicholson annoyed me. He does a great job, but I just found myself thinking that Daniel Day Lewis or Byrne, or someone of that ilk would have been a better choice for the role of Costello.<br />I did not understand the ending. Maybe after viewing several more times?..."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My boys love this movie so much, even after watching it for over 2 years. I've bought it 5 times because they keep scratching it, but hey, what's not to love?
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This was a great movie.  I even had my 76 year old father watching it with me.  If you like cars, comedies, or animation, it has something for everyone.  Great humor and a good story.  I highly recommend everyone watch this movie.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Great movie.<br />Greatest movie villain since Jack Palance in ""Shane"".<br />Heartless, ruthless, ... you can't take your eyes away from him.<br />*** Viet Nam vets are very vulnerable.<br />Greed and avarice are to be left to the professionals, 'cause most of us can't hold our own against such ideas.***<br />Who's better, Brolin, Barden, or Jones?  Try to figure that one out, and you'll watch this movie way more than once. All 3 perform at dramatic levels we literally don't see too often.<br />Stunning presentation.<br />Baren.<br />Beautiful.<br />Lonely.<br />McCarthy.<br />Can't wait to see ""The Road""!!  Hope the Coen brothers see fit to do that movie, too.<br />A++"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Not much to say, I love TrueBlood.  I purchased this to see the first season before ordering HBO to watch the 2nd season on Sunday nights.  Now I'm ready to add Season 2 to the collection!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Movies don't get much quicker than this head-spinner. If you know the Whitey Bulger story from South Boston, you'll enjoy Jack Nicholson's twists. After you watch this, most other movies will seem slow and dull by comparison. Great soundtrack, as usual, for Scorcese, a music lover. But how many times can he recycle ""Gimme Shelter""? The cat and mouse game at the movie's center is riveting, if silly. And the fake Boston accents by all except Mark Wahlberg, whose accent is real, will make you cringe if you're really from Boston. Even so, this one is a keeper."
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	I have watched episodes 1-10 at this time.  I enjoyed them very much.  I would say that they are an R rating for the sex and the blood.<br />The movies follow the first book (Dead until Dark) in the Sookie Stakehouse series by Charlaine Harris very well.
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	The good: plays perfectly in my Blu-Ray and computer.<br /><br />The bad: No alternate audio, no subtitles, no menu... I did not know the movies purchased through these type of services were lacking these features.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I've read the first couple books and I will admit that I prefer the show. You get more in depth with the show. You also get to see characters that only appear as side characters in the books become more flushed out in the show. Very entertaining. I love it. 5 stars. *****
B001684L0A	1.0	b	I have heard that John Adams is a marvelous mini-series and wanted to order it for my son's visit Thanksgiving week.  Unfortunately, it never arrived.  Amazon refunded my money, but I was very disappointed.  Better luck next time- first time this ever happened.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie would be excellent to view at a couples retreat. It was shown at a retreat that my husband & I attended. There wasn't a dry eye, a wonderful example of how FORGIVENESS will heal everyone involved.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Hey I love any movie that has Martin Scorsese's name stapled on it. THE DEPARTED is no exception, this movie definitley brings him back to his roots. Tons of F-bombs, violence, solid acting, and a solid story line. Ofcourse if you're not aware at this point that this movie is actually a remake of the original classic INfernal Affairs, then you need electric shock therapy. I've seen both movies and really, both movies are nothing alike other than several scenes ala the elevator shootout and the story. The rest is all Scorsese. THE DEPARTED is more of a stand alone. Infact it was mention that the movie is an 'adaption' not a remake. But heck. Who cares, the movie was amazing and that what counts, despit countless remakes there has been recently, here's one filmmaker who actually gives a s888.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	This was a Christmas gift for my grandson......age 12.  He just loves it & was a great hit.
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	Ok here it goes. If you have bad knees, shoulders, or any other body part then this is not for you. If you are already in shape then this will not get you in more shape. Insanity is just a cardio work out and it is difficult at time but there is nothing in the videos that you can't do on your own. For 30 to 60 minutes you will do mainly a leg, calf, thigh, and butt work out with some push ups and abs in there too. Many times through the videos some of the exercises repeat from previous workouts that you have already completed.<br />My final statement is: If you belong to a gym or have the motivation to do some physical activity with your life the don't buy this.<br />If you are one of those people who try a new diet or fad every week to try to lose weight or get in shape then try this out waste your money and start something new the next week.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"The book was genius, and the HBO miniseries lives up to that standard from beginning to end.  The actors truly bring to life the author's ""warts and all"" vision of our founding fathers.  Everyday facts of life in the late 1700s will strike you in ways they never occurred to you while studying history - for example, when you read in school that John Adams spent years in Europe, first looking for supporters for the revolution, then representing the new country as ambassador, did it ever occur to you that he would return home to adult children he wouldn't recognize, because he hadn't seen them since they were toddlers?<br /><br />Everything from the acting to the directing to the sets, costumes and makeup is perfect.  Don't miss this!"
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	WOW! First I want to say that I'm not a very religious person, so when someone suggested my husband and I watch this movie I was a little skeptical because I just knew it was going to be preachy..<br /><br />My marriage is in serious trouble due to a lot of differnt events. Some are from my own selfishness and some are from my husbands substance abuse and infidelitys. I had heard so much about this movie that I was beginning to think that maybe I would give it a shot... You know.. what did I have to lose.. maybe an hour and a half of my time..<br /><br />So I talked my husband into watching it with me and surprisingly we both enjoyed it. I could really relate to the couples marriage in that movie.. it was almost like someone had been filming our lives.<br /><br />The movie was kind of bibical at times but honestly I did not mind it at all..  I found myself thinking about this movie for the next few days and the message it gave me.. Maybe the one thing that my marriage is missing is God.. I believe in God but I have never had a relationship with him.. I have always equated God with bible thumpers and alter calls at the church, not a power greater then myself whom I can rely on anytime any where.. He certainly has not been present in my marriage.<br /><br />I'm really glad I watched this movie and I'm seriously considering buying it so I can watch it again.. I think it might take me a few times of viewing this to really appreciate the message behind it..<br /><br />My Mother in Law gave us the book the Love Dare for Christmas and I kind of tossed it aside but now since I have seen the movie I have been flipping through it thinking that maybe I should give it a shot.. After all I have tried everything else to save my marriage, what do I have to lose.. I figure I lose nothing by taking 40 days and really trying to work on my marriage but I lose everything by sitting there and doing nothing.. So tomorrow I will start day 1 of the Love Dare... maybe I will be pleasently surprised by that as well.<br /><br />Even if your skeptical.. give it a shot.. honestly what do you have to lose?
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	I don't know why so many people gave this film bad reviews.  I thought it was awesome!! The cinematography was beautiful, special effects were very well done and costumes were amazing. I think some reviewers thought oh, this is a KStew movie...all Twilighty and such. But this was really great. This girl CAN act and haters need to stop hating. I just love her--so beautiful!  Charlize was amazing as the wicked queen and yummy Chris Hemsworth, Yowza!! Loved the fairies and Fairy Land! Don't miss this one. It is pretty epic! Can't wait to get my DVD!
B001684L0A	4.0	b	A great miniseries, you need to have plenty of time to watch as it is very long. Great acting and fairly accurate. Recommend to all those who would like to know more about the founding of America. History buffs would enjoy.
B000S5KGH4	2.0	b	"If you love comdey, you will love Jeff Dunham's ""Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself"". Even if you seen it on Comedy Central, you will want to own your own copy so you can watch Walter and Peanut and the others over and over. We love our copy and have shared it with others. This DVD is too funny to miss. Jeff reaches out to all ages and all kinds of people every where."
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	It was better than I thought it was going to be. But it was really weird. It had alot of action, so if you like action movie, you will like this one.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I loved this film!<br /><br />THE DEPARTED is an intense cops and gangsters opera with an all-star cast, including Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg. Jack Nicholson, as sociopathic crime boss Frank Costello, is excellent as always. Leonardo DiCaprio's role as Billy Costigan, going straight from Cadet to undecover, in my opinion is his  best performance yet. As for Martin Scorsese, this film will stand alongside MEAN STREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, GOODFELLAS and CASINO as the director's best work.<br /><br />Set in modern day South Boston, involving the Irish Mob and the Massachusetts State Police, THE DEPARTED is a tale of two young guys entangled in that old Irish-American dilemma of love and respect for both outlaw and cop, the two often freely intermingling within neighborhoods and families, blurring identities and allegiances.
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	You have to give Robert Rodriguez credit for remaining faithful to Frank Miller's vision, but the graphic novels do not translate very well to the screen.  It reminded me alot of Richard Romanus' Heavy Metal, as Rodriguez tried to piece together several of Frank Miller's stories into one movie.  Still, I liked the look and feel of the movie, a deeply saturated black and white with spot colors.  It was interesting to see such actors as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood transformed beyond all recognition.  Clive Owen proved to be an inspired choice as Dwight, making a good contrast to Benecio del Toro's talking head.  But, in the end, this movie simply didn't add up.  It was more like a promotion for Frank Miller's serial graphic novels, which he continues to put out having gone beyond comic heros such as Batman and the Daredevil.  This isn't kids' stuff, but a series drenched in lurid sex and violence, which seems to be the staple of pulp fiction these days.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	I WAS PRETTY EXCITED WHEN THIS CAME OUT FOR IT LOOKED REALLY COOL!  WHAT A LET DOWN.  THREE THUMBS DOWN!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"I've seen so many appeals for logic and reason in academic discussion for the origns of the universe.  Ben investigates the orthodoxy of evolution and the walls in science and society that have been created to marginalize any other options of thought outside of evolution.  The computer modeling of the cell dramitizes the complexity of life at it's basic level. It is fascinating and much more realistic than any textbook illustrations.<br /><br />The dialogue between proponents of intelligent design and evolution has been crippled with self-righteousness.  ""Might is not right""  in the academic world, except for evolution, thus ""Expelled"" has the precise title."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This DVD was in great shape.  It plays well!  I would definitely buy from this vendor again!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	jeff dunham is one of the best comedians working today. the puppets make hum good what makes him great is that he doesn't need the puppets to be funny. he's an amazing ventriliquist and comedian I highly reccomend all his stuff.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	There is so much bad word of mouth out there about &quot;The Village&quot; that I had to go see it by myself because nobody wanted to see it with me. I avoided all the publicity about M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film so that I could make up my own mind. Besides, if the whole point is to see whether he can fool us again, why would you want to know anything on the chance that it would be too much? If the film gets spoiled by a review, then that is hardly giving the film a chance. Even when Penn & Teller show you how they do their trick, they get to do the trick first.<br /><br /> The Village is located in a valley surrounding by Covington Woods. The year is 1897 according to the tombstone we see at the start of the film. As we are introduced to life in the community we learn about the strange rules under which its inhabitants live. If you did not read the rules on the poster for &quot;The Village,&quot; they are enacted during the first part of the film. Red is a bad color that cannot be seen because it attracts them, while mustard yellow is a color of safety. No one can enter the woods because that is where those of whom no one speaks will get you. If the warning bell is sounded, then head for the cellars in your houses immediately because they are coming.<br /><br /> A council of elders run the village, and their leader is clearly Edward Walker (William Hurt). They set the tone for the village, but in the wake of the death of a young child because of sickness, young Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to leave the village, travel through the forbidden woods, and bring back medicine from one of the towns on the other side. Lucius is uncommonly brave. The young boys test their courage by standing on a stump on the border between the village and the woods, and Lucius is the record holder. But his courage could doom the Village by breaking the truce that has held between the two sides for many years.<br /><br /> Most of that you can pick up from the trailers for &quot;The Village.&quot; Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius is clearly the hero of the film and you know know that there is no reason to set up these rules if they are not going to get violated as a major plot development in the film. Beyond that it is difficult to say anything that would not interfer with your chance to enjoy the film on its own terms. However, there are two things I can say.<br /><br /> First, given that he has backed himself in a corner it terms of always having to come up with some big secret twist for all of his films, Shyamalan does try to come up with something to meet the raised expectations. You can certainly decide afterwards that the secret was not big enough or good enough, but unless the film has been spoiled for you I cannot believe you are going to see everything that is coming. As we know from &quot;Signs&quot; and the rest of his films if there is one thing Shyamalan can do it is that everything fits together in the end.<br /><br /> Second, as I started to get into this film I decided that the character I really liked was Ivy Walker, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. That is the one name that appears in the opening credits that I did not recognize (remember, I avoided all the publicity) and so when it turned out that Bryce was playing Ivy, and that the actress is the daughter of Ron Howard I was surprised (no wonder she looked familiar without my recognizing her). This is a breakthrough performance, which may well be the only thing that everybody who sees &quot;The Village&quot; is going to agree on.<br /><br /> Early on in this film I decided what I wanted this film to be, not expecting that it would actually end up being that, so when it did I was both surprised and gratified. Since I never put much significance into the meaning of Shyamalan's movie twists, focusing instead on whether or not I could be fooled, &quot;The Village&quot; certainly meets the criteria. He got me. Again.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Overall a great movie for all the Potter fans. I especially liked the Maximum Movie Mode, anyone who has not read the book should see the movie in this mode, at least once.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	From my wife Sarah: I see many negative reviews here, but we really liked this movie. Here's why:<br /><br />- It was simply very entertaining. It had several subtle changes to the Snow White story so that the movie kept us wondering what would happen next. The characters were much more complex than the fairy story, so much more interesting to watch. There was some action mixed with fantasy that made it exciting.<br /><br />- Actress Charlize Theron was absolutely amazing and her character was well scripted. She brought this movie up to a whole other level. She gave amazing depth to the character of the evil witch, and made her much more than a fairy tale figure.<br /><br />- It had a positive message ultimately.<br /><br />This is definitely worth seeing for adults, and I'd probably watch it again. However this is NOT for kids. The story is rather dark, and although not bloody, there's some intense violence and some nudity.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	this dvd was amazing  jeff dunham should definately do more for the public  i for one would buy them all  he is so funny its untrue  its a1
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Exciting, edge-of-seat action, PLUS a chance to explore with Indy again.  My family truly enjoyed the film, and hope that this same group will do an Indy 5.  This film has All new adventures, some old characters and some new!  And a little bit of mangled history.  Five thumbs up!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	received it in a timely fashion, and the DVD was in excellent condition~ brand new
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"I was really looking forward to watching this movie only to end up being disappointed.  This movie had a lot of hype and the previews looked really good.  The problem is the previews are about as good as it gets and the ending blew as did the action on the planet that was the supposed origin of humankind.  It was a poor repeat of an ""Alien"" series movie.  Rent it; don't buy it!"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is the best at what he does and this DVD puts it all together and makes you hope he does more.  We did not watch the censored version, but that is a nice option for those that want a little cleaner comedy.  Dunham is rarely vulgar, though.  Just humor in truth and using puppets to say what we wouldn't dare.  You catch yourself believing them--great work.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Extremely funny! Warning - do not view this DVD while attempting to eat or drink!
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"Expelled did not present any evidence supporting ID, Ben Stein just wasted an hour-and-a-half of my time saying ""EVOLUTION BAAADDDD!"" while beating his chest. Borrow Expelled from your library or stream it from Netflix for free, but don't waste your hard earned money on this shoddy movie."
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"I have just watched ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", and I can tell that, from my point of view, this movie is the kind of film that you will love if you have already read the books, but will not appreciate or understand too much if that is not the case. The reason for that opinion is that J. K. Rowling's books include lots of details that you don't get to enjoy in the movies, probably due to lack of time. That problem is more noticeable with the new movies, that try to stay faithful to the spirit of the books, and generally do so, but leaving many charming subplots behind, something I cannot help but regret.<br /><br />Thankfully, I've read all the books in the Harry Potter series so far, and plan on reading the last one next week. I can sincerely say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but that I wish it could have been longer.<br /><br />I would like to highlight the fact that the actors that play the main characters (Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson) keep getting better at their craft in each movie, and that the new director, David Yates, does an excellent job of trying to convey the gloomy mood of book 5, without losing the funny moments that make these books so special. The new additions to the cast were also excellent, specially Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and Helena Bonham Carter as a very scary Bellatrix Lestrange.<br /><br />On the whole, I highly recommend this movie, but I advise you to read the books first, because only then will you be able to enjoy the whole ""Harry Potter experience""  :)<br /><br />Belen Alcat"
B004JMSIRC	1.0	b	NEVER received item.  The seller, lola teacher, only replied to ONE of my messages,(I sent 4)  was rude, I never got a replacement or a refund, although I had requested a replacement.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	this is a must see for anyone that enjoys a good old fashioned belly laugh. this is some of the funniest stuff i have ever seen and would love to go a live show
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	This is a great movie!!! I'm very pleased with Robert Downy Jr., his performance was the best!!! Can't want for a second one, the chemistry between Robert and Gwyneth was awesome!!! And I love Terrence Howard!!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Just watched Iron Man in glorious Blu-ray HD and I am stoked. What a great movie that looks perfect for watching it in Blu-ray. The colors and definition of the picture is superb. Thanks Paramount!.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"i kept on hearing ""oh kirsten stewart ruins this movie"" ""she didn't pull off the role by a long shot""<br /><br />what the hell were they talking about?!?!?!?!<br /><br />this movie was pretty damn good as a whole, and the climax at the end was one of the best i remember seeing<br /><br />was it the best movie of 2012? no, not in my opinion.<br /><br />but regardless it was a good movie and not nearly as bad as some others made it out to sound"
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Some of the correlations between the Darwin Theory/Evolutionary Theory and The Nazis, Planned Parenthood, etc. blew my mind. It also makes you very aware that your freedoms are being taken away from you in the US, at a very alarming rate! Total Eye Opener! WOW.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I'm a hard sell when it comes to comedy.  A lot of today's comedy is too vulger and tasteless for me.  But along comes Jeff Dunham with material that's fresh and really funny.  Almost as clean as Bill Cosby and just as ingenius.  Great stuff!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Although the this seasons of True Blood is very different then the 'Dead Until Dark' book, it is still extremely entertaining and addicting.  I definitely recommend that any fan of the book or the show to watch the entire season.  The only thing that can hold me over until next season is going to be the dvd's!  So glad it is coming back to HBO for another (and hopefully more) round!
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	`The Departed' released in '06 is a hard-hitting cops and crooks American version of the wildly successful Chinese film `Infernal Affairs' from '02. Also like the Asian production, this American remake boasts an all-star cast to die for; Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg.<br /><br />It's an intense, hard-hitting and bloody drama that starts out like a sure Oscar contender with cutting edge, politically incorrect dialogue delivered in narrative form by Jack Nicholson. I was immediately excited by the prospects ahead and settled in for the gory ride, Good Guys versus Bad Guys, doesn't get any better than that. Unfortunately the storyline slowly begins to lose steam by the midway point of this 2 hour and 32 minute film and despite some brilliant performances, especially DiCaprio and Nicholson, when the conclusion finally arrives you're more than ready for the closing credits to roll by.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing, but not a classic.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	John Adams (HBO Miniseries) is an excellent series.  It is not only informative but entertaining.  Very well done!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Honestly, I loved this movie.  I would and I have recommended it to any family experiencing marriage problems.  I just wish that this movie would have been out before I got divorced.  I sincerely hate divorce, and I feel that this movie is a tool to show people how to turn their bad marriage around.  I feel that it is highly reflective on the Word of God about how a marriage should function, and it was also a very intense movie.  I will be honest that the first 20 minutes or so of the movie is really cheesy and poorly filmed.  However once you get past those first 20 minutes, you will see things like how pornography affects a marriage, how another man will vie for the love of your wife, how partners in marriage forget how to appreciate one another, how God is left in the background of a marriage, how some friends will give you secular answers to your marriage and will make it worse, etc.  Once all of these things are revealed, Godly answers are given about how to deal with the situation.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  I promise you if you have faced rough times in your marriage that this movie will bring you to your knees before God, and restoration of your marriage will soon follow.  God bless.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I saw Iron Man at the theaters so I pre-bought a copy of the DVD to enjoy again at home.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	How my ratings work:<br />5 - I really liked/loved it<br />4 - I liked it<br />3 - Could've been better/worth a look<br />2 - Just didn't live up to the potential<br />1 - Simply awful<br /><br />Sin City is one of the best comic book adaptations to come along in a while. I couldn't beleive how accurate it was to the books. It's also one of the most visually stunning films ever! The casting is pitch perfect, the entire cast does a great job. But Mickey Rourke steals the show as Marv. He's the ultimate street thug who'll take down anyone who get's in his way (and does half the time) to get his revenge. A must see for Frank Miller Fans, comic book fans, Robert Rodriguez fans, or people who just love good movies.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	"We enjoyed the DVD until it stopped playing because it was ""layered???""  We called SunCoast.  They said the DVD must be defective because it should have gone right to the next layer.  We just ordered another copy--not widescreen.  Hope it works...."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I love this product.  I'm an a 26 year old active duty soldier, currently serving in Iraq.  I have been using this workout for several months and have noted huge increases in flexibility, strength, and endurance.  Shaun T's high intensity workouts are great for anyone who wants to strengthen and tone while increasing their cardio endurance.  I love the fast pace of the Shaun's interval training technique, it keeps me challenged and motivated.  I have tried some other fitness products like  P90X.  I found the P90X to contain effective exercises, but overall the workouts were long, tedious, and boring compared to working out with Shaun T.  After using Insanity for ten weeks, I was so impressed that I ordered the deluxe upgrade kit to get three additional workouts(insane abs, sports training and weight training).  Also I like to incorporate small weights and medicine balls into some of the exercises to increase resistance.  My only warning would be that there are several exercises in this program which may be considered high impact.  Just make sure you follow Shaun's instructions for proper form and wear comfortable cross-training shoes. If you want to challenge yourself physically and are serious about getting in shape, this may be the workout for you.  There really  isn't any beginner video in this set, so be ready to hit it starting day one.  The first couple weeks may be tough for you depending on your current fitness level, but after that you won't be able to get enough of this workout.  This program is worth three times what it costs.  I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to maximize their fitness.
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	Show's ok.  But the discs were just a bit funky.  The skipped a couple times. And a couple times the disc just wouldn't work at all until I waited like 20 minutes and put it in again.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Jeff is a remarkable talent; while there are still some practitioners of this art, most bring a single character to the stage. Jeff's ""family""; Walter, Bubba J, Melvin, Achmed the dead terrorist, Jose' Jalapeno and of course, Peanut can bring an audience to its feet with every appearance. Just check his website and see the number of ""Sold Out"" performances or ""Extra Shows Added!"" You can pop this DVD in, watch the show or choose yoour favorite character and sit back and have a good laugh!<br />I highly reccommend this item."
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	I watched this movie because it stars my favorite actress Charlize Theron and she did great! It's just another popcorn movie for me.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	One of the best movies the summer of 08 gave us! Robert Downey Jr. has made an amazing come back to films. Jon Favreau has brought the armored avanger to life! The sequel will hopefully be just as amazing!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Iron Man is a really great movie. Robert Downey Jr. really steals the show with his superb acting job as Tony Stark/Iron Man by being absolutely hilarious all throughout and portraying his character perfectly. The film's soundtrack is also notable, full of electric guitar sound mixed with orchestrated stuff and it sounds great and fits the movie really well. The few action scenes in the movie are really cool, and although the final battle is a little underwhelming, the rest is really fun to watch. There are a lot of great, memorable lines and scenes throughout the movie too, my favorite part is probably when he blows up the tank, man that makes me laugh so hard. Add spectacular visual effects and a promised sequel and you get a movie no superhero film fan should miss, and people outside that category have good reason to enjoy it too.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"Iron Man is one of the more successful Marvel adaptations and Robert Downey Jr captures the carefree Tony Stark very well.<br />When he realizes that his company is supplying terrorists after his capture and the selfless help of his fellow prisoner who allows him to escape at the cost of his own life, Stark is a changed man.<br />His literal heart has some problems, which reflects the virtual heart that he develops during the course of the movie.<br />He is affected deeply and begins trying to use his vast fortune to try to alter the direction of his company.<br />However, Jeff Bridges' character is totally vested in the system and sets out to prevent a change in the power structure and eventually transforms from being mentor to foe. He fully inhabits this character and those familiar with his work will find him at first nearly unrecognizable, yet his acting talent is displayed to excellent effect.<br />He makes a surprisingly good villain, supplying the ""badness"" all heroes need as a foil to their ""goodness.""<br />The ending news conference is somewhat surprising, but on reflection, totally in character for the reckless Iron Man."
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	The product arrived right on time and in perfect condition. Buying the DVD didn't seem as rewarding the the blue ray would have been, because I feel shorted on the extras.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	It is now official that Robert Rodriguez will be releasing a full, 2-disc special edition copy of Sin City in early December. It will feature the film (theatrical version and a version in which the three tales can be viewed separately)and a disc of bonus features (ten minute cooking school, ten minute film school, a few commentaries, trailers, poster gallery, and a load of featurettes).<br /><br />So if your just looking for the theatrical version and nothing more, buy the featured DVD now. If your a fan, and want all of the nooks and crannies, I think you can hold out until late November or early December, trust me, it should be worth it.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB4W0W"">True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)</a><br /><br />This is an awesome show. And it was nice being able to not have to wait a week to see the next episode. Its a show about vampires trying to be accepted into society. There's ""mainstreamers"" which live among people. While the others still live amongst other vampires. I think its a really good show. And i'm glad i was able to get it on dvd. I couldn't really get it after it first came out because it was so expensive, but since i got it like a year late it came at a great cost :)"
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I enjoyed the movie, and though she has a long way to go, little miss Bella's acting was a step up. Other actors did a stellar job. A great dark fantasy addition to the genre of vampire/hunger games/avatar escapism movies we all enjoy so much.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"""The Departed"" will join director Martin Scorsese's other classic crime dramas, arguably on a par with ""GoodFellas"" in particular. This film easily swept the Academy Awards in 2007, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editor and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />This classic film is set in Boston, where two young police cadets( Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) are pulled into the web of betrayal and murder orchestrated by Irish crime boss Frank Costello (played by the legendary Jack Nicholson). The complex plot is based on the Hong Kong film ""Internal Affairs""(2002) of which ""The Departed"" is a remake. The film is packed with A-list talent; in addition to that mentioned above, the movie also stars Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg.<br /><br />The screenplay for ""The Departed"" is among the best ever written for a crime drama, it keeps the action moving at a fast clip and delivers clever dialogue alongside fantastic character development. Martin Scorsese won his first Academy award for Best Director for this picture; a well-deserved and long-delayed honor for one of America's greatest directors. It's easy to see why Scorsese won for this film, it is yet another brilliant expose of his masterful skill as a director.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson dominates this film. His performance as crime boss Frank Costello is brilliant and seems to come effortlessly to this living legend of the silver screen. The Costello character is ruthless and Machavellian to say the least, he ""adopts"" the young Colin character (Conor Donovan, played as an adult by Matt Damon) who grows up to join the Massachusetts State Police, thereby giving the crime boss an inside man within law enforcement, and the perfect ally to protect and expand his various rackets. From Nicholson's opening line, he outshines the other actors with screen presence alone, and then eclipses them altogether with his classic line deliveries.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio has grown to full maturity as a true A-List actor. His third collaboration with Scorsese (following 2002's ""Gangs Of New York"" and 2004's ""Tha Aviator"") as police cadet-turned-undercover cop Billy Costigan is perfectly performed, illustrating Scorsese's continued ability to draw out DiCaprio's best interpretations. Matt Damon revisits familiar territory as a South Boston cop, this role recalls his performance in ""Good Will Hunting"" complete with authentic Boston accent. Damon also works well under Scorsese, portraying the duplicitous, crooked cop Colin; his performance is sharp and well-balanced.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg's character Staff Seargent Dingnam is all wit and constant profanity, giving him the majority of the hilarious one-liners and zingers in this film. Martin Sheen provides a perfect counterbalance to Wahlberg's character as Chief Queenan. Providing further evidence of perfect casting is Alec Baldwin, who portrays Lieutenant Ellerby, the most crass and humorous of the veteran officers. Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing, authoritative Mr. French, Costello's most trusted enforcer.<br /><br />The music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film, providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets.<br /><br />""The Departed"" is a instant classic, a great movie for fans of gritty, violent crime dramas ala ""The Sopranos"". Scorsese continues to exhibit his mastery for this genre of film, his best work to date."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	THIS VIDEO NOT ONLY IS MOST INFORMATIVE IT CONFIRMS CONCERNS ABOUT CORPORATIONS AND THEIR FUNCTIONS.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	I have to say that I LOVE the book series and have read all of the ones written so far.  I cannot believe how awful the HBO series based on the books is.  I was so excited about the TV series based on the books but, I am sad to say I was so disappointed.  They took a great book series and turned it into a smutty, foul-mouthed TV show.  They have characters in the show that I do not even recall being in the books.  I usually never write reviews for things but, I felt I just had to leave one on this series.  The books are so good and I cannot believe that Charlaine Harris would want her books portrayed in this manner. I guess she is not bothered by it.  I wish that I could get my money back on the DVD's.  I will continue to read her books because she is such a good author but, I will just use my imagination and not watch the series.  My imagination is better.
B002QZ1RS6	3.0	b	I feel bad for those who are getting injured, it is  rather unfortunate ; but  you do realize that even swimming which is considered safest of all aerobic exercises will mess up your shoulder .. Or think about all  the potential of exchange of germs.  Weights make you stiff, running messes your knees, while cycling could get hit by a car and it works your legs only ... I mean you can find fault with any exercise program if you like. Just chose what works for you. This program is ok and does get you fit . I have lost nearly fifteen lbs after only three weeks. As one who has done cross fit, weights, running and boxing... I will let all those with one star rating complaining about injury that no matter what sport, exercise program you do, you will get injured even something as innocuous as golf.<br />The DVD sets come with warning to consult your physician before doing insanity. We all have different bodies and capabilities so I am not surprised that this does not work for everyone. Even those who say they did not lose weight ... I am sure they may have cheated on diet or if not maybe your body type just not go with  this diet plan...Dieting is a complex thing and to believe that one diet works for all of us is unrealistic . That is why I never go with diet plans I have my own plan (eat less, eat healthy, exercise more).<br />In conclusion, the reason I did not give it five stars and my advice is;<br />1. Exercises are too long... you can get better results for less time. However Shaun T does repeatedly ask you to rest and go at your pace ... don't try to keep to do evryth repetition ; i believe you can stil get results with a slower pace and less intensity. It is like weights if you went to the gym and saw everyone benching 300 lbs you would be foolish to try and keep up if you have never lifted above 100 lbs!! Exercise within your limits! Take it slow, dont be foolish follow the program but exercise wisdom and moderation.<br />2. Very little variety for stomach exercises: I think you will have to supplement with your own crunches.  Insanity does mostly planks<br />3.  Lots of jumping in insanity ... so get soft ground to jump on... avoid hard floors> leaping up and down on hard floors is asking for knee and back problems: be wise we are all built differently. OR just substitute jumping for something else like squats. Getting injured while jumping means that you knees cannot take you weight or your muscles are not strong enough .. so get into the rythm slowly dont be rush you may need more time.<br />4. Bottom LINE: Insanity is sixty day program... don't think it is long term. It's a good to have at home to change your routine. However have a long term plan after insanity. It's not for beginners CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR PEOPLE , before you begin. Devise your own diet plan
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"You know what kind of movie this is.  It's not King Lear, and it's not a science textbook.  Yes, it's a prequel (why is there even a debate about this?  Takes place in the same universe = prequel.)  I'm reading some of the negative reviews and I figure there must be something wrong with me, because the movie made perfect sense to me (well, except for the bit about the snakes.  There's always something.)  By ""making sense"" I don't mean ""good science,""  ""good science"" doesn't exist in science fiction movies, typically.  The quality of the acting is above average for most science fiction movies, and I'd say the actors playing the four most important characters (Shaw, Vickers, David, and Holloway) nailed their roles.  Visually, the film is excellent (except for the ""Star Wars prequel"" problem of prettier ships in an earlier time.)  My only complaint is that it didn't really feel like a Sci-Fi/Horror movie, but perhaps they weren't aiming for this, or perhaps I've become so desensetized that I don't recognize horror when I see it.<br /><br />The story is not complete, obviously.  It's likely they're planning for a trilogy.  I am sure the unanswered questions will be answered in subsequent films.  I am optimistic that this will less like the Matrix trilogy and more like the original Star Wars trilogy, minus the Ewoks.<br /><br />What's the best blockbuster of the year?  The Avengers, obviously."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I am finally thoroughly impressed with a Blu-Ray DVD. This is one to own if you want to see the full color sharpness of your 1080P tv. Can't say much for the sound as I don't have a receiver hooked up yet.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"This movie is great!  Everything fell together perfectly.  The cast, soundtrack, dialogue, location...everything!  I'm not going to repeat the synopsis that is given above.  Just know that you can enjoy the movie even if you're not a big Dicaprio buff. Even if you despise him, you'll still love this flick. The final scene had everyone in the theatre yelling ""woah""!"
B001OHS8BQ	3.0	b	"I watched this film primarily to see if I could recommend it to my own son. It was very affecting until the point where the father tells his son that the only way to succeed in his efforts was to become ""saved.""<br /><br />I knew it was a Christian film. Although I am not Christian, I have always believed in taking wisdom wherever I found it, as long as it didn't contradict my own beliefs. To say that marital success depends on being Christian, goes over the line, and deprives others -- Jews, Muslims, non-believers -- of the opportunities presented by this otherwise excellent program."
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	This is not your childs Disney movie for sure. But a more adult version of the classic snow white tail with a evil witch queen. Much more action then expected and good action at that. Special effects were good and not to over powering. All in all a good movie, not 5 stars but a solid 4 stars. Again its an adult version of a kids classic so one can't expect to much or can you?
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	I am the kind of viewer who, when looking at films with plot twists and turns and double crossings back and forth, gets very very confused.  This movie is obviously great ... I've looked at it 3 times already and I still don't get it.  But I can tell it's quality.  Too bad I can't come back and rate it again after the 7th viewing.  If you enjoy plot twists and the kind of movie you have to pay close attention to, this is it.  It definitely has a lot of action.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	So often we find a serie of movies, bookes and programs that we follow from start to end. The Harry Potter movies are abosolutly wonderful, well directed and written for all ages.<br /><br />As a fan, I own all of these series and am more than pleased.
B004JMSIRC	2.0	b	"I've heard how great this movie is for months.  So I finally get to see it...and it seemed like 2 hours before he finally got the damn suit on.  Pretty slow build-up there.  Also the ""villain"" was...nobody.<br /><br />Good news is Robert Downey Jr. was FANTASTIC as a playboy, pompous businessman, monkeying around with the suit, sitting eating a burger during the ""change of heart"" press conference etc.  The tension between him as Bond and Paltrow's MoneyPenny (or whatever the hell her name is) was believable too.<br /><br />But once it gets building up to the climax...I really stopped caring.  Particularly when the final battle ends of being a blatant, BLATANT rip-off of the final battle in RoboCop 2.  If you didn't see that one, what happens is little RoboCop ends up fighting a much larger Robot with a gatling gun on his right arm...and later ends up on his back, piggy-back style, destroying it.<br /><br />Sound familiar?<br /><br />Christ people...would it kill you to write something original?<br /><br />So I recommend RoboCop 2 (and the orignal of course).  That one's not afraid to splatter blood all over too, instead of G-rating the action for the kiddies."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	My kids love this movie - but so do my husband & I. Just a great movie!!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Do not miss this series! Alan Ball and Charlaine Harris are both so talented individually - as a team, they are simply the best!
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	This is the first one I had seen and I could not help but to order the dvd before this one. It is FUNNY!
B005ZMUQCK	2.0	b	"Cars was the first Pixar production to disappoint me. For a family with no interest in automobiles or racing or Nascar, the film had little to offer.<br /><br />The characters weren't anything new. An arrogant lead (who never grew on me), a hick, a fiesty businesswoman type...these are all characters that have been done before. Where were the totally new ideas, like Dory the forgetful fish and Flik the inventor ant?<br /><br />The plot was a transparent recycling of ""Doc Hollywood"", completely devoid of surprises. The audience knew from the moment Lightning McQueen arrived in town, that he would eventually come to love Radiator Springs. And personally, since I didn't care about the characters, the race held no suspense for me at all. It simply didn't matter who won or lost.<br /><br />Aside from a couple of isolated moments of humor, I didn't even laugh until the John Ratzenberger scenes during the credits.<br /><br />I'm sure the film was a lot of fun for John Lasseter to make, but it wasn't as fun for those of us who don't share Lasseter's love of cars."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"I am not going to rehash the plot of the movie the way WAY TOO MANY reviewers do these days.  Instead I am going to give you all you need to know.  Go watch this film!  It is BY FAR the BEST Marvel presentation to date.  Granted, the original story was ""updated"" for the current audience, but the major points of the story remain the same. While I enjoyed Spiderman, I am just not sure who decides which villains to place in movies these days.  That is my only fear for Iron Man 2 (which I am sure is coming).  However, the first one, without a major super-villain was A BLAST.  WHY?  Becasue it actually told a story and didn't get caught up in trying to create an adversary for the hero...it actually focused on the hero.  What  novel concept!  Way to go Marvel and everyone else involved.  You got this one right!  This one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"Amazon isn't Rotten Tomatoes nor IMBD, so I'm not reviewing the movie, I'm reviewing the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />""This title will be released on October 11, 2012"" - yet again, the industry is still failing to realize that people don't want to wait for the ""treat"" like rats in a maze - and then they wonder why so many commit the indecent crime of illegally downloading content?<br /><br />Prometheus is out of the theaters at this time, apparently. So why isn't the HD digital copy available? How is this mandatory waiting period a good business model, for anyone in their right mind?<br />To the old folks running the MPAA: wake up. Make this movie available for HD streaming rental/permanent download already, and you'll make money with downloads. No one cares that you still want to use physical copies. It's only your fault that you take time accepting new technologies. Physical discs are wasteful in this day and age. Make it available for purchase as an option for people who want to own the disc (me included)."

B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	I've been waiting for this one.  So good!  I'm a big fan of the Alien saga, and I am very pleased with the way Prometheus turned out.  I've had friends of mine say that they were disappointed with the lack of fright that the Alien series gave us, and I agree that it wasn't scary.  But Ridley Scott took questions of evolution versus creation to a whole new level (at least on the big screen).  All-star cast, sweet action, and special effects that put the old Alien movies to shame.  Prometheus is not for everyone, but I can't wait to watch it few hundred more times.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Fun and funny movie with heart.  Familiar story lines but using cars as the main characters makes it interesting.  Enjoyable for adults as well as kids.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Snow White and The Huntsman was a good movie we really enjoyed watching it- since we could not seem to get to the movie theatre while it was playing.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	this is a cute movie and it to funny and some parts are sad but all in all its a very good movie for the kids to watch
B00447G29S	4.0	b	This is a great movie. The 3D really looks great even at home.  You may want to purchase some decent 3D glasses though.  The movie comes with some of those cheap paper deals, but you can get some good ones online for less that 10 bucks.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I started reading the book series before watching the first season. Each Season is equivalent to a book. The tv show is great and addicting, My sister and I couldn't stop watching, and everyone who I introduced the DVDs to got hooked right away. The only downside about the TV series, is that it is ALOT different from the books, it seems like they just kept the main characters and there characteristics the same and change the story line. It is still a great show and worth buying, but I still perfer the books.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	Jeff Dunham is hilarious.  His alter egos are a great pleasure to watch and listen to.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I am definitely a Harry Potter fan who loves the books AND the movies.  I don't care what they change in the movie, as long as the story works overall.  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite of the movies released so far.  It was the longest book turned into the shortest movie, and I thought it really worked well.  The young adult actors were spot on in this film, and the rest of the distinguished adult cast were wonderful, as usual.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	But in my opinion you failed . M, buddy, you had such a good premise, and fifty minutes in, I was going to my friends, this kicks ::Tail::, and then, Boom, a major char. Gets offed. It was like X-men 2 all over again. But it,(all of the charm of the movie) was all gone. I am going to give you a couple of stars for those first 50 minutes, those were excellent. Bryce Dallas Howard saved the movie from being a total disappointment. The twist was one we had figured out in 15 minutes. I don't mean to be hurtful, but I like to be scared half-way out of my skull(Reason I loved Sixth Sense and Signs. You really scored points from me when you made unbreakable, mainly because I am a comic book feind)And with a heavy heart I must say, Sorry, but until you make another movie that has the goods I won't see this one again.<br />  Breakdown:<br />  Story: 2 1/2<br />  Scenery:5<br />  Charachters:3<br />  Music: 4<br />  Sound:4<br />  Ending:1<br />  Creatures:2
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This guy is so funny and his 5 characters are a blast!! He is a master at ventriliquism for sure. I may buy a bunch more to give as gifts. There is an option on the dvd to have the censored or unsensored version to satisfy the audiences taste...very nice. You have to buy it....it is very funny!!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Not being a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, I thought this movie would be bad.  On the contrary.  This is the role that Downey Jr. was born to play!  The movie is not only good it is one of the best action films to come out in years!  Everybody cast was perfect from Terrance Howard as Tony Stark's military friend, to Gwyneth Paltrow as a very sexy version of Pepper Potts (Stark's fawning and overprotective Administrative Assistant).<br /><br />Stark is a wild playboy genius who reminds me of the Mozart character in Amadeus.  After being almost killed by a mine explosion from one of his own company's weapons, Stark becomes a changed man who is more interested in saving the world than creating weapons.  Unfortunately his evil partner and mentor, Obadiah Stane has other ideas.<br /><br />The action is great and Iron Man's suit is very believable.  It is amazing to see Stark dressed by robot helpers and to see how the armor goes on.<br /><br />Warning - Make sure you stay past the end of the credits or you will miss an important few minutes of added story that will set up the movie continuation and also introduce a familiar face.

B000H7I6CU	3.0	b	Great Family Movie, great family fun.<br /><br />My daughter loves this movie, I prefer the 2nd myself as it has a cool james bond feel to it.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	"Bored.  I can't remember waiting for a movie to end for so long.  There was disappointment, but mostly boredom.  Might I add that there is little less credible in the world than Kristen Stewart's armored Snow White wielding sword.<br /><br />Another misleading trailer.  I thought I was in for a contemporary fairy tale with epic action.  Instead I yawned my way through two hours as Kristin ""the one-look-Zoolander"" Stewart sulked her way through another over-produced, underwritten movie with an emotionally bewildered expression which begs the question did somebody just fart?  [End rant]<br /><br />This really ""could"" have been epic.  Many snippets, scenes and concepts/ideas were excellent; it's just that many others were not.  The opening winter scene was stark, but oh so powerful (most memorable of the movie, I'd say).  But then it was largely followed by scenes shot too close up to enjoy the storybook grandeur.  However it wasn't all bleakly shot.  Formidable castlescapes impressed and the brilliant enchanted forest reminded me that there was some serious insight behind this film's production while also breaking the lowlight gray color palate of the scenes from The Dark Forest and the dungeon-like castle.  The fairy forest was like Ferngully meets Pandora, filled with all manner of enamoring CGI flora and fauna.  Conversely, the fairies seemed like something out of a Saturday morning children's show as if they were thrown together at the last minute before the movie's release.  These are but few examples of the inconsistent quality throughout the film.<br /><br />I thought this would be an action/adventure movie.  But it didn't feel like one.  The chthonic troll was my favorite critter.  But the action (i.e., between the troll and the huntsman) was brief, ill-imagined and ultimately anticlimactic.  The queen's glasswork soldiers are cool early in the movie as they shatter in slo-mo on the battlefield, but the scene is all about the effects and not about the action.  During the finale, these minions are animated semi-humanoid blobs of glass shards which move so fast you can't tell what they're doing.  I wish I could unsee that scene.  In general, the action in this movie was like poor quality background noise.  It was never the focus of any one scene, but it was always too distracting to ignore.  Anyone expecting Lord of the Rings quality sword fights or man-versus-creature bouts would likely be disappointed.<br /><br />Really, Charlize Theron's queen made for the best moods and moments.  Her wardrobe was creatively architected to look both painfully donned and elegant while royal with trappings of the macabre.  At times her acting may come off as a bit extreme, but hey--she ""is"" playing an evil aging witch queen obsessed with youth and power.  You could feel her desperation, pain, flagging sanity...oh yeah, and evil.  The best effects were cast on the queen's sorcery as she shifts form in disguise and agonizing aging.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth portrayed the right character the right way, but with the wrong lines, weak character development and no heroic scenes.  His action scenes either focus little on his character (rather the whole battle or situation) or result in him getting his butt kicked.  They also made the huntsman a depressed alcoholic widower, but offer little to justify his convenient noble transformation throughout the movie.  The dwarves, who in three minutes quickly shift from murderous rogues to stalwart allies, were really only as interesting as the actors you recognized behind the odd haircuts and facial prosthetics--namely Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane, Nick Frost and Toby Jones.  They offer little to lighten the mood, in fact often distracting from the tone with too many weak lines, frequent and ineffective attempts at comic relief, and way too much screen time. Oh, right, and the ""Prince"" guy (William) felt like a completely needless character.<br /><br />Stacked upon all this is that a lot of things go unexplained.  Just because you can get away with that in a kid's fairy tale doesn't mean you can do that with the adult contemporary version.  I'm complaining a lot here, but the movie isn't necessarily to be skipped.  Many of the effects and scenes would be far more enjoyable on the big screen (or at least a large HDTV) with surround sound.  Just don't make a Friday night event out of it--save it for a rainy Sunday afternoon.  A portion of these scenes, effects and ideas are why I say this movie ""could"" have been epic.  The skill set was there.  But the writing wasn't--in terms of story fluidity and dialogue, that is.  But hey, this was director Rupert Sanders' first film.  For a first job, and one of such magnitude, he showed some serious imaginative chops...he just didn't do so consistently.  Keep an eye out for him in the future.<br /><br />WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD:  I'm going to go way out on a limb here and say that The Brotherhood of the Wolf (2001) accomplished what this film was trying to.  Not your style?  Then I'd wind back the clock for some nostalgic darker fantasy fun.  How about Legend (1985), Labyrinth (1986), The Dark Crystal (1982), Wizards (1977), The Last Unicorn (1982), The Whiz (1978) or Return to Oz (1985).  Too old for you?  Then why not just aim for LOTR."
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	I'm a Harry fan so the product was as expected.  But, the service was the treat.  I placed an advance order and had the DVD in my mail on the release date.  I didn't even have to wait an extra day to get it.  Great Service.  I love advance ordering!
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	These are impressions I typed up after seeing it last weekend.<br /><br />- Overall Rating:  8.5/10<br /><br />5 of us went, and we went to a restaurant after and talked about it for an hour.  After we did I asked for ratings out of 4.<br /><br />Me - 3.5/4 (I upped my review above to 8.5/10 which is close to 3.5/4.<br />Wife - 3.5/4<br />Brother - Initially said 4/4, then backed off to 3.5/4<br />Male friend - 3.5/4<br />Female friend - 3.5/4.  This one blew me away, because I thought she would HATE this movie.  It's not up her alley AT ALL.  She said she liked it because it was tense and adult, not like Avatar.  Those were her words.  I asked her about the xenosnake going down the guys throat (she was squirming like crazy during that part) and she said she loved it.  Go figure.<br /><br />- Awesome FX, great 3D, amazing design, amazing filming/cinematography.  No debate there.<br />- The main story is pretty simplistic, it parallels Alien (and unfortunately AVP).  The difference is the whole spiritual subplot...and I think that needed some more work.<br />- Needed more engineer action IMO.  They were under utilized.  The surviving engineer is barely in the movie.  The engineers were in the first and last shot of the movie but kind of ignored as the central antagonist of the movie.  Really disappointed in this aspect of the movie.<br />The xeno scene at the end was both necessary and completely unnecessary at the same time.  I really wouldn't have cared one bit if they'd never tied this to Alien at all.  I was perfectly willing to keep this completely separate.<br />- I still maintain that the central story is about Weyland even though he's barely in it.  Everything David does is because of Weyland.  David has no agenda or motivation beyond that.  Everything Vickers does is to defy her father.<br />- The motives of Holloway and Shaw are secondary (yet more interesting, and left mostly unexplored and fleshed out).  I'm hoping the sequel will explore this side of it more since Shaw seemed damned determined to find out.  I wished they had focused on either Weyland's quest for immortality OR Shaw's quest for the mysteries of life/creation.  Mixing them together led to both being muted.<br />- I found the acting to be pretty solid (Fassbender stands out as everyone has said).  There are bad lines, but that's not the fault of the acting.<br />- I find movies that create questions to be just as satisfying as those that spoon feed us the answers.  The Fountain is like this.  A million questions but I still liked it.  Prometheus is in the vein.<br />- Fox marketing really screwed the pooch on the trailers.  They DID show way too much.  The viral aspects have been brilliant though.<br />- I think this movie was cut in the hope of a PG-13 rating, and they barely missed it.  I assumed there was way more gore and horror than was shown in the trailers.  But there isn't.  Which begs the question...why can we see almost all the gore and horror in the trailers yet it gets an R rating?  I think a lot of good bits are sitting on hard drives somewhere.<br />- Wanted:  Extended director's cut.<br /><br />- Lastly...I will never spoil myself as bad as I have on this movie...ever...again.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a little less than I had expexted as far as quality and content.
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	"This was one movie I couldn't wait to have, so I pre-ordered.  Movie is perfectly acted, violent, and graphically beautiful.<br /><br />This DVD, however, comes with almost NO extras.  Spend the extra US$5 and get the ""Uncut, super-duper, extended"" version."
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	"After reading several other reviews of Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, I was pleased to learn that I was not the only disappointed fan.  As an avid HP fan, it was torture to sit through this movie and not complain.  Even my 8 year old son, who loves all things Harry Potter looked at my husband and I after 45 minutes and said ""Is it supposed to be this boring?"".  The problems with the film are numerous, however, the lack of MAGIC in the first half of the movie ruined the entire experience for me.  I have no problem overlooking the incongruities between the book and the movie, but this movie stepped too far outside the lines of the text. I have one other problem with this movies...I have to buy it because I refuse to have an incomplete DVD collection.  Here's hoping Amazon sells it at a really great price!"
B001KEGR8Y	1.0	b	It is a shame, truly a shame that this man's 'act' deserves one single special, let alone four.  This man is a ridiculously unfunny hack relying on only the most played out stereotypes and overtly stupid material.  I am sure that if he could make anyone laugh without a puppet in his hand he would, just as if most children's book writers would write for adults if they could.  This is pandering garbage, pure and simple.  Anyone with just an average intelligence (which is dropping all the time it would seem) knows beyond the shadow of a doubt that this is unfunny drivel.  The fact that anyone could enjoy this is absurd to me, yet I know that so many do.<br /><br />Does anyone else remember his short lived television show? Would anyone care to tell me why such a funny comedian couldn't hack it for one entire season before being canned?  That is proof positive that at least some segment of the population still has enough sense to change the channel when they see some moron with a doll up on stage... a glimmering hope for America which is slowly receding into the distance.  Please, I am begging anyone who agrees with me to give this 1 star.  Help me make it clear that we still have a collective sense of humor beyond goofy voices and thinly veiled racism.  If you will excuse me, I have to go now because someone is jingling keys over my head and I need to laugh and smack at it like a cat.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Nothing prepared me for this movie; I didn't read the book.  Tommy Lee Jones and the Cohen Bros. were my only draw.  I like going into a movie that way, nothing given away in the trailor. I had some pre existing ideas, after all it's a Cohen perspective. I sat down expectling ""quirky"", but the Cohen's had better than that in store for me.<br />Javier Bardeem is strangely handsome, even with the now famous haircut, but something quietly dark throws me off any assumptions I want to make about this silent type.  I know the movie is about drugs, greed, and integrity.  But along the way I learn that it's so much deeper than anything I expected.  It's the world layed out for us in the most base, cruel and vial format, where men not only don't have a heart, they walk the earth without a soul, guided by the most animal instincts a human body could possess on two legs.  There is no rhyme or reason to the killings for Bardeem. It seems he sets his sights on what he's hired to do and nothing, nothing gets in his way. He flips a coin, you live or die; it appears to be his only entertainment.  From his point of view, he's a man of his word; it's everything to him and the strength he draws from that conviction is what appears to keep him going.  He doesn't struggle with who he is, he already knows, and has no qualms about doing what he does to anyone, or the cost to himself. He's a terminator. The irony of the cattle gun, as his weapon of choice, is not lost here.  There is no interest in torture, just the swift shot to the brain and you're gone; not a seconds thought is wasted on it.<br />Tommy Lee, just the opposite of morality.  Hard working man of law, he gets the way it's always been, the futility of life in the desert, the circumstances with which he faces every day knowing undoubtadly the evil of man will not ever end.<br />Josh Brolin is the conduit that brings all the characters together.  He's a little of both men, which isn't easy.  He's certainly willing to gamble with his life and every aspect of it.<br />Every scene connects seamlessly and I can say without a doubt, that this movie stayed with me for days, believing this cold blooded darkness is alive and well in the world.<br />It is also my pick for the Best Movie Oscar. I will purchase my copy when released.  Best movie of the year, and it wasn't easy with all the great films for this Oscar rating."
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"This really is getting ridiculous. Half the reviews on this site are blasting these Ultimate Editions because they don't have what people are calling ""The Extended Editions"". You do realize that the Extended Editions that all you guys are talking about, the ones shown on ABC Family, are just the regular movies with the Deleted Scenes thrown in. That is all they are. You really can't just watch the Deleted Scenes on their own, and be happy? You have to have them haphazardly thrown into the movie to be happy? It is really just sad, and yes, I realize that there are probably hours of other scenes that was left on the cutting room floor, but if that is the case then it truly is up to the directors to re-cut the film and add things in. That is not the fault of Warner Brothers, it is the director's choice. So yeah, while it sucks that the directors didn't re-cut the movies and make them better, the films are pretty awesome as they are anyways. Besides, the real reason to get this is for the hour long documentary on each one. That is what makes these editions truly Ultimate."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"I would recomend this dvd for anyone who loves comadie and ventrilquism.  Jeff Dunham is so funny, not to mention with all his ""cohorts"" dummies.  I would not show this to young children.  There is a lot of language that would not be great for their ears."
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	I saw this film in theaters and loved it. It was not as good as Alien but it was worth a theatrical viewing. If you like Sci Fi and breathtaking images, well then this film is for you. Some of the acting was great:Example: Michael Fassbender. Some of the other actors performances were good too, but, not as well as his. The blu ray is excellent with over 7 hours of bonus material. The 4 disc collector's edition is the one to buy. Pay the extra 5 dollars. Can't really say anything more. Such a great release for a Ridley Scott film.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	We all have enjoyed these Indiana Jones movies. They have always entertained and seem to capture a little bit of our cultural hero worship for the good guy fighting the evil forces pretty well. This time around it's an intrigue with the meaning of the Crystal Skulls being the mystery to unravel. This movie is a nice exit for Indy as he has this one last adventure. It's been a good franchise for all concerned and we all happily live his adventures vicariously. This one is pretty good and gives this classy guy a nice sendoff while setting up what may be the new Indy in Shia Lebouef.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	We all love this video, when you've had a bad day, just pop this jewel into the dvd player, and laugh yourself silly.
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	There is no denying this movie's technical and stylistic excellence, but Sin City is a pretentious film noir wannabe. It takes gratuitous violence to uninspired levels of depravity, and it pretends at a plot by interweaving multiple storylines and characters, all of which is too clever by half and amounts to a house of cards. This is a movie in which every male character is either a killer or a cop (sometimes both), and every female character is a Black Belt prostitute. Almost nothing makes sense, so you must watch the film as a pure sensory experience - albeit a very gruesome one. Some characters possess supernatural powers; we never discover why. I liked Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, but even though Sin City adopted elements of those two films, I absolutely hated it. If viewing two hours of violence and torture is your idea of entertainment, then by all means, see this movie. If it is not, stay away. At best, you will feel bored; at worst, you will feel disgusted. This film creates a new genre: The Sadomasochistic Fantasy.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Quick shipping & the bonus of free super savings shipping.  The Blu-Ray high def quality & thumping Bass in the soundtrack made this a fun movie night @ home.  For those of you with kids or who are kids @ heart.....Buy It!!
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	"First, let me say that Sin City is the type of movie I normally love to watch---a gritty crime drama that doesn't shy away from realistic language, violence and adult situations in order to create a dark, moody atmosphere.  Second, let me add that I like everyone involved with this film.  I think most of the actors are great, I like just about everything Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino have ever done, and I admire Frank Miller's writing.<br /><br />The bad news, then?  This movie just wasn't very good.<br /><br />The main draw of the film is that it's made to look like a comic book come to life, and in that sense it's a success; the visuals are darkly stunning, and the whole film is, overall, ""cool"" to watch, for want of a better word.  Unfortunately, though, this film is mainly nothing but cliches and tired old story lines about crooked cops, hookers with a heart of gold and rugged detectives that we've seen a million times.  The dialogue is laughably bad and the actors seem stiff and wooden delivering it; you almost feel like you're watching your local middle school putting on a dramatic adaptation of some 1940s black-and-white gangster movie.<br /><br />The movie also goes way, way, way over the top with the violence.  I can watch just about anything and not be bothered, but this film was basically a two-hour barrage of heads being chopped off, men being shot (or stabbed) in the crotch, and other men being turned into swiss cheese by bullets.  When you can't go more than five minutes without showing a bloody killing, you know you've run out of ideas as a filmmaker.<br /><br />Overall, this is the type of movie that 12-year-old boys would see and go ""Wow!  Neat!"", but they're the last people in the world who should watch a film like this.  My advice to everyone else is to watch it once, admire the movie's innovative style, overlook all of its flaws, then forget about it."
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	"I love Jack Nicholson, which is the only reason I picked up this film.<br /><br />The Departed takes much too long to get started. The first 45 minutes could be clipped down to 20 to improve pacing. The profanity was stunning. I'm not a prude, but after the first 20 minutes I thought about just turning it off.<br /><br />That's a shame, because the final 20 minutes of the film are fantastic - a bloody conclusion worthy of crime film fans. The camera work is good, and so is the acting. There were some plot holes that could have been filled had they focused on that, rather than winning the Guinness Book's record for using the ""f"" bomb.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's character had the BEST lines, though. I got a good laugh out of several of them."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Trying to find this movie out of season is difficult and to find it at this great price with free S/H is a no-brainer purchase. In fact I went back and bought a second copy.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This movie is so thought provoking that I've decided to send copies to everyone I know. It is really eye-opening to discover where our food is coming from and why this nation's continues to pack on the pounds.<br /><br />Many parts made me angry; others made me sad. Overall, it's definitely changed how I view food -- what I eat and chose to buy. This documentary should be shown in schools, at town hall meetings and on regular television.<br /><br />I, for one, will be contacting my Congress people to demand some changes because if things continue down the same path, America is in big trouble!
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	I didn't expect much due to the reviews but I at least thought it would be visually interesting. A lackluster boring waste of time.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I have been a big fan of Jeff Dunhams material for years and he just gets better and better if you want to laugh this works!
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	The stories are getting darker and the actors are getting older and not as cuit as they used to be.  The first one is still the best in the series. Lots of good extras.  Amazon sent it on time and at a very good price.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	My bride (of 34 years) and I have seen the movie multiple times.  I purchased it as a 'gift' for our newly married son and daughter-in-law as they were going through the 'post-honeymoon' rough patch.  The gift seems to be a contributor to getting them 'back' on the right road to a maturing marriage based upon love - for God and one another.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	Pixar just can't make a bad movie.  They manage to make children's movies enjoyable for everyone while having adult undertones. This would have gotten 5-stars but the gitrdone killed it for me. Other than that one caveat, buy it.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"Hard to believe this movie is so revered. It's been done. In fact it's a checklist of pretty much every scifi movie ever made...the entire run of this was so nostalgic, from bringing an alien specimen on board (which is always a bad idea, and has a predictable outcome) to the indispensable robot who in the end is the one man for the job.. are people really this forgetful? The casting, other than the Bishop/Aliens ripoff were simply not memorable. I didn't identify with or care about ANY of these characters -- even WITH their names plastered unnecessarily on their heads.<br /><br />Spoilers --<br /><br />Lets not even mention the giant continuity problems like the scientist lady who bares some type of octopus formed alien, then the Borg looking ""baddie"" alien (who shares our EXACT DNA so therefore should produce an identical style alien) bares a -- wait for it -- classic alien model just in time for the credits.<br /><br />I wouldn't necessarily say skip this movie, but you've seen it. It has some impressive visual effects for someone who has never played a modern videogame, but it lacks any sort of soul and the script could definitely use a strong central character..but I suppose when you've cast 9 unlikeable actors - who would you choose?<br /><br />PS - couldn't they find an OLDER actor to play the part of the old man? The ""old guy"" visuals looked really poor..and they kept out someone who possibly could have made this film seemed a little more grounded.<br /><br />''Hi---- I'm REALLY OLD. I want to find an alien species because they MUST KNOW how to stop aging -- even though I have no proof they know anything of the kind.. if they even exist AT ALL.""<br /><br />''HI, I'm hot and blonde and my dad is 75 years older than I am.""<br /><br />did anyone watch the movie -- or just the holographic pretty lights?<br /><br />""Hi, I signed up for a mission I didn't know didn't allow guns -- apparently we never discussed the parameters of the mission."""
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"I think a lot of reviews missed the point of this chapter of the Potter Saga. Harry and the rest of the students are growing up. Harry's glum bitter mood is appropriate for his age and the constant stress of his life. Readers of the books will be aware of this. The instalments grow up with the cast. If J.K. Rowling and/or the films producers would have kept the ""Disneyesque"" tone of the earlier books it would have become derivitive and boring. The cutting of many of the sub plots was needed otherwise we would have been watching a 3 hour plus film."
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	Great!  Has it all!  Comedy, romance, mystery and a lot of old time 'shoot-em-ups'.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Great DVD for adults. Not suitable for children under 14. I have watched this more than once since my purchase. I can't wait until Jeff comes out with a new DVD.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I have in the title from a ""female"" point of view because I've noticed that many of the reviews I read about this movie that were aweful was from a woman and that they claim that this was mostly a movie for guys because of the nudity and violence.  Well, I'm here to say that I'm a woman and I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  I thought the acting was awesome, the effects were brilliant, and the story line was great.  I do have to say though, that this is not a movie for people that don't care for excessive violence and nudity.  As for people like me who love gore, violence, and a great creative story line, this is right up your alley.  Please keep a very open mind for this movie if you had no idea what the comic book was about."
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	...they nailed it.  As cool as the film was, that grey armour...clumsy, heavy, brutal...was the absolute true representation of a hero's outfit as portrayed in the comic.  We'll never see Wolverine in yellow, but we got Iron Man in grey.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	the special effects were great, and good acting all around, save Kristen Stewart, since I can't conceive why she'd be cast with someone as incredibly talented as Charlize Theron.  Good thing she didnt have to do much, because she's really not much of an actress. Storyline was ok, I think it could have been done better, but it's easy to be critical when you're not making it happen. worth watching, all in all. A good escape from the troubles of today's world.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Snow White and the Huntsman is a refreshing look at movie fairly tales, much closer to the literary stories than the sanitized Disney versions. The film keeps the basic story of an evil witch and the purity of Snow White while adding a sinister forest with a deadly troll and an enchanted fairy inhabited forest.  The dwarves are also part of the film, played by Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, Bob Hoskins and Toby Jones, among others, filmed in close-ups with dwarf stand-ins used for long shots.  They provide comic relief and fight heroically for Snow White.<br /><br />Charlize Theron as Ravenna gives a marvelous performance as Snow White's evil stepmother, who kills her husband King Magnus on their wedding night and seizes the throne for herself.  She clearly relished the role. On the other hand, Chris Helmsworth (as the Huntsman) and Kristen Stewart (Snow White) do not connect emotionally and their relationship never catches fire. Kristen Stewart does not bring a lot of passion to her role. She does a good job looking the part of a princess but it was disappointing at the end of the film when Snow White is crowned, looking regal, but has no lines to say to sum up her character. The film, at over two-hours long, moves rather slowly and there was a couple of scenes that I found could have been cut without harming the plot.<br /><br />Perhaps the real star of Snow White and the Huntsman are the special effects, costumes and cinematography.  The film production is beautiful with the design of the forest, enchanted garden and castle adding to make the story much more engaging.  The score by James Newton Howard captures the mood of the film very well. I found Snow White and the Huntsman refreshing take on a well-known fairy tale despite the film being a bit slow.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"There's nothing I can add to what others have written here, other than to give my personal impressions.<br /><br />I hate scary movies that jerk me around. My wife doesn't. She absolutely loves ""Signs,"" which I acknowledge is a very well-crafted story, but I don't like the way it jams my nervous system.<br /><br />So when she decided we needed to see ""The Village,"" I went along for the ride mostly just to humor her. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The thing I like most about M. Night's storytelling is his ability to surprise and he delivers again with ""The Village.""<br /><br />After you've seen the film once, you can go back and pick up some subtle clues about the surprise ending, but I doubt if one in 100 viewers figures it out the first time through.<br /><br />It's a classy movie with an strong cast and, even though I won't want to watch it as often as my wife will, I think it's well worth the price of the DVD."
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	I have been doing P90X for about 2 years now and felt that I was in decent shape at 47 y.o.  I started with the Fit Test (day 1) of the Insanity.  They show you a few moves you will be doing throughout the program.<br /><br />So Day 2 starts with the Plyo Cardio Circuit.  I found that many of the moves were extremely dangerous.  I actually slightly pulled a hamstring because there was no stretching at the beginning.<br /><br />I think Insanity is more like the Crossfit where the exercises are violent to the point of injury.<br /><br />The advantage of P90X is that you ALWAYS stretch before exercising.<br /><br />I think Insanity is more for age 30 and under.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would categorize it as an instant sci fi classic for the home collection.<br /><br />While there are those who enjoy finding fault in the details, I allow myself to be pleasantly entertained by the fantasy.  Known physics render sci fi movie plots impossible. Seems silly to accept that light speed is real but assume future medicine can't allow a woman to have an alien surgically removed then go all ""warrior princess"" a few minutes later.  For all those who want to get picky....  this movie can't even be prequel.  If the Prometheus crew left earth about seventy years from now and traveled 2.5 years at faster than light speed (Wyland files on BlueRay disc reference ship's FTL drive), then the Aliens saga as we know it from the first movies would have concluded hundreds of thousands if not millions of years before Prometheus even lands on that Engineer's moon.  Time becomes infinite at light speed.  Even at near light speed 2.5 years to the crew might be millions of years to everything outside the craft.  Assuming the Engineer traveled back to earth to destroy us(yet another million or more years in the future) I think he might find his old-school tech laughable to us our highly evolved society.  So don't let the ""that's not possible"" or ""that's stupid"" arguments deter you from kicking back and enjoying the ride.  I choose to let Prometheus deliver.  I hope you do too.<br /><br />I will say this... the extended/deleted scenes should have been better integrated in the blue ray edition.  They are viewable separate from the movie and add a lot of wonderful context about the opening scene and offer a dialogue between David and the Engineer.  All of which were cut to satiate momentum.  I would love to have the option of seeing them included in the main movie.  Maybe the director's cut will suffice."
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	I realize that some things must change when you adapt a book to the big screen, but what was done to this particular book is appalling. Over the years the book to movie transition has steadily declined with this series and here the story is almost unrecognizable. I believed, I hoped, that splitting this book into two parts the powers that be would use the time to set right what they had failed in the other movies. To go back and explain key elements of the story and characters that they had glossed over before. But no, what they did was give us two hours of post-apocalyptic feely-type imagery and 3 teenagers roaming witlessly around the english countryside apparently without a clue between them - and very little magic either. JK Rowling wrote pages of clever dialogue in which these characters wrestle with their deepest fears and struggle with the smallest of clues that Dumbledore left them to unravel in order to defeat Voldemort. They planned and discussed and sacrificed. Harry went head to head with the minister of magic on moral principal. It took Harry months to convince Hermione to go to Godric's Hollow. But in the movie they do everything on a whim. It's all based on luck. Yates makes them look like idiots. This is the thing I find most offensive. And for a movie based on a magical world it seemed oddly lacking in magic. The Sorcerer's Apprentice had more magic in the first 5 minutes than the entire HP film. I will see the final installment because I need to finish this, but I am sorely disappointed. It's like watching a Cliff's notes version of a book you love. The heart and soul of the story is missing. The characters have been reduced to their lowest common denominators. If you haven't read any of the books do yourself a favor and don't start now. You will only know what you are missing. Wait until you have seen all the movies. Then read the actual story.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I was laughing so hard I almost forgot to breathe!!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	i wasn't sure it would, but it arrived in time to wrap and give as a christmas gift. whew.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"As the aggregation of six films, the first part of the final Harry Potter film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (whew), carries with it weighty expectations.  With each installment the stakes have been raised to the point where the final film will have awfully high hurdles to clear.  Besides, after making one's way through what's likely around fifteen hours of film already, you're likely going to want a massive payoff.  In the case of HP 7.5, it may be too early to decide whether the concluding movie delivers on the ever growing anticipation for the final conflict between good and evil, but I can confidently state that the film ingeniously ups the ante not by making Potter and his gang face off against even more powerful magicians, but by making our heroes grapple with their own interior fears, jealousies and existential nightmares.<br /><br />Just as the final film in the series has been cleaved in two, we might look at HP 7.5 as a film divided.  The first half takes the form of an espionage thriller, pitting Voldermort against the Order of the Phoenix.  Realizing that Harry might be the only person capable of defeating Voldemort, the Order of the Phoenix creates several Harry decoys in hopes of redirecting any assassination attempts away from the real Harry.  Their ruse is almost immediately discovered when several Death Eaters intercept the faux-Harries (and the real one) in mid-air, leading to an impressive chase scene across the London skyline and English countryside.  This action sequence is perhaps only bested by Harry, Ron and Hermione's infiltration of the Ministry of Magic, which has been recently co-opted by the Death Eaters, to retrieve a magic locket.  These set pieces give the audience exactly what they want from their blockbusters: big adventure and even bigger special effects.  Unlike the average blockbuster, which usually globs a bunch of CGI on the screen like a two year old with finger paints, HP 7.5's action is carefully crafted mixture of excruciating suspense and daring deeds.<br /><br />About halfway through the film, however, HP 7.5 makes a strange turn into what seems like a different film.  After recovering the magic locket from the Ministry of Magic, Harry and company flee to the English countryside in order to decide how to dispose of this mystical object.  The locket, we learned from the last installment, is a horcrux, or an object that houses part of Voldemort's soul and grants him eternal life, until they're all destroyed, that is.  The horcrux locket shares many of the same qualities as the ring in Tolkein's Lord of the Rings saga.  It cannot be destroyed by except under special circumstances and brings out the worst in whoever happens to bear the locket at any given time.  Naturally, the three take turns with the evil artifact, but this precaution still does not prevent the inanimate agitator from wreaking havoc on their interpersonal relationships.  Ron is the first affected by the heavy burden of the locket, accusing Harry and Hermione of carrying on an illicit affair and eventually abandoning their expedition.<br /><br />Of course, Ron isn't entirely wrong in his accusations.  It is difficult not to notice a simmering mutual attraction between Harry and Hermione.  After Ron leaves, the two of them share a dance to a Nick Cave song (a lesser director would have brought in the overused ""Hallelujah,"" and still an even lesser director would have used the Rufus Wainright cover), a surprisingly tender moment that is at first difficult to read.  By establishing that Ron's insecurities are more than just paranoia, the film utilizes the locket's magic to uncover real depth to its characters.  The majority of the second half follows the characters as they attempt to discover how to destroy the horcrux, all the while moving from one gorgeous British landscape to the next.  This extended camping trip seems somewhat lugubrious compared to the tightly constructed first half, and, as they stumble from one clue to the next Harry and Hermione seem at a loss as to what direction to take and where to go.  This is their ""Jesus in the Wilderness"" moment where the characters begin to question the efficacy of what they are doing.  We might also situate this stretch of the film within the innocence to experience themes that Rowlings has been working with since the first book.<br /><br />If we view the Harry Potter saga as a story about a boy growing up and learning more about himself and the world as he progresses through an educational system, then, like anyone who has graduated from high school or college, we must contend with the question of what this individual will do once he is freed from the helpful constraints of schooling, where the next step forward is always placed right in front of you.  Every schoolchild dreams of the freedom of adulthood, but few actually know what to do with themselves immediately after escaping the bonds of education (tellingly, Hogwarts is absent this time around).  Everyone has his or her moment in the wilderness.  This reading of HP 7.5 is bolstered by the strange, esoteric logic of the quest.  The way that Harry and Hermione stumble from one clue to the next signifies the sometimes directionless nature of adulthood.<br /><br />What's particularly ingenious about HP 7.5 is that it overlays adult existentialist questions over what is ostensibly a ""children's film.""  It is not, however, the first kid's film of 2010 to do this.  Toy Story 3 similarly grappled with questions of life's purpose and death's eventuality.  What makes these films ""dark"" has nothing to do with violence or obscenities (although the trash dump in Toy Story 3 was rather frightening), but rather with their ability to imbue films made for a broad audience with themes that most of us would rather not think about on our day out with the relatives.  There are other family films that are more violent and contain more sexual innuendoes, but these elements just as often make the films more juvenile as they make them more adult (filmmakers and fanboys take note).  HP 7.5 and TS 3 show us that big movies are capable of tackling big questions.<br /><br />HP 7.5 strides into theaters with the confidence only millions of ready made fans can muster.  It decides, with great effect, to slow the plot down just when most films would be hustling to throw everything they have at the audience.  It also includes a gorgeous animated sequence that incorporates fairy tales into the repertoire of Rowling's collage of influences.  If there is one thing that holds the film back, it is its role as prelude to the big finale.  It is difficult for a film without an ending to fully satisfy, especially when we know that part two is just a few months away.  Of course, when the credits roll on the final Harry Potter film, I reserve the right to adjust my score accordingly."
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"Why do all of his movies have to have moronic clues and symbols?  And why does M. Night Shyamalan's name have to appear above all of his films? As if he's a brand name to all of the other ""nameless"", ""talented"" directors that don't have to shove it in your face?  I think the advertising gimmick for all of his films has been: ""see the mysterious black box in front of you?, do you see the ornate mastery of the intricatley placed colourful gems painstakeny crafted onto the box? would you like to know what's inside of this century old box?""  Sure.  Well, guess what?  There is nothing ever inside of his box!!!!!!  You hope and pray, but again just another bait and switch.  Half way through the film I casually say to my boyfriend, ""this movie really bites the big one, huh?""  No reply.  I listen carefully to the sound of ""Zzzzzzzzzzz, snore........""  I couldn't even get a second opinion because this film put my boyfriend to sleep.  Oh and, if these people in this ""villiage"" are exiled and living off the land so to speak, why is it that all of their homes look like they were built by Home Depot contractors, and the interiors done by Ethan Allen.  Absurd garbage.  I even tried to lend this film to my neighbor and she stopped me in mid sentence and exclaimed ""oh noooo, I've already seen it, no way, just take it back"".  The silver lining to this travesty was I was able to get a free rental from a kind video store clerk who also saw ""The Villiage"" and felt sorry for me. Avoid this film at all costs, it's a scam."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is Jeff Dunham at his best. If you don't end up crying with laughter there is something seriously wrong with you
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"What can I say?  This DVD is fantastic and I have watched it at least 100 times since purchasing it--I have also dubbed the audio portion onto CD so that I might be able to listen to it in the car and at work!!  I have loved watching Jeff Dunham perform for a long time.  I recently got to see him in person and was thrilled with his performance!!  I would like to be able to see him perform at Kuss Auditorium in Springfield, Ohio if at all possible.  One of his newest characters, Sweet Daddy D, is the epitome of my Black brothers!! If anyone who sees this DVD doesn't find themselves laughing their heads off, then you must not have a sense of humor. Also, hearing Jeff do Sweet Daddy D is the first time that I knew what the word ""PIMP"" really means!! He is good at what he does and I hope he continues to do it for many years to come. Kudos to you, Jeff, for a job well done."
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	Those are Shawn T's own words.  Seriously bananas!  I am on day 5 of the program and am getting my tushie kicked but will definitely keep going.  All the other reviewers are right, it's not for the faint of heart or injury prone but it can be done, no matter what level you think you're at.  I pay attention when Shawn says form over speed so I will either modify the exercise or take a break.  I hope to update this review once I've finished the 60-day program but so far I am really motivated to keep going.<br />UPDATE 4/8/11: I am coming to the end of the 1st week in the 2nd month and I'm still going.  I can definitely tell that things are shaping up.  My abs are much harder (never had that before) and my core and back are stronger.  I haven't really lost any weight and my clothes are not falling off but things are shifting around.  My rear is more toned and lifted (didn't expect that so that's a bonus!) Towards the end of the 1st month, I was keeping up pretty well with the moves and taking far fewer breaks so I thought I was golden.  Then this month started and I was quickly shocked back to reality.  I am recovering from some new areas of soreness so I know that different muscle groups are working.  Even though there is no weight lifting, many of the exercises use your own body weight, so I'm improving the definition in my arms and shoulders.  The program is totally portable and I take the dvds with me when I travel and do them in my hotel room.  I'll update again when I finish this month.  If you're on the fence, just go for it!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Great workout if you want to get your cardio in shape. If you do it religiously you can't help but loose weight. I am a runner and wanted a new challenge, well  this is a challenge! I start dripping sweat in the first 10 min. I have not worked up to the longer workouts yet, but I will. I would diffintely recommend them if you are up for a challenge!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff is absolutely hilarious!  I gave this as gifts for Father's Day.  Everyone said they loved it.
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	Amazon delivered right on time as usual.  Jeff Dunham as popularized on You Tube is ROTF funny. Already watched several times with friends since purchase.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Absolutely hysterical!! I bought this present for my daughter before she went away to school and it was a lot of fun to watch!  I would reccomend this video to anyone who wants a good laugh.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This DVD is hysterical! A must buy!  remember it is for mature audiences only. Jeff Dunham is very talented, we love him!
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	I thought the movie moved to slow and there was a very weak storyline.  Effects where good but i need more than that.
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	I went to see this movie in the movie theater with my girlfriend. (I had no interest in the movie, but you know how that goes.) I've never before wasted my money on such a terrible movie. The acting was terrible, and the transition of the movie was even worse. My girlfriend agreed with me, worst movie we've ever seen at the theater. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Tom Hanks was great in this movie.  I'm a big animation fan. He made this movie very realistic.  I especially loved this movie in 3-D.  Worth the money.  Don't forget the 3-D glasses.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham has got to be one of the funniest and greatest ventriloquist's in the world.  His characters, though cliche, are down right funny.  At times while watching him, you'll start to think the puppet is real.  This DVD shows off Jeff's talents superbly.  Clocking in at around 90 minutes of nonstop hilarity with his puppets Walter, Sweet Daddy D, Bubba J, and of course everyone's favorite Peanut & Jose Jalapeno On A Stick.  The dvd includes outtakes which are just as funny as the show, 2 versions of the show (one censored and one not), and even for the first time on a comedy show: an audio commentary from Jeff and friend.  If you're looking for a way to spend 90 minutes laughing yourself to death, pick up this dvd.  Jeff Dunham is hillarious and after 5 minutes of watching it, you'll agree.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Great movie!  Now that we've seen it, we are definitely adding it to our collection! Great action and the cast is amazing!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is such a great workout. It's fun, challenging, and gives your body great results. I greatly recommend to anyone.
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	The Item got to my home fast, within a few days. The only issue I had was that some of the extra DVD's were scratched up and would not play. The Item was cheap pricewise so I did not bother with returning it. The important DVD's worked just fine. So over all I am pleased with my service.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Fireproof is an awesome movie about commitment in marriage.  I highly recommend every married couple or someone contemplating marriage to watch this movie.  It is well done.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I can';t say how happy I was when I found out they had cast Robert Downey Jr. for this role.  He was the best choice I think they could have made to play Tony Stark, and the movie benefits greatly from his presence.  I am a big fan of the comic series and was also happy to find that this was one of the better ones made, so far.
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	While I am a fan of the series, I was unable to understand the dialogue.  The audio portion was muffled and the British accent made most of what was said unintelligble.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	A young boy named Billy (Hayden McFarland) who wants to believe in Santa Claus gets his wish as a magical train and the conductor (Tom Hanks) gives him a ticket to hop aboard the magic train to the North Pole with other children especially the fast talking nerd boy named Know-it-all (Voiced by Eddie Deezen) as they head on an all till midnight journey to see Santa Claus before he leaves to give them their gifts.<br /><br />A magicial, imaginative and well done CGI animated fantasy that is very faithful to the popular kids book by Chris Van Allan. This is one of the first attempts at photorealism in CGI animation before Avatar perfected it, it feels a little plastic and crooked at times but who cares. Tom Hanks plays all 5 different characters and even has a voice by Steven Tyler in two roles, Robert Zemeckis has made an enjoyable and wonderful Christmas treat for everyone.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers stunning quality picture and flawless sound like if you saw it in theaters and of course there's great extras like trailer, featurettes, and motion capture segments.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"When I first watched this movie, I had no clue what was going on and thought it was just a ""scary"" movie, or was supposed to be something in the ""SIGNS"" era.  The second time I watched it in my history class, and had to take notes on it, and EVERYTHING makes sense, and it's a pretty clever movie.  ""Why did you watch it in history class?"" you may ask.  It is because we've been learning about utopian communities, and ""The Village"" takes place in a utopian community.<br /><br />  You can't let anything get passed you in this movie, because, like signs, what you hear and see early in the movie comes back towards the end.  And someone said that Adrian Brody's character Noah Percy (who is autistic) does something that makes no sense and has no explanation.  Ahh but it does.  I don't want to give it away, but if it's what he did to Lucious, then it is because Ivy told him never to strike anyone, so he didn't strike Lucious, instead he did what he did.  And if you're talkin about what he does to Ivy in the woods, then think back towards the begining of the film when he played ""tag"" with her.  See?<br /><br />  After seeing this movie again, I really like it.  M.Night does it again."
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	If I had never read any of the Sookie Stackhouse novels I would have given these DVD's 5 stars, but as luck would have it, I have read the Sookie Stackhouse novels and am a fan... of the original story. While I appreciate some of what they did in the TV series as necessary for adaptation, some of it was just over the top. I will admit I am interested to see where they go from here though, but will probably try not to relate the TV series to the books while watching.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	If you wish to be lied to regarding how the process of science works, buy this movie. If you think the contents of science class ought to be voted upon by the knowledgeable and cretinously stupid alike, buy this movie. If you're completely clueless about the fundamentalist-protestant origins of the so-called intelligent design movement and wish to remain so, this is your movie.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	We bought this movie for our son who was turning 3 and it is definitely his favorite movie! He doesn't sit still for much, so it says a lot that he wants to watch this over and over. We are very pleased with it, and have enjoyed watching it ourselves!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Very pleased with my dvd.It was a great price and came on time.I really enjoyed finally getting to to see the whole season.I missed a couple shows and could not wait to catch up.I would definatley suggest watching True Blood to anyone who enjoys vampires.Can't wait to watch season 2.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I had read and heard great things about this movie.  I purchased two copies of it.  I gave one to my sister since I knew she was going through a very difficult time in her marriage as all marriages do at times.  She and her husband watched the movie, and it prompted a lenthy discussion afterwards of what they could do to improve their marriage.  They both thought it was wonderful!  They are thinking of other couples they can loan it, too, that are going through hard times.  I have also loaned out my second copy of it to 3 other people, and they have all said it was excellent.  I am really looking forward to watching it with my family as well.  Amazon shipped it very quickly and the product and quality was excellent.  I cannot say enough good about Amazon.  They are top-notch!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Everyone should see this. I had no idea how our food is processed and distributed. It was truly an eye opening experience. I've made some major changes in my household how and what we eat as a result of this movie.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	For a science-fiction film it was very well made. Nice high-tec gadgetry and very good picture especially in HD. Good storyline although i thought it could have had a better storyline. Compared to other science-fiction films, this is one of the best in that category i've ever seen. Just wondering if this film had something to do with Aliens. Not quite clear on that.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"Just as Iron Man is the king of Marvel's second-tier comic heroes, Jon Favreu's ""Iron Man"" rules over the second-tier Marvel film adaptations.  Though not on par with the finest Marvel adaptations, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" series and Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" films, ""Iron Man"" rules over all others with an iron fist.  It all rests on the shoulders of Robert Downey Jr., who portrays titular hero Tony Stark with all the reckless ego which so many now associate with Americans.  Stark is a true American hero: he wasn't born with any superpowers, and though he was born into a substantially-wealthy family, it is he who pushes his corporation to its limits and who ultimately goes beyond those limits to become one of the shiniest superheroes.  He's further separated from his peers by the fact that he doesn't live his life in painful rememberance, and thus it's not pain that motivates him to do good.  What does motivate him, probably not even he knows.<br /><br />Like its protagonist, ""Iron Man"" is not one of the deepest superhero films to hit the screen.  Unlike ""Batman Begins"" (the sequel to which, July's ""The Dark Knight,"" stands as ""Iron Man""'s fiercest competition), ""Iron Man"" does not delve deep into the psychosis of its hero, opting instead to focus on his struggles as an up-and-coming superhero.  Stark's origins are explored in a gritty fashion not unlike ""Batman Begins.""  The similarities between Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne further connect the two films, but Favreau's vivid, colorful style ensures that the similarities end there.  Favreau was an interesting choice to direct, given that his past filmography is highlighted by two family films, ""Elf"" and ""Zathura,"" but he doesn't disappoint.  Stark's non-iron-clad activities mimic the character's lavish lifestyle, while the action sequences may be the sturdiest in any Marvel film.<br /><br />But far more sturdy is Robert Downey Jr.  Like Favreau, Downey was an unlikely choice for the film, but Downey elevates the film to a level it could never have reached led by another actor.  In fact, this is the best thing Downey has ever done.  His dedication to the role and love of the character shines through every one of Stark's smarmy remarks, apparent in every arrogant move he makes.  Downey turns a character who could easily lose the audience's sympathy into a guy one can't help but love.  It's hard not to get excited about Downey's cameo in ""The Incredible Hulk,"" Marvel's next movie, released in mid-June.<br /><br />Though Downey could easily hold the film on his own, he's supported by a delightful cast.  Most delightful is Gwyneth Paltrow, who is as adorable and charming in the role of Stark's gentle secretary Pepper Potts as anyone.  One wishes a character so irresistible and clever as Potts would play a bigger role in the film, but no doubt that'll happen in the sequel.  Similarly likeable is Terrence Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, military pilot Jim Rhodes - and who, as any fan of the comic knows, will wind up as Stark's iron-clad sidekick, War Machine.<br /><br />The most surprising performance comes from Jeff Bridges.  Bridges, perhaps best known as ""The Dude"" from the Coen brothers' ""The Big Lebowski,"" isn't usually the bad guy.  But that's just what he is in this film, and what a villain he is!  As Stark's partner-turned-archenemy Obadiah Stone, Bridges exhudes a ruthlessness and complete lack of morality not seen in any other cinematic supervillain.  His performance is what Kevin Spacey should have aspired to when he portrayed Lex Luthor in ""Superman Returns.""  It's a welcome change from the over-the-top behavior most supervillains are so fond of.<br /><br />Superhero films tend to be fond of heavy effects; after all, most of the films require them.  But the effect of the effects tends to be lessened by underdeveloped or overused computer-generated imagery (case in point: the last superhero picture, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"").  Not in ""Iron Man.""  There's the inevitable amount of C.G.I. effects, but the effects have been precisely designed.  They may even surpass the stunning effects from last summer's ""Transformers.""<br /><br />All this would mean little if the movie was not based upon a decent script.  This script is a fine one indeed, the product of two writing duos (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway).  It never takes itself too seriously, but just seriously enough, choosing well-timed witticism over self-conscious grandeur (as in ""Daredevil"" or the last ""X-Men"" movie).  It also, miraculously, is able to appeal equally to those familiar and those unfamiliar with the comics.  Part of this is the sensible decision to upgrade Tony Stark from a Vietnam-era weapons designer to a military designer for the Iraq War.  But while it appeals to fans and non-fans, it's those familiar with the comic that will enjoy the film the most: it hints at a number of potential storylines for sequels, and even sets up an Avengers movie.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is one of the increasingly rare films which longs for a sequel and which we wish would receive one.  Now that the film has grossed a stunning amount of money at the box office, a release date for ""Iron Man 2"" has been set for April 30, 2010, and a second sequel is ready as soon as that one's finished.  Bring it on.  ""Iron Man"" may not be an excellent film like ""Spider-Man 2,"" ""Batman Begins,"" or even the original ""Superman,"" but it's a darn good superhero film.  And if not as sturdy as steel, it is certainly as shiny as iron."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"This disk is going to provide you with all the laughter you is ever going to need, and together with Jeff Dunham's ""Spark of Insanity"" this disk could become a potential killer.<br /><br />The amount of stomachake and jaw-pains i had after this film is indescribable. The humour he provides is right on the spot, every single time."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Adorable! Enjoyable for car lovers of any age. Action, adventure and romance, set in beautiful and imaginative scenery. The animation is incredible. The plot is simple, but entertaining.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	This movie is every bit as good as the other three.<br />I felt like a little kid again watching good old Indy back in action... and this movie is filled with just that... action, adventure, humor, some very tense moments, and the famous implausible situations our hero always manages to escape from... just like the other three movies.<br />And that's what makes the Indy movies FUN.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	If you value your health, if you care about anyone around you including your family, watch this film. Buy it here or stream it on netflix but get it. ITS SHOCKING how twisted our food industry has become.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"Finally, after nearly two decades, we have the one film that I've been waiting for since my childhood, yet simultaneously had prayed would never be created...and early into this spectacle, it becomes clear that it is little more than one of the most pathetically obvious attempts to cash in on a dead franchise (uh...""Last Crusade"" was released twenty years ago, guys) I've ever witnessed. Not one shred of intelligent writing, solid acting, ingenuity, or quality went into the production of this monstrosity, and quite simply, I refuse to further acknowledge its existence. In my mind, it simply never happened. Here's why:<br /><br />First and foremost, this film simply pretends, for no justifiable reason other than the obvious fact that there was money to be had with another sequel and, of course, because Harrison Ford is virtually on his deathbed, that Indiana and his father never drank from the grail, which, of course, provides eternal life, as was clearly explained in ""...Last Crusade."" I suppose that Darabont (Lucas, rather) decided that the typical patron of the series would simply accept that this, for whatever reason, wasn't actually the case. Sorry; no deal. Believe it or not, this series, once upon a time, attracted an intelligent audience, and George, you can rest assured that any further ""Jones"" film will be attended only by ardent patrons of the WWF and ""The Mummy."" Fortunately, you should still be able to make a profit, as there are plenty of those to be found.<br /><br />Secondly, the film has turned Indiana, in an outrageously and inexcusably ludicrous sequence (Google ""Nuking the Fridge"" for further reference) into nothing short of a superhero, capable of surviving the thousand-MPH winds of a nuclear blast in a (lead-walled, of course ;) ) refrigerator. Huh. As far as I can remember, Indiana Jones was a human being, not a Marvel Comics title. Good work, guys.<br /><br />Thirdly, we have CGI. And more CGI. Still more CGI...and yup, you guessed it; it all looks terrible and cheapens the franchise in precisely the same fashion in which Lucas destroyed the ""Star Wars"" series (with those disgraceful cash-cow ""prequels""...). George; since you clearly directed this ""effort"" (I refuse to believe that Spielberg, despite his recent failed productions (""War of the Worlds,"" ""AI,"" etc.), had anything to do with this picture, much less direction), take a cue from reviewers, and realize that your awful CGI does nothing to promote either good film (per anyone's definition of the word ""good"" in this context) nor THX, who we all know means/does nothing, in reality. Please...for God's and all of our sakes, stop directing motion pictures. Now. Find a hobby...I myself enjoy collecting coins. Just do something that will occupy enough of your time that you simply won't have enough left to destroy any more of America's memories (we all know that Spielberg was the genius behind ""Jones"" in the first place...his magic, not your corny writing, was the reason for these films' massive success). Please. Go away.<br /><br />Now, without fail, there are numerous fanboys who will cry out that this pretentiously elephantine disease was intended to be a ""B-movie,"" and that, on this level, it succeeded wildly. Well...was the intention self-parody and unintentional hilarity? Was the intention to scrape away the dignity and integrity of the franchise? Or, per my contention, was it simply an effort (which, according to Lucas, has failed) to extend the series to Shia LaDouche for the further purpose of producing moneymaking garbage with spinoff sequels? Give me a break.<br /><br />One of the worst major motion pictures ever created, ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" has nearly cost me my faith in Hollywood; if this fiasco is now the best that Hollywood's best director (Spielberg) can assemble, what hope should we have for the future of the industry? Please, for God's sake; if you have even a trace of the love for the three *actual* ""Indiana Jones"" masterpieces that I do, do not, for one second, lay your eyes on this hideous ogre of celluloid (I think it's actually some ""digital film"" that's been used here...and it looks false and awful, all around)...<br /><br />Oh yeah...I forgot to mention the aliens. Ok, that's quite enough of that topic (utterly speechless). This film simply CANNOT be considered to be a serious addendum to the Jones legacy; it is a parody of the series, and nothing more. Actually, on that note, I suppose I can recommend the picture, if you're either simply *looking* for a hilarious parody of the series, and to watch Ford bumble around looking like a complete fool, or for a reason to stop watching movies altogether and to start getting some exercise. ;)"
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	I felt that the film needs a re-edit. The flow was broken and the logic is not continuous. Could be a lot better. The director seems to be enamored of special effects
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	I was nervous going into this retelling of Snow White given the spilt reviews. After seeing it for myself I can say it's a worthy retelling of the legendary tale. Kristen Stewart, in my opinion, was a great Snow White. I feel like Kristen will be forever tainted as a terrible actress by viewers because of her role in the Twilight Saga which made her play a character with no emotional depth which is very unfortunate. Charlize Theron was an even better Evil Queen. But like many other people have noted, her performance is a little over dramatic at times and I couldn't help but giggle (yes, giggle) at her extremeness. Chris Hemsworth did great in his role as the Huntsman and I didn't see any resemblance to Thor in his performance. The film barely dragged in the middle.<br />On a side note, Mirror Mirror sucked donkey balls.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	A remake(Alien .... Alien resurrection) , and as stupid as the original. Unless you like that kind of movies, don't waste your money and time.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"Prometheus and the space ship are symbolic of Western civilization; the movie is a political allegory about how the global network of parasitical, usurious, NWO Central Banksters and their poisonous fiat money scams have drained the lifeblood out of Europe and the US.<br /><br />Prometheus, who endured terrible suffering to give the gift of fire (creativity) to the Greeks (Western civilization), nevertheless decides to kill his progeny -- the humans who carry his DNA. Why? He concludes that neither he nor his progeny -- represented by the crew -- are capable of defending themselves against the ruthless, bloodsucking aliens. Rather than let his descendants become hosts for the destructive parasites, who cannot survive on their own without attaching themselves to a captive host population, Prometheus, as father, decides (as did the Romans) to exercise his right and responsibility to kill the members of his household -- earthlings.<br /><br />Elizabeth Shaw, however, shows herself to be worthy of -- and even more inventive than -- her self-sacrificing progenitor, Prometheus. She tears the abominable alien parasite from her womb; she instructs her noble crew to save the earth by ramming their spaceship into Prometheus' ship to keep it from destroying earth; and she asserts her faith in Christendom by demanding that David give her the cross; she vows to go in search of her Maker despite the difficulties. The Germanische android, David, who served his grasping slavemaster Weyland, who showed himself willing to sacrifice the safety of the earth as well as the ship and its crew to prolong his own fading life, switches his allegiance from Weyland to Elizabeth. In David's words, Elizabeth has shown ""a remarkable sense of self-preservation."" David does all he can to help Elizabeth -- his unemotional, pristine intelligence is curious to know whether she can complete her quest.<br /><br />The question remains: Will the United States eliminate the financial parasites and show the same sense of self-preservation as Elizabeth and the same sense of patriotic duty as her crew.<br /><br />Just as God entrusted a woman, Mary, to give birth to Jesus, God has entrusted another woman, Elizabeth, to tear the Satanic parasite (the antithesis of Jesus) from her womb. Mary was victorious in her mission of giving birth to the light -- and Ridley Scott implies that Elizabeth will also be victorious in her mission to re-kindle the protective light of Christianity that has been deliberately and systematically dimmed in Western societies. Will the Hollywood Cabal subject Ridley Scott to the same defamation campaigns and ""honey pots"" that they inflicted on Mel Gibson in revenge for his movie, The Passion of Christ?"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This has become our 3 1/2 year olds favorite movie. He laughs, plays with his Lightening car as he's watching, talks to the characters during the movie, or joins in with the dialog as the movie is playing. He can watch it over and over and over again. Sometimes all in the same day.<br /><br />Thankfully my husband and I like this one too. It's wonderful to see the characterization of Richard Petty, his wife and Dale Jr. along with other drivers. Not to mention the laughs that pop-up during the credits.<br /><br />And don't miss the special added cartoon at the end. The Ghostlight will make you laugh as well.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Loved the books and movies.  Wish they had bundled part 1 and 2 together earlier.<br />My kids have watched the movies multiple times and still enjoy it!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I am an athletic female who gains muscle easily and was trying to avoid the ""bulky"" look that I achieved so easily in sports and working with a personal trainer.  I tried Crossfit but was immediately turned off by the overly muscular and judgmental women who said stuff like ""she's skinny fat"" and ""don't you want to look like us?""  No. No I do not want to have man shoulders and a body that I define as ""bulky"" (even if you think bulky = body builder, which it does not!).<br /><br />If you're in a similar situation to me, then you will LOVE insanity.  I was skeptical at first after hating P-90X (not enough cardio, too much shoulder work).  Several friends suggested Insanity for me because I 1. Love cardio but hate running, 2. Work crazy hours and so needed something I could do from home, and 3. Like to have something challenging with fast results.<br /><br />I absolutely love Insanity.  It's like it was made for me.  I love Shaun T (great motivator) and from a vanity perspective I liked that the women in the videos still looked like women. I completed all 60 days of Insanity and now I basically alternate between the ""max"" and ""regular"" videos each morning and take 1-2 days off/week.  I started the videos at 25% body fat and am now at 18% body fat which was my goal.  I lost 7 pounds and my clothes fit more loosely.  I tried to post a before and after link but Amazon deleted it. If you want to see my before and after pic go to pinterest dot com slash sandcastle2 and check out my ""fitness"" board.<br /><br />Here is some practical advice for women (and men) about using the videos and things to watch out for:<br /><br />General:  If you are out of shape, obese, or generally hate to exercise, don't do these videos.  I'm not sure why this isn't clear to people.  But this is challenging. It's still challenging for me and it always will be because you determine how many reps you do and how quickly you go.  If you are completely out of shape you will likely get discouraged in the first two weeks, so be prepared.<br /><br />I do Insanity in my basement on workout mats on top of carpet.  I tried it once on hardwood floor and will never do that again (it's high impact).  Our basement stays a cool 62 degrees year-round (live in NorCal).  I tried this in my parent's house in Texas in 80 degrees and I nearly gave myself heat stroke.  I strongly recommend doing this in front of a fan if you don't have AC or naturally cool weather. Keep water nearby at all times and a towel (you WILL sweat).  Give yourself at least an hour of cool down time after the workout.<br /><br />I find that none of the stretches Shaun T. leads you through involve enough back stretching.  I have a bad back, mostly upper and some lower, so I tend to pause the stretch and do an extra 2 minutes of back stretching.<br /><br />As a woman I have been unable to complete all of the ""real"" push ups (push up jacks, v-push ups, moving push ups in particular).  Instead, I do most of these with my knees down and occasionally do regular push ups.  I have built incredible strength and muscle tone this way, so it's OK to do ""girly"" push ups.<br /><br />Diet:  I am a vegan (don't hate) and so I did not follow the nutrition guide.  I eat a lot of beans for protein and some soy.  I find on days that I did not have enough sugar (fruit) I was unable to complete these work outs.  Everyone is different, just be safe and listen to your bodies.  I had a buddy who tried to do these videos on paleo and could never finish.  Find a balance with your sugar because you do need it for energy.  I drank Kaeng Raeng shakes instead of Shakeology after my work outs because I preferred the taste and the high fiber content.<br /><br />Video-specific advice:<br /><br />Plyometric:  This is essentially the ""first"" video of the series after the fit test.  In the second interval, there's ""basketball drills"" where you squat down and ""jump from the bottom.""  Do NOT bend over as you will hurt your back, but instead squat down fully (it's harder but correct).<br />In that same interval are ""ski abs"" and ""in and out"" abs.  If you are not strong enough in the arms, you will find ""in and out"" abs nearly impossible.  I alternate between in and out abs and doing crunches instead.<br /><br />Cardio Power: In the second interval you will do ""globe jumps"" where you squat down and move side to side and back.  This is another exercise where it's tempting to cheat.  If you bend over to touch the floor instead of squat down your lower back will hurt for a week.  In that same interval there's moving push ups.  I was never able to do these so instead I either do moving plank or regular push ups.<br /><br />Cardio Recovery (First):  After doing this video I was basically unable to do any Insanity for 3-4 days.  I tried it a few times, but every time it would kill my quads so bad I couldn't go up and down stairs.  That's not really my style so I skipped this video and did yoga instead.  I'm sure it's great for building strength but I found it too debilitating to incorporate regularly.<br /><br />Pure Cardio:  This video involves about 15 minutes of non-stop exercise (no breaks) but Shaun T encourages you to take a break when you need it.  The first several times you do this video you likely won't make it all the way through. Don't worry - you're not alone!  It took me a full month before I could do all 15 minutes without stopping.  At the end of the video there are push up jacks which I struggle with.  I, instead, do normal push ups or push ups with my knees down.<br /><br />Cardio Core and Balance: This is the ""off week"" video.  I did it once and found it too slow and boring so I just went right into the max videos.<br /><br />Cardio Abs: Frankly this is the weakest part about Insanity.  I substitute P-90X's ab-ripper X instead.<br /><br />Max Interval Circuit:  In most of the max interval warm ups, the last exercise is ""side to side hops"" where you have your arms down and hop your legs from side to side.  I have found, for some reason, that this is way too high impact for my quads.  Perhaps I am not strong enough in the arms, but I do floor runs instead.<br /><br />Similarly, in the max interval warm ups are ""side to side jump rope.""  Don't watch the people in the video because it will totally throw off your rhythm and make those impossible.<br /><br />In the second interval you do ""floor switch kicks.""  These are intended for ab work but if your arms aren't strong enough you likely won't get the ab benefit.  I alternate between regular kicks and the jumping switch kicks to give my arms a rest.<br /><br />Max Interval Plyo: The beginning of this video is quite a lot of leg work, so I was only able to do about  of the ""squat push ups"" at a time.  It's so tempting to do these exercises incorrectly to make it easier on yourself but you'll regret it later.  In the second interval you do power push ups where you jump in and out of push ups.  For some reason I never got good at those and so I do regular push ups.<br /><br />In the last interval you do these side push ups where you put your hands at a 90 degree angle and kick your legs out to the side. The first time I tried this I hurt my wrist, so I've resorted to doing regular push ups instead for similar results.  The same thing goes for the side burpees - I just do regular burpees instead.<br /><br />Max Cardio Conditioning:  This is definitely less high intensity interval and more ""can you work out for 45 minutes straight without a break?""  I really enjoy this workout on days when I don't want to do the high intensity stuff.<br /><br />Max Sports Training: This is one of the better videos for your ""off"" days.  Still will get you into a sweat, but not the cardio from the other videos.  There is no stretch at the beginning of this (not sure why) so I like to pause it after the ""warm up"" and do my own stretching before continuing on.<br /><br />All in all I have had an incredibly positive experience with Insanity.  I put the videos on my iPad and take it with me when I travel.  I'll do Insanity in hotel gyms and people always come up to me and ask what I'm doing.  I've basically memorized the videos at this point, but it's nice to have Shaun T motivating you.  I tend to wear dry fit Lululemon clothing and Reebok flex (light weight) shoes.  My biggest complaint about the program is how often I have to do laundry because of how sweaty my workout clothes get!  A great problem to have &#61514;"
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	Thanks AMAZON for the delivery.The product is in excellent condition and it got on time.I also have the dvd.However this edtion on blu-ray looks much better.That's why I started to rebuy all the HP movies on Blu-ray.I know that some fans think that this movie is rather short compared with the book.But you know it's difficult to put too much info on  2 1/2 hours.Anyway the movie works incredibly well for the sequence of the story.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	I am very disappointed in WB for not putting out the extended editions.<br /><br />To put the record straight, THERE IS AN EXTENDED CUT OF GOBLET OF FIRE!!!  Every time I watch ABC's Harry Potter weekend they add about 3-4 (or so, never counted) minutes of footage (i.e. Snape in the grounds during the Yule Ball talking with Karkarov and busting a couple in a car, Durmstrang students asking Hogwarts girls to the Yule Ball and bowing, etc)<br /><br />So why is ABC family allowed to show this version if the director said he didn't want to do a director's cut?  He obviously already made one and these versions will be released in a year or two once the Potter Series wraps up and WB feels the need to milk a few extra bucks from the franchise.<br /><br />Nothing in Prison of Azkaban, and I am all good with that, but to not release an extended cut of Goblet or Order when we know the footage is out there is insulting.<br /><br />It's like the Special Extended Editions of Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars on dvd when George Lucas said he would never release the original versions on dvd, i bought the special editions, then two years later had to double-dip to buy the regular editions.<br /><br />Why are the studios so intent on robbing us all blindly?  I own over 200 blu-rays, the format is really only 4-5 years old, and they're already doing re-releases on some of the title I bought a few years ago.  I feel ripped off, and I'm getting sick of it.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Oh my word, if you have never seen Jeff Dunham, you will want to.  Jeff Dunham is the funniest ventriloquist I have ever seen.  He has the craziest puppets (my personal favorites are ""Peanut"" & ""Walter"").  The world is way too serious and this is a great way to just sit back and laugh until you hurt.  Totally fabulous."
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	This movie could have been done much better by Chris Columbus.  (The director of the first two movies).  The meaning and feelings in the book are stripped out of the movie and those who do not read the book are missing out on the magic of the series.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"This movie is by no means the best Indiana Jones movie out there, but it is certainly worthy of being in the franchise.  This movie has a very similar feel to the original trilogy, but it has some differences, too.  Lucas and Spielberg have mentioned that the original movies were made in the style of the old 1930's serials.  They decided to film this one a little more like the 1950's sci-fi ""B"" movies.  This works very well in the new movie, which uses the much of the same witty dialogue and over-the-top action sequences that make the Indiana Jones series so unforgettable.  I definitely recommend this movie to any Indy fan."
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	Thankfully Harrison Ford's age had nothing to do with it. He's just fine. In 19 years we've all become more jaded & a lot harder to impress with obvious but great special effects. Even so I recommend seeing this on the big screen because those special effects are that good. However, seeking out crystal skulls that may or may not have existed are not as compelling as the Ark of the Covenant & the Holy Grail. As we have changed so has Indy. He is no longer a treasure hunter plundering other countries antiquities, for $$$ & his favorite museum's glory. He is seeking to return a crystal skull, gain knowledge & prevent the greedy commies from getting it. Bringing back his old girlfriend, Marion, was a really nice touch. In a minor plot she also had a son that is Indy's. He becomes Indy's sidekick & you could see that coming a mile off. Cate Blanchett is somewhat miscast vamping it up as a Garboesque villian. That had to be done deliberately. A great summer movie & it should win the season unless the ladies rally around the ultimate chick flick, Sex & the City.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Truly recommend this movie for people that believe in Marriage.<br />Beautiful touching movie that truly emphasizes the importance<br />in both sides working out the Marriage together. There is always<br />hope as the movie portrays. With Christ, anything is possible.<br />If both truly fight for the Marriage, Christ will strengthen them.<br />The beautiful comparison of a firemen to his wife is beautiful too.<br />Great plot and great story overall. Excellent movie!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"From the opening sequence, I knew that this would be the best movie of the series.  And it is.  By far.<br /><br />From the outstandingly ballsy cinematography to the acting (it's like night and day between this movie and ""Goblet of Fire"", which was great in it's own right but can't touch this), from the witty and quirky script to the special effects, it's clear that director David Yates single handedly whipped the Harry Potter movie franchise into shape.  While movies 1-4 were great, they were like unpolished stones; at points they tried so hard to go along with the books and at others tried so hard to separate themselves from the books (think ""Prisoner of Azkaban""'s shrunken heads), but this movie--""Order of the Phoenix""--knows what it is.  It is a film, and it makes sense as a film.  Everything you need to know to understand the film is here, and--unlike ""Goblet of Fire""--you won't need a previous understanding of the books or even the other movies.  Certainly fans will complain about deviance from the book, but these are the same unreasonable people that wish the movies would be twenty-four hours long so they could squeeze in every line of dialogue.  ""Order of the Phoenix"" is how a book should be adapted.<br /><br />Every actor, from Daniel Radcliffe to Emma Watson to the kid who plays Dudley, is at the tippy top of their game.  They're playing young adults and they act it; they laugh, and they cry.  This is the first time that I actually totally suspended my disbelief while watching a Potter film, and that was almost all due to the superb acting.<br /><br />I did expect a bit more from the climax (the important character death was kind of wiggy) but things get roaring back into shape for a perfect duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort.  Following that, everything touched on in the movie wraps up beautifully.  No threads are left untied, and no plot left with an open end.  Very, very satisfying.  Oh, and if that isn't enough, this should be:  Evanna Lynch is spine-tinglingly good as Luna Lovegood.<br /><br />It may not be what you expected, it may not be what you thought you wanted...  But for me, it was more on both counts.<br /><br />10/10 Classic."

B00447G29S	3.0	b	"I'm beginning to learn not to trust in previews to give me an accurate sample of what a movie might have to offer, because I've had several movies fail to deliver on preview-induced expectations. I don't think my expectations were terribly high; a warm fuzzy Christmas movie that would be on DVD within a few months, and would become part of the essential holiday viewing, alongside Frosty and Rudolph. Unfortunately, the movie didn't come through. I felt like I'd been on two or three roller coasters, and had been left out of much of the Christmas magic.<br /><br />PLOT: As you might have heard, two of the three main kids are never named. There is the primary boy (sometimes called Hero Boy,  but I'd call him Doubting Thomas) and the young girl he meets on the train (hereinafter referred to as the Believing Girl) and the somewhat disillusioned boy for whom ""Christmas just hasn't worked out."" All three are invited onboard the Polar Express by The Conductor (Tom Hanks) for a round-trip visit to the North Pole to have their Christmas beliefs confirmed. (Except, the Believing Girl never seems to have lost her faith, so I wonder why she was on board)<br /><br />GOOD: There is a good deal of Christmas warmth and fuzzy -- but it's kind of scattered. Any movie whose landscape is dominated by lovely, fluffy white snow is somehow attractive, and there's plenty of it to be found. There is a strong message of belief and trust in unseen things, or as the Conductor puts it, ""sometimes the most real things in the world are the things you can't see."" The music is a definite plus, with the sweeping choir lending splendor to the North Pole. (And for Josh Groban fans, his ""Believe"" song is featured in the end credits)<br /><br />BAD/OBJECTIONABLE: I can't necessarily say there is anything BAD per se about this movie, but in several ways, it failed to live up to expectations. There seemed to be a lot of needless foreboding in the film. Hero boy/Doubting Thomas encounters several different dangers, perils and oddments while traveling to the North Pole, including meeting a phantasmal hobo stowaway on the train's roof who is kind of creepy, which happens while he is trying to catch up with a girl who he's been told is going to be thrown off the train, being grabbed by what appears to be the same ghostly apparition for an adrenaline-pumping race on skis down the train as it plummets down a dip in the tracks, very nearly falling off the train, thinking he's about to crash into a mountainside, and being scared by creepy, retired toys in one train car when the wraithlike hobo takes up the strings of one marionette and begins scaring him. As well, he is also frightened when the train skids across a giant lake of ice which has encroached on the tracks. The train is nearly submerged before grasping the tracks. He becomes stuck on board a runaway train car, falls and starts sliding down an enormous chute, and precariously inches his way across a train trestle, perched over miles of empty space. He and his companions then wander through eerily vacant and abandoned areas of the North Pole while trying to rejoin their group. Even the elves (who behave more like they're at a political rally than sending Big Red on his way -- you'd think they get enough of the Big Guy during the year) seem sinister or creepy.<br /><br />All of this might potentially frighten youngsters, but also detracts from the magical Christmas spirit that one would expect, leaving you feeling more like you have to catch your breath than snuggle tight those you love. The entire first twenty minutes or so of danger and intrigue while traveling to the North Pole seem absolutely pointless, not to mention wandering. There is some thematic material regarding belief/ non-belief in Santa which some choosy parents may wish to avoid. I think the emphasizing of belief is a good thing, but not when the whole ""belief"" part is contingent to children being taken to the North Pole before their beliefs can be confirmed.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: There were mixed reviews when this film first came out, and now I understand why. I have mixed feelings about the film myself. At times, you're checking your watch and curious why you're sitting there. Then once some of the Christmas magic (perhaps at its strongest with Matthew Hall and Meagan Moore's ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" song) begins to set in, you're hooked. But then moments come along which snap you out of it, and then you're pulled right back in again; a very up-and-down cycle. Hero boy/Thomas seems left out of a lot of the feeling of magic at the North Pole until the very end, and since we're primarily from his perspective, we're left out as well. I would almost rather have seen it from Believing Girl's point of view, to capture more of the belief and spirit of Christmas.<br /><br />As far as the animation goes, excellent job all the way around, with only a few moments where the character seemed stoic or unrealistic.<br /><br />I think any movie should have you talking about it afterwards, but I'm afraid all my siblings and I could do was discuss the upcoming Narnia film.<br /><br />Conclusion: Mixed feelings, but if you think you want to see it after what you've read, then you'd probably want to."
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	This DVD is excellent, as are all of the Harry Potter Movies. The Only complaint I have<br />for this and Part Two of this feature is that it is not available in full screen as are<br />all of the other seven movies to this series. For everyone who has purchased the first<br />seven DVD's in full screen, it ruins the collection when the last ones are not available<br />in the same format. A lot of people will end up feeling ripped off, who don't like the<br />movies in wide screen presentation. I for one am tired of movie collections starting out<br />giving you a choice, and then ending with only one format available. The spiderman series<br />did the same thing. The first two were available in both formats, but the third was only<br />available in widescreen. Then to make matters worse, everytime this happens, it's always<br />the widescreen with the largest black bars, instead of the small ones, making the picture<br />even smaller. Even on a big screen TV it's like watching a movie through two slats in a<br />fence. You'd think if they were only going to offer one aspect ratio, that they would<br />compromise and use the format with the smallest black bars and largest picture. You'd<br />also think that if they're going to start a series of movies with a continuing story,<br />that all of the movies would be released in the same format. I Love the Harry Potter<br />movies from beginning to end, but I'm certainly not going to re purchase the entire<br />set just to get them in the same format, no matter how cheap the price. Once I've purchased<br />a show, I think that should be that. So to the manufacturers of these DVD's which have<br />numerous sequels, please finish what you start. I feel ripped off everytime you do this.<br />As for the movie, it was great. These stories were great from beginning to end. Great job<br />on bringing these stories to film. I highly reccommend all of the Harry Potter movies, but<br />only wish all eight were available in fullscreen.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"This is definitely one of those ""love it or hate"" it type of films. I belong to the former by the way :) Anyway, I think it was an ambitious sort of film that was not without serious flaws. I found the score (especially lead violinist, Hilary Hahn) and sound effects a perfect complement to the overall tone (no pun intended) of the film. In fact, I felt that the dominant violin gave momentum and a strong emotional identity to certain moments within the film.<br /><br />  Important Side Note: Before I proceed any further I have to make something very clear - I've spent an inordinate amount of time reading other reviews of this film so much so in fact that I'm not sure if I'll be able to compose a completely original one myself without borrowing from someone else's thoughts. With that said, I will try to the best of my ability to remain as original as possible. If anyone sees anything similar to what they had written from here on in ... my humblest apologies! It was sincerely unintentional. Also, be forewarned - spoilers ahead so if you didn't see the film yet, you may want to wait before you read any of this.<br /><br />  Moving on, I found that most of the ""a- list"" performers were basically too restrained and woefully underused throughout most of the film. I understand that these characters were supposed to be pragmatic people living in simpler times and not given to excessive verbosity but, it would've been nice have seen a couple of more dramatic speeches like the one given by William Hurt in which he was attempting to justify his unilateral decision to allow his daughter to go to the ""towns"". Although Sigourney Weaver had some dialogue, it seemed very inadequate and fine veteran actors such as Celia Weston did little more than offer up occasional facial gestures and body language throughout most of her scenes and that was a shame to see. I think this ended up being a bit of a miscalculation on Night's part. Maybe the film would've been better served by casting all the principals with unfamiliar actors. Sometimes it's good to ""anchor"" a film with a few familiar veteran actors but, in this case, I think it was more of a distraction from the human tapestry/community theme that was being presented at the outset of the story. When the focus ultimately shifted away from the village and on to Ivy's undertaking, I really felt a lot of that good talent went to waste. Maybe the distraction was part of Night's plan to surprise the audience with the sudden realitization that the true story of the village was really about the blind girl, Ivy rising up out of relative obscurity to become the main protagonist of the film. Night himself states, in the bonus section of the DVD, that the emergence of Ivy as heroine was the big ""secret"" in the story (as opposed to the ""O. Henry style twist"" at the end). I think it was intentional of Night to cast a ""not famous yet"" actress to play the part of Ivy in order to divert the audience's attention away from the big secret that was yet to unfold. She sort of blended in with the background of the story until the time was right for her to emerge and become the focal point. By the way, Howard's portrayal of Ivy is one of those special few performances that will haunt me and linger with me for a long time to come and if this is any indication, Bryce Dallas Howard will be a household name in no time. It was a wonderful and important breakthrough performance for this fine young actress.<br /><br />  The film is full of allegory...political, social you name it. The story of Little Red Riding Hood has always been looked upon as a microcosm of the epic struggle between good and evil and the second half of this film (shall I say) borrows heavily from that fabled story. An innocent kind-hearted blind girl driven by a selfless sense of love and compassion for another human being... I know it's easy to be cynical and dismissive about this and see the film as being blatantly manipulative but, I made the leap of faith and allowed myself to be caught up with her struggle as well as the somewhat-misguided good-natured intentions of the village elders. We all know it's wrong to try to maintain a society through fear and intimidation but that seems all secondary to the notion of trying to make a better world for the ones that we love most and that's what Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), Ivy and the town elders were all attempting to at least try to do. And, we as the audience, already know the inherent futility in all of this and get a front row seat to witness the beginning of the end to this would-be Utopian experiment. How ironic that the elders attempted to create and control a manufactured community through fear, ignorance and intimidation ... the very same reasons they abandoned their own modern society. They should've know better and therein lies the tragedy in this gothic horror/romance. Their misguided attempt to preserve innocence was perhaps all in vain because what ultimately makes societies ""go bad"" comes from deep within the human condition and all attempts to isolate people from perceived ""bad"" external societal factors is the ultimate exercise in ignorance and futility. The ill-fated love triangle turned violent is a good case in point. William Golding's novel, ""Lord of the Flies"" addresses some of the very same issues.<br /><br />  I also noticed a lot of symbolism throughout the film. I tend to overanalyze things more than I should but this is some of what I picked up on (don't laugh!):<br /><br />  Ivy's passage through Covington Woods could be interpreted as a personal journey as opposed as a trip to ""the towns"" in order to retrieve medicine for the ailing Lucius. This purgatorial ""rite of passage"" (complete with sinkhole and sinister red monster) could symbolize Ivy's own personal pitfalls and inner fears. By defeating the creature, she conquered her own fears. By tricking him into killing himself is an act of self-consummation which, kharma-wise, serves as a fitting end for such a wretched creature not unlike the proverbial serpent swallowing its own tail. If you noticed, her final obstacle out of the woods was the ivy-covered wall. So, in a way, Ivy's final obstacle was herself - further bolstering the position that she was conquering herself and things within herself.<br /><br />  The sinkhole could also represent the dark abyss that lurks within each and every one of us. Maybe poor Noah ended up falling into his own abyss - lying at the bottom of his own emotional pit of despair (and yes, I know an abyss is supposed to be bottomless).<br /><br />  The creature could also be an external manifestation of Noah's (Adrien Brody) own anger, frustration and inability to express himself as others could. His own personal ""id monster"" perhaps.<br /><br />  The red and yellow colors could be a swipe at our own national terror alert color coding - the inference being that color could be used to control and moderate the flow of the collective anxiety of a population of people (e.g. red = bad and yellow = not so bad). Combine that with the fact that the self-appointed leader's name is Walker - maybe an esoteric reference to George Herbert Walker Bush.<br /><br />  The forest can be associated with fears of the unknown...fear of becoming lost amid a faceless, nameless uncaring society, and on and on and on.<br /><br />  Like the fall of countless totalitarian societies throughout history and, on a much smaller scale, modern-day Amish and Shaker style communities... they're all doomed to eventual failure but not for lack of trying, mind you. Instead, the failure arises from man's attempts at suppressing the human spirit and his endless attempts at assuming the role of creator... never going to work. Personally, I kind of hope that the village survives (which is what the film suggests) but, I think it's only a matter of time before bigger and greater crises present themselves further weakening the framework of this particular society to the point of implosion. Then again, maybe I shouldn't be so pessimistic and maybe I should have more faith in the positive side of human nature and maybe that's a message that the film is trying to deliver as well.<br /><br />  But what serves as an inspirational counterpoint to all of this is Ivy's success at overcoming every possible obstacle that life had placed before her to complete her mission driven only by her love and concern for Lucius and probably every other single member of that community. That's the heart of the film for me... boundless triumph of the human spirit. When society fails the individual, the individual somehow finds a way of redeeming society. That's the emotional core for me at least. That's what I'm taking away from all of this and that's why I go to the movies.<br /><br />  Final thoughts: Excellent cinematography with wonderful use of light, shadows and fog. Remember how the homes were backlit in the evening? Great sound editing and awesome soundtrack. I loved all the taut, tense moments but the romance was what this story was all about.<br /><br />  Best scene moment: When Lucius Hunt pulls Ivy into the house at the last possible second right before the creature was upon her. Everything was perfect - the violin, the camera angles, the looks on their faces... At that instant, I realized how destined they were for each other and how selfless their love was for each other. A perfect moment in film-making."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I wanted to own a Blu-Ray DVD to be able to show the capability of my new LCD and Blu-Ray player and this Iron Man DVD serves that purpose well, so I'm happy with that.  I had seen the movie before so I knew what to expect.  What really pleased me was that the supplier, which was capcityoutlet.com, filled the order right away with no delay, it was packed very well and arrived in perfect playing condition, which was my main concern.  Based on this order I can highly recommend capcityoutlet and would order from them again.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	From the promo campaign I really wanted to see this movie. I finally saw it on DVD and boy was I disappointed. The story of the film is shockingly weak and the suspense of the film is quickly replaced with a really stupid story of a blind girl wandering in the woods charged with saving her love. This is a film that could have been great with more work on the script. M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directs this film and it seems to me he needed someone to tell him the script was more like a half hour episode of the twilight zone that a full length film. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid. Save your money and see something more worthwhile.
B001OHS8BQ	3.0	b	well my biggest problem with the movie was my grandpa is a fireman and buys fire moves hint the name fireproof. it wasnt even about that like ladder 49 or backdraft. but overall the movie was good
B0006989TE	4.0	b	I randomly picked up this movie off the shelf from BlockBuster and really had no expectation. I thought it was a weird movie for the first 30 mins. And then the plot thickened and got more and more interesting. This is the sort of movie that you watch with a slight confusion during the first half of the movie and got worried that it would turn out crappy. Luckily for this one the filmmakers did know what they were doing and I had to smile at the end because it all clicked. The movie has a lot of great points -- strong actors, great storyline, brilliant plot twists, and quite beautiful scenes.  I really like it but I'm not giving it a five because, despite all good points, it didn't leave me with a lasting impression and I didn't rush out to buy a DVD.<br /><br />In short, this is definitely a good movie, one that you won't be disappointed. I wouldn't mind watching it again on HBOs but it's not something I'd pay $25 for so I could watch it over and over again.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	OK, the queen was not bad, the forest was interesting.  That being said, the angst was so thick you could cut it with a knife.  The end was so poorly done and so flat faced that it reduced my review a star for just those few minutes.  The story was so predictable that it actually put me to sleep (in the theater, not even comfortable chairs).  I have to say, unless you are a twilight fan, flee from this movie, it is a one watch movie at best.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	...this movie did not work in my bluray...My bluray player is Panasonic DMP-BDT110.<br />i don't why but i din't watch this movie as 3D.  Meanwhile I have more 5 3D movie and all of works wonderful...<br /><br />the seller accept to return and i ship back...
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Great fun family movie.  Love RDJ and the entire cast is awesome!  The Iron Man saga is truly an adventure in cinema that is worth the price of a ticket.  We will continue to support these epic movies.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I laughed so hard I cried.... and I mean that literally. I was in tears from laughing so hard. You know how they talk about laughing until your sides hurt? That was me. I had to make myself stop laughing from time to time because I wanted to hear the next joke!<br /><br />This guy is freaking crazy and I mean that in a good way! I have watched a LOT of comedians and there are very few that can be this funny without being dirty.<br /><br />Jeff Dunham has reinvented the Ventriliquist artform... he has taken it to a new level. And this is more than a spark of insanity. It's a spark of pure comedic GENIUS!
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	I have seen the movie at the theater during opening day and this review is solely based on the film, not the DVD package.<br /><br />The movie had great acting and stunning visuals but the writing and storytelling is absolute crap.  Like with Star Wars, stick with the first 2 films, Alien and Aliens. There are so many stupid elements in the story of Prometheus that in my opinion, it's not even worth owning on DVD, unless you're a special effects guru/fan of sci-fi films.  The sets and the ship are amazing, but as I've said, what ruins the film is the story; without revealing any spoilers you see dumb scientists doing dumb things, a huge disappointment of a film.
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	This season is really good - it establishes a cool story in a very interesting setting. It's got a loosely underlying plot theme that eventually plays out with a somewhat shocking twist. However, there are some boring episodes that prevent this season from being truly great. It does a good job setting up the vastly superior second season, though. The video quality is fantastic for a standard dvd and there are some decent extras. If you are on the fence about starting to watch this series, then pick this season up when it is cheap. You will enjoy it and it will allow you to follow the plot and know the characters as you start the second season. Viewer beware, however, as this show is not for the faint of heart. Violence, nudity, profanity - it really pushes the limit as far as what previous television has shown in these departments.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Heard about this movie from my friends and people i know. This movie is the best story and picture i have seen from scorsecesedcee. A must own, especially if you like great acting. All the actors in the movie seem like they were free to really play their characters how they wanted to play them and develop this story. The ending is a trip. Get it fool!
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has everything that would make a great action adventure film, as far as its visuals are concerned. Inspired by the fairy tale everyone knows, the film has great photography, great production designs and great costumes, plus stunning effects. What it does not have is an engaging story, a heroine you relate to, and a director who knows how to tell a story.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart plays the titular heroine, who escapes from Charlize Theron's evil queen into the dark forest, where she encounters the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth). What follows is their adventures and romance. The film's adventure part is just average with several decent action set-pieces. The film is also supposed to be a love story, but there is no passion throughout the story.<br /><br />For all the best efforts from the leads, the main characters Snow White and the Huntsman remain uninteresting in this dull and boring in this revisionist take of the fairy tale, which does not know what it really wants to do. Over-the-top Charlize Theron plays Ravenna, whose motive (and method) of taking over the kingdom never convinces. Actually, none of the film's characters are really credible, except supporting characters of digitally rendered dwarfs played by veterans Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones and Ray Winstone.<br /><br />Modern-day retelling of fairy tales is nothing new. Perhaps you remember ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror,"" (1997) a ""realistic"" take on the famous story. The new version may have better visuals and designs, but sadly the filmmakers have forgotten to polish up the story."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	If ur into collecting Disney Diecast Cars. Then, this item is for worth buying. Just imagine, ur purchasing the DVD Blueray CARS movie w/c includes a Gold Mcqueen (rare) & a Ransburg Mater. Is that a COMBO or What?! If ur going to buy the gold mcqueen in ebay...that's too expensive. Buy it in Amazon. You have a Combo pack.<br /><br />Im pretty much excited on the upcoming Disney CARS 2 next year (June 2011). I wonder what would be the Combo pack for the DVD Blueray Disney CARS 2....hhhhmmmm<br /><br />Thanks Amazon...Ur heaven sent!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is a great show!! Jeff Dunhan really pulls out all the stops. Next time he come to town I'm going to see him. You want to have great laugh watch this video. Hard to beleive, it's better that first one.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	"""No Country For Old Men"" is an interesting movie, and worth seeing depending on you taste in films. That said, I'm not convinced it's the best film I've seen this year. Anyone seen ""Once?""<br /><br />I'm not certain as to what criteria the Academy was using when it voted this film ""Best Picture of the Year,"" but it does leave one wondering if the voters actually saw any of the other films nominated in that category. I, for one, just didn't feel the film contained all the key elements needed to warrant the statue. And for those who loved the ending, I say, what ending?<br /><br />If this film warranted any Oscar consideration, it was for ""Best Actor."" I mean, just what does our favorite Harvard man, Tommy Lee Jones, have to do to win an Oscar these days. His performance in this film was, as always, outstanding, as was Javier Bardem's.<br /><br />To me, this was simply a new way to make a movie about gore for gore's sake. And I think the Coen Brothers were a little out of their element on this one. For those of you who loved this move, I say great. For those of you who didn't, I can understand why."
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7F5SS"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a> is another great installment in the Harry Potter series (and, in my opinion, much better than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PMV9FG"">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition)</a>). It features the internal dissension in the wizard world between those fear Lord Voldemort versus the bureaucrats who fear losing power. Imelda Staunton as the Ministry of Magic bureaucrat Prof. Umbridge plays her part well. Often funny, always perky, she steals the movie. She has a great soundtrack theme as well. Nicholas Hooper's theme for Prof. Umbridge is a perfect mix of control-freak and 1950s female streotype.<br /><br />I took off one star because, as a movie, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7F5SS"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a> can't stand alone. It tells the story of the book well enough. However, at the end of the day, it seems too transitional, too much a gap-filler between the return of Voldemort and the final battle. It never really develops into a compelling enough story in its own right. If you're not a Harry Potter fan, this movie won't hook you onto the series. If you like the other Harry Potter movies, I think you'll like this one."
B0006989TE	2.0	b	I was not on the edge of my seat one bit throughout this whole movie. I had the plot figured out before I even got to the middle of it. It is not original. They did something similar to this on the Outer Limits. One of Shyamalan's worst.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	It was a great first season that gets you even more excited for the second season.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I just loved this DVD. I laughed till I cried. It's just great. I can't wait to share this jewel with others!!!
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"I was aware of the extremely diverse reaction to this movie....some people loved it, and many (including most professional critics) despised it....but I purposely avoided any prior knowledge of the plot twists or surprise ending, so that I could render an objective opinion.<br /><br />Predictably, it was a mixture of excellence and mediocrity: The splendid cast portrays characters that are generally devoid of any personality or enthusiasm...they deliver their lines (especially Wm. Hurt) in an extremely slow, halting cadence that becomes tiresome. Their conversation sounds like Amish people speaking under the influence of seconal, and if I lived there, I would spend all my time completing their sentences.<br /><br />Other than the children, there is virtually no joy in the village...largely due, no doubt, to the red-cloaked ""monsters"" that menace the villagers from the woods that surround them. I felt that the monsters and their menace were very well presented. I was totally ""creeped out"" when one of them visited the village late at night and almost got its claws (twigs ?) on the blind girl, Ivy, the ""star"" of the movie, very well played by Ron Howard's daughter.<br /><br />All of this tension and suspense began to unwind (for me), however, when Ivy is sent to ""The Towns"" (apparently external civilization) for medicine for her injured boyfriend. I swear that I recall this plot from an old Twilight Zone about 40 years ago. Perhaps that memory, or just common sense, led me to figure out the ""surprise"" ending well before it happened.<br /><br />The transparancy of this final plot twist is probably the movie's greatest flaw. See it for yourself...and you decide...there are definitely portions that are worth the time and effort, and I must say that is quite original in atmosphere and staging, if not plot."
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	Arrived in a timely fashion. Was packaged like new.  Won't know if the DVD is good until Christmas Day; it was a gift.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"One of the great pleasures of summer is the release of the big budget, popcorn films that feed the eye with amazing special effects and take the movie goer on an action-packed thrill ride!  Not all summer films achieve the goal of pleasing the masses but this new movie, based on the Marvel comic book hero, Iron Man, does just that!<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr., the talent and charismatic actor who received an Oscar nod for his turn in ""Chaplin"", takes on the role of Tony Stark, an extremely wealthy man whose fortune has been amassed by providing weapons to the world's warriors, good and bad.  After being abducted and held by terrorists in the Middle East, Stark realizes the damage his weapons are doing and decides to change the path of his business.  After escaping from his captors using an armor he creates during his abduction, Stark returns to the U. S. and begins working on an improved version that will allow him to fight the forces he has empowered with his own, technologically advanced weaponry.  Thus, the birth of Iron Man, a super hero with a flashy red and gold suit of armor that packs a treasure trove of crime fighting gadgets that would make even Batman jealous!<br /><br />  Aiding Stark is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his dedicated executive assistant and apparent future love interest and his best friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard).  Jeff Bridges plays Stark's mentor and father figure, Obadiah Stone, a man who took young Tony under his wing after the death of the elder Stark and groomed him to take over the Stark empire.  All three actors do a great job with their parts, especially Paltrow and Bridges.  Hopefully Howard's character will grow in the inevitable sequel.  And, of course, there is the usual Stan Lee cameo, which is quite funny in this film.<br /><br />  Jon Favereau did a great job with this movie and apparently pleased fans and non-fans alike, considering its impressive take thus far, both domestically and internationally.  Although I was a comic book kid growing up, I never read the Iron Man comic books but I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  I have to give kudos to Marvel for really making sure that their latest hero films are up to par---Spiderman (other than Spidey 3, which was a disaster), the X-Men films and now Iron Man have all been well made and appeal to everyone.<br /><br />  Grab a friend, buy some popcorn and sit back and relax with the first blockbuster of the summer!  Highly recommend!!"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	IRON MAN went way beyond my expectations. I was blown away. Robert Downey Jr. is incredible. He seems to get better with each film he makes. He makes Iron Man and true to life hero despite the implausibility of it all. He literally gives this character heart (no pun intended). IRON MAN is a thoroughly entertaining film thanks to a great script and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. I like the way the film makers updated the setting and integrated the origin of Iron Man into the current socio-political situation in the Middle East. I was totally surprised how good this film was. This is one you just have to see. It entertains but works on such an emotional level and  that's what really makes it work.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I don't know what I could say that hasn't been said already, but this film is positively genius! First rate animation, amazing characters, great voice acting, wonderful plot with morals and lessons to learn, great soundtrack, it's perfect. An all around great family movie that's one of our family favorites!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is a genius. His material is hilarious and appeals to a wide range of audience. We have watched it over and over and shared it with all of our friends and family.Hope there is more Jeff Dunham in the future.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	The image of the movie goes bad! It kept buffing an loading when it wasnt HD. I had no choice but to watch it!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"So good to drop in long after the 1st-timer reviews, on a really enjoyable film that I've only just seen. Not just that: today's crummy offerings (mostly involving silly brainless teens falling into comic books or video-/Hasbro-based schlock) suck beyond all recognition. That is why IRON MAN takes the prize in my book.<br /><br />As most of my generation and the following two, I grew up reading comics. Of all, Marvel Comics were my favorites. It is a thrill each time a Marvel character is done justice. In IRON MAN, nothing disappoints. In spite of today's grand cine-tech, this is a seamless, superbly executed work of art.<br /><br />Featuring the dramedy-slapstick talents of Robert Downey, a growling villain in the form of Jeff Bridges, we have as a perfect spice the support of Gwyneth Paltrow and Terence Howard. This film will show you what ""supporting role"" is supposed to mean.<br /><br />Though there are multinational (presumably Muslim) terrorists, who give Tony Stark his Iron Man initiative, this film is lighthearted, fun, never overbearing and funny as hell. Thanks to this, Downey got offered Sherlock Holmes, and IRON MAN really is his 'comeback'. He reins in Tony Stark's pathos and gives us a strong, determined man who is not afraid to grow. Jeff Bridges' villain shows the opposite side of that coin brilliantly.<br /><br />I loved hearing Paul Bettany's sexy voice as Stark's computer Jervis, and the inventions, gadgetry, even weapons were a fantastic treat. When I think of the hatchet job done by Christian Bale to BATMAN....<br /><br />Here, IRON MAN is overtly political but not in any patronizing, annoying way. Stan Lee has always been 'political' marching to his own drummer's beat, and this movie reflects that better than any other I've seen so far. Political can only take you so far: the rest had better be entertaining and just plain good. And IRON MAN IS GOOD!!<br /><br />Now that its sequel is floating around, get and enjoy this unique film. There are explosions, but everything looks and feels so new here. That is a level of skill I just don't see anymore. Samuel L. Jackson gives the perfect ""this-is-about-to-get-big"" cameo at the end, and I nearly jumped out of my seat at that promise--which I can only hope has been delivered as well as this delivered.<br /><br />IRON MAN will be a classic, mark my words."
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"In a movie theater, everyone can hear you scream. In frustration.<br /><br />Prometheus is one of those movies you hear about whose pedigree alone is enough to get your blood pumping. Directed by Ridley Scott, the creator and director of the first Alien film, and set up as a self-contained and whole-new story parallel to the other Alien films, it had a lot going for it out of the gate. That also means it had high expectations to deliver on  from fans and critics alike. After all, Aliens was the first action film to win an Academy Award (citation needed). Sigourney Weaver, who played Lieutenant Ripley in the other movies, almost set up an archetype on her own. And let's not forget, the Alien films have had an unquantifiable influence on video games.<br /><br />There is a lot to be said for Prometheus. It had a remarkable production value, and a strong cast of talented actors. It had an excellent cannon mythology to draw from, and, of course, the adoration of millions. It is a shame then that so much went wrong to produce one of the series' more unforgettable entries.<br />Warning: Spoilers below. Proceed at your own caution.<br /><br />Let me begin with the good. The movie is remarkably well-shot, but then, we expect that from a Ridley Scott film. The cinematography is full of gorgeous landscapes that expand beyond the typical helicopter pans. The few shots in space are exceptional as well, ands of course, the dripping, dank corridors under the ""pyramid"" are happily reminiscent of the true-blooded Alien films. It's important to keep in mind that almost all of the indoor sets are ""practical effects,"" which is an impressive feat of its own.<br /><br />Scott uses an excellent design aesthetic to establish a brightly-colored and suitably neon futurist look. Underground, he sticks to what works: cramped, shadowy and uncomfortably organic halls and corridors that bend just enough that they might hide a monster behind them.<br /><br />But that's the problem with this movie. It isn't a creature feature. Instead of following the tried and true formula of unassuming blue collar people making a horrendous discovery,  fighting, and dying horribly to stop the alien from spreading, Prometheus tries to tell a creation story. Therefore, since we know that there are aliens, and from the opening scene we know what they look like, it gets weird. Indeed, the crew of Prometheus, the (titular) ship, are going to find them after discovering an identical array of stars on several ancient cave paintings. This is the first of the film's many drops of logic, as we learn from the founder of the film's nefarious Weyland Corporation, Peter Weyland (played, for some reason I can't fathom, by a badly-made up Guy Pearce) that the trip isn't a mining expedition, it's an archeological/contact mission!<br /><br />This, naturally, upsets the crew of geologists and miners, who are in disbelief. So are the viewers, who already knew it wasn't a mining expedition. Why are we wasting time with a seemingly pointless lie? Why were the miners tricked into coming along? Who are these two ""biologists"" spreading nonsense about humanity being ""engineered""? In fact, one of the characters goes so far as to ask, ""How do you explain three hundred years of Dawinian Evolution?""<br /><br />The answer is, you don't, as the film forgets that question like a toddler amped on sugar. But it's OK, because the unbeliever gets his faceplate melted onto his head by a cobra-like variant for the xenomorph. Serves him right for asking questions, no? F**k the scientific method.<br /><br />The inability to answer--and in some cases even remember--the questions Prometheus raises is the lynch-pin problem of the movie. As a film, it has a collective memory of about two minutes. For example, in the second act, after the engineers are officially ""discovered,"" one of the lead ""scientists"" descends into a juvenile, brooding drunken depression, because he didn't find any of the ""engineers"" alive. BUT THEY'VE ONLY BEEN ON LV-223 FOR A DAY. A SINGLE EARTH DAY. Likewise, when one of the crew is resurrected as a zombie (or something?) and kills a bunch of the unnamed blue collar maintenance dudes, the captain calmly destroys it, no one ever mentions it again, and that's that.<br /><br />This ignorant bliss plagues the movie from start to finish. In fact, Prometheus is one of those unfortunate films that really suffers from the loose-thread (or chin-scratching question-raising) problem: when you tug at one stray end, the entire carpet unravels. For some films, tugging one stray thread leads to a long and interesting discussion about technique, metaphor , or narrative. Not so here. This is hugely unfortunate, because the movie is ambitious. Scott and company were clearly trying to do something new with the source material,but they stepped too far and fell right on their plate glass helmets.<br /><br />Which reminds me: for some reason, the explorers have space suits that break and smash with the slightest impact. This doesn't make any sense, given that we have better technology right now. In fact, we have since the 1950s. But that is the unfortunate bad science that you have to swallow from Prometheus. Bad tech and nonsense science are as common as are the many unanswered questions. One last nerve-grating example: using an electric wand to ""trick a two thousand year old corpse into thinking its alive,"" thereby failing to properly observe standard and common quarantine rules the world over, and put the entire entire crew at risk. It's also just stupid.<br /><br />I could rant for a long time about the quarrels and qualms I had with this film, but its just a waste of breath. Ultimately, despite the stupid inconsistencies and errors, I did enjoy it. Mostly. I've never been a huge fan of Ridley Scott's films as narrative vehicles anyway: its his cinematic sense that catches me. They are strangely and startlingly beautiful pieces, each in their own way, that establish unique aesthetic grooves for the future of their respective genres. Take for instance the importance of the slick, oily, and cramped vision of LA in Blade Runner, and compare that to the sci-fi movies that followed. Compare Alien to the dozens of knock-off ET creature features; Gladiator to the dozens of Roman-inspired films. And as a movie, Prometheus is a visual masterpiece, one which I really hope that future sci-fi directors take a strong cue from in the visual department. The contrasting colors, the stark and grim caverns, and the obsessive attention to detail are wonderful. Watch it for that experience alone, but do not expect a follow-up (or lead-up, anyway) to Alien that matches the 1979 masterpiece for tone, vibe, or intelligence.<br /><br />And don't expect to have many questions answered, either. Also, to paraphrase a friend, future space-explorer underwear is incredibly boring. Shaw haw nothing on Ripley."
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	The movie made me uncomfortable for the actors.  I was embarrassed for them.  Hemsworth and Stewart were just annoying and Charlize Theron forced an uncomfortable accent and uncomfortable dramatics.  Where was Sean Bean?  (Saw him in the credits - but didn't see him in the movie or what did I miss?)  I would not call it the worst movie I've ever seen - but it could have been so much.  Too much of a bad LOTR rip-off.
B001KEGR8Y	3.0	b	One of the Funniest Comedians around. You hear some of the material he's used on tour for years. The results are side splitting funny.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	"Disappointment is the word that best describes my feelings after watching this movie. Mr Shyamalan is a skilful director, but it seems he is doing the same thing over and over again. All his characters, in all his movies, are stupefied individuals that do not talk much and have surprised expressions on their faces for most of the time. I really liked The sixth sense, then everything that came after that is just, in a way, some sort of boring repetition of the same story. I think I will keep watching Mr Shyamalan's movies, but next time I will know what to expect. A great trailer, a promising start, and then disappointment crawling in slowly but steadily, and a real let down at the end. The whole ""unbreakable"" was one of the very worst and more pretentious movies I ever saw, Signs was promising, and at time really creepy, but it ended being the usual stupid trivial Hollywood movie about characters going through adversity and finding solutions to their inner problems (with some sequences really embarassing), this movie starts looking like a well done horror, and then after the first hour I started doing something else while the DVD kept going on. The sequence with the blind girl in the woods starts well, but then it turns quickly into a totally unbelievable story. I think it shows that Mr Shyamalan has no idea whatsoever about what it means to be blind.<br /><br />This is a good director that should find a way to stop doing the same thing over and over again. Very very disappointing. But if you keep your expectations low, you may want to rent this DVD. I would never buy it, though..."
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	This movie won the Oscar for best movie, which makes you wonder about the contenders that year. It's a well made movie in terms of production value, acting, and direction. But ultimately, it is nothing more than a stylized slasher flick including the obligatory weapon gimmickry. It pretends to be social commentary about the problems with drug trafficking. But it fails to be convincing because the characters are so incredulous, especially the villain. The plot is also ridiculously unbelievable. With $2 million of ill-gotten gain, wouldn't you be flying off somewhere?! Some aspects of the movie was difficult to follow due to the Texas accent. Having seen the movie, I really wasn't even sure who Chigurh was, or the character portrayed by Woody Harrelson, and where they came from. Or what the point of the role of the sheriff was. And what happened to the money!? Yes...it's true...there is no ending. I watched this because I liked what the Coen Brothers did in Fargo and O Brother where Art Thou. But this movie is one big notch below those two, and certainly is not best movie of the year material.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	My kid equally loves Toy Story and Cars. I went to Target to buy the 2 movies on. dvd so I could stop paying to order them off tv. But it was over 40$ for both so Amazon was my best option. I not only got Toy Story much cheaper, but it was a brand new 2 disc 10yr edition and I had enough left to order the Cars dvd brand new too! My son is a very happy boy and I'm happy I saved money...I will definitely order the rest the the movies here too (Toy Story 2, 3 Cars 2)
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is the hardest workout I have ever done. But, it is the one that provides results! I am on my fifth week and I look forward to completing the routine and seeing my end results. I highly recommend this program.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Actually...........he didn't turn to steel in a great magnetic field.<br />Nor did he travel time for the future of mankind.<br />Kind of like Spiderman I never really knew much about Iron Man.<br />So.............I tried to watch this with an open mind.<br />Ok, let's be brutally honest here. By the time I popped Iron Man into the DVD player I had just gotten home after being out with the co workers.<br />Iron Man got popped into the DVD player and I plopped down on the couch, not just tipsy, not just a little woozy. I mean, fall off the couch TANKED!!!<br />Vodka seems to affect how much I like movies.<br />And how did I like Iron Man in my drunken stupor?<br />I LOVED IT!!!!<br />I'm not a big fan of Downey Jr. but  I'll be darned if he didn't do an excellent job.<br />In the past I've been critical of overly long reviews and yet my most recent reviews should have been called novels instead.<br />So...............I'll keep it short.<br />What's good?<br />The acting, the script, the FX of course.<br />What's bad?<br />Not much really.<br />People may gripe about the negative Arab stereotyping and granted it is getting a tad old.<br />But that minor little complaint aside Iron Man was a blast to watch.<br />How many of you wanted to fly after watching this movie?<br />I sure did, but I could barely make it off the couch to the bathroom so flying probably wouldn't have been the best idea at that particular moment anyway.<br />Anyway.........Iron Man, loved it!!!<br />A great way to spend an evening and yet another movie I wish I had taken the time to see in the theater.<br />Vengeance from the grave, kills the people he once saved...............nobody wants him...............he just stares at the world.<br />Love the movie, love the song........who the hell were Sabbath singing about anyway???<br />Iron Man doesn't seem to do anything the song talks about?<br />Oh well.........<br />Iron Man?<br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Iron Man lives agaaaaaaain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	Just got home from watching the premiere of &quot;The<br /><br /> Village&quot;. AWESOME! I was completely blind-sided by<br /><br /> this one. I expected a horror/sci fi thriller like M.<br /><br /> Night Shyamalan's &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or &quot;Signs&quot;.<br /><br /> Instead, I found one of the most captivating love<br /><br /> stories I've ever viewed. Before I go any further, I<br /><br /> must say that if any of you are true<br /><br /> romantics...like thought-provoking love stories...then<br /><br /> you will undoubtedly place &quot;the porch scene&quot; in your<br /><br /> mental scrapbook of memorable love scenes. If this<br /><br /> one doesn't have Academy written all over it, nothing<br /><br /> does. This is by far the best directed, scripted and<br /><br /> edited film I've seen in a long, long time. Bryce<br /><br /> Dallas Howard as Ivy is one of the most convincing<br /><br /> performances on record. I went with my son and his<br /><br /> girlfriend. She walks out of the theatre saying, &quot;Am<br /><br /> I a total girl or what? I cried through the whole<br /><br /> movie.&quot; I walked up to her and said, &quot;don't feel bad,<br /><br /> I did, too&quot;. Bryce deserves to be in the running for<br /><br /> Best Actress come March. And, Adrien Brody's<br /><br /> portrayal of Noah should garner a Supporting Actor<br /><br /> nod. Add to that Joaquin Phoenix (starred in<br /><br /> &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Signs&quot;) as Lucius, Sigourney Weaver<br /><br /> as Alice Hunt, and William Hurt as Edward Walker.<br /><br /> Shyamalan's casting is superb. The script is near<br /><br /> perfect. It's a film where words play a much greater<br /><br /> role than sound effects and costumes. As you know, I<br /><br /> never give away a plot. I definitely can't with this<br /><br /> one. The twists are intertwined at moments when you<br /><br /> think you just figured out the stunning ending. I'll<br /><br /> be one of the first in line to buy the DVD...even if<br /><br /> it's just for &quot;the porch scene&quot;. And...I would be<br /><br /> remiss if I didn't add that this flick may also get a<br /><br /> Best Film nomination. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being<br /><br /> the highest), &quot;The Village&quot; gets an 11 in what has to<br /><br /> be a new genre'. I would call this a romantic<br /><br /> thriller/adventure. Nothing like it! GO SEE IT! And<br /><br /> please, take someone with you to hold hands (my dog<br /><br /> Stan was busy) and a pocketful of tissue. It was<br /><br /> fabulous! PAUL
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I've been a fan of the Harry Potter books for many years and have found most of the films a bit disappointing, although entertaining. But with Deathly Hallows, Part 1, the film team has finally lived up to my expectations. The script stays much closer to the book than most of the previous installments, with a lot of the best dialogue from the book included word-for-word. The trio of young actors turn out their best performances yet, with Rupert Grint giving an outstanding performance as Ron. I loved every minute of this film.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Product arrived on time and as described. Will definitely do business with this company again. Thank you.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	I found this movie to be a wonderful delight.  Tom Hanks did a wonderful job in the several different characters he played in this animation story of a child who has stopped believing in Santa Claus.  Besides the wonderful animation, which is a must see, the story begins with a young boy who has stopped believing in Santa Claus, and in an attempt to restore the boys belief in Santa Claus, A Train arrives at the boys house, (The Polar Express), and takes the boy on a magical train ride where the fun and magic begins.<br />Eventually after a long journey through the wilderness, and across many glaciers the train arrives at the North Pole only to find out that not even one minute has passed, which also makes the film a little more magical and mysterious.<br />But I think what really pulled this film together for me, and made it a wonderful delight to see, was how Santa sought out the one boy who had lost all belief in him, and gave him a present (a sleigh bell) which could only be heard by those who believe in Santa, and restored the hope and belief of a young boy.<br />I rate this film four stars, because of the wonderful animation, and the storyline.  A must see Family Film, which is safe for children of all ages.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	What does Sin City share with the Fight Club? Girls won't get it and they'll hate it!<br /><br />Besides, who talks like this? These characters say things guys wouldn't say to themselves let alone out loud. Okay, never mind the cartoon dialog ---- this is a cool ride.<br /><br />The movie is broken up into 3 segments and wrapped in the introduction amounting to 5 minutes in the beginning. The movie starts with one character and ends with him.<br /><br />So, sit back, have a couple of bruskies and a shot of whiskey and strap in. It's going to be a bumpy ride.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please add your vote.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	These are great tapes. also the prices are great.. bought for my husband and also for gifts..
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I just finished my 60th and final day of insanity today, and i'm still here to tell the tale! As everyone else says, these workouts are nuts...I've never sweat so much in my life. By the end of each workout, you're completely spent.  I was in decent shape to start but my muscles got smoked after the first few days.  Let me tell you, this progam works if you stick with it.  If you take it seriously, don't pause the workouts and bust your chops each day, you'll see major results!  I didn't follow any of the suggested diets, but I ate lean throughout the 60 days and I think that helped as well.  I'd recommend protein shakes, fruits, veges and lots of lean meats (chicken, fish).<br /><br />After completing these workouts, I've noticed my cardio has gone through the roof.  The biggest reason you improve in your fit test numbers is because you can go harder for longer periods.  My flexibility has improved ten-fold after these workouts.  Advice: take the stretches seriously, they really help with flexibility and help prevent pulling a muscle.  My only regret is, like others say, it doesn't do much for bulking you up.  My abs and core got quite toned, and my legs and back are stronger than they've ever been, but it doesn't look or feel like my arms changed.  Therefore I'd suggest adding a few curls and pull ups whenever you can.  Also, the exercises do get a bit old after two months, but you don't have much time to think about it since you are so exhausted.  All in all, though, these are minor complaints given how pleased I was with the overall program.<br /><br />The program is definitely expensive at ~$130, and it's sad to think you have to pay about $15 per workout. In the end, though, well worth it when you consider the results.  I like how efficient this program is.  Only 40-60 mins per workout, which is much better than P90X.  And only 60 days.<br /><br />In the near future, I plan to resume running with ~2 insanity workouts per week.  I plan on doing the whole program again sometime, but it won't be anytime soon!  My friends are all hooked and can't wait to borrow my discs.  Overall I'd strongly recommend Insanity...if you are up for the challenge!  Good luck!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I wish every American would take the short amount of time it takes to watch this.  It is full of such interesting and valuable information.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This is one of the better comic book movies.  Acting, dialogue, storyline, pacing, special effects are all above-average.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"Finally, a violent Art Film that the critics can enjoy too, without feeling guilty about it. And they can spew some pseudo-intellectual nonsense about how transcendent it is symbolically. It's not. It's really intellectual hypocrisy. (My reasons are at the bottom of this review.)<br /><br />A friend and I were discussing the blank negativity that seems to be permeating The Hollywood Landscape of filmmaking these days. Children having children, children killing children, killing and murder, murder musicals, and torture porn. (Richard Roeper's term for the latest trend in horror films.) This film came up in the conversation. My friend called it ""dysfunction of the human spirit."" I wish I had said that.<br /><br />My friend is fairly brilliant because that's what this film is really all about... And, the fact that you can use a cattle punch to kill people and open locked doors. This is a film that proselytizes against it's very own dysfunction. It's cynical and depressing filmmaking with a self-abnegating moral. I know a lot of the blame for this lies with the author. I know someone who read it. Apparently, it was just as dysfunctional as the film.<br /><br />NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a violent exploitation film that is posing as a deep moral artistic statement about society. It's not. It's really a violent lowbrow crime drama about a killer chasing a guy that stole some drug money. On the peripheral, a lawman and some other interested parties, including a bounty hunter played by Woody Harrelson (what a waste of a great cameo), are also giving chase and making pretentious speeches.<br /><br />The film has some good noir elements. Like blood leaking out of cowboy footwear, a wounded dog limping across the plains, and lots of dead and bloody bodies lying around. Booyay!<br /><br />The cinematography and direction are topnotch. It has a great look. My guess is that it was not shot on film, but digitally. (You may correct me if I'm wrong.) Which allows the cinematographer to shoot at night using only the ambient light of the location. Lighting a shot is the most time consuming aspect of filmmmaking.<br /><br />The beginning of the film is quite stunning, and I thought I was in for a real treat as far as the storytelling goes. But, the unbelievable plot degenerates into a dull chase with lots of homicidal killings. (See my review on Michael Mann's COLLATERAL.) The story is fairly pedestrian and mostly dumb. It's full of holes. Not just bullet holes, but plot holes. (SPOILER ALERT) Bardem strangles a sheriff and murders an innocent motorist with a cattle punch and no one alerts the FBI? There is no massive manhunt or statewide dragnet? R-i-g-h-t. I just knew the satchel of money contained a transponder. I even yelled, ""transponder,"" outloud in the theater before it was said or revealed later in the film. No one was in the theater to tell me to ""shut up."" Ho-hum.<br /><br />It has a cast of mostly underdeveloped characters. Javier Bardem plays a cartoonish sociopath and is not particularly menacing in his Prince Valiant haircut. He makes a face when he kills like he's just eaten the best ice cream ever. Pretty hammy. And Tommy Lee Jones plays the same old lawman that he always plays in movies. The killer gives two of his potential victims the choice of life or death, with the toss of a coin. A sociopath with a conscience. Then, he nonchalantly walks around town in the open with a cattle punch and a silenced shotgun, pleasantly shooting and almost killing everyone in sight. Mostly at night. But, also in broad daylight. I guess there are no people in Texas. Or no people in Texas with phones. Realism is not at fault in this film. I guess it takes place in Bizarro World. Or Bizarro Texas. Apparently, the killer got that cool coin at The Bizarro Franklin Mint in Bizarro Pennsylvania. ""Truth is stranger than fiction?"" Yeah, whatever.<br /><br />Towards the end of the film, how is the protagonist, played by Josh Brolin, found? Does it matter? What happens to Brolin's wife? Oh right, it's ambiguous. Resolution is antithetical to a Serial Killer Art Film.<br /><br />A couple of good oneliners make this feel like you might be watching a Coen Brothers film, but it's protagonists are not as comically inept as the ones in BLOOD SIMPLE or FARGO. There are some offbeat cameo characters that appear to be refugees from a David Lynch film. But, they feel like an afterthought. I chuckled a few times, but mostly, I yawned through this boring exercise of Art House Noir. I couldn't wait for this film to be over and I kept looking at my watch.<br /><br />My Uncle was a Commander in The L.A.P.D. for more than thirty years. Cops don't suddenly have an epiphany about evil and crime after a lifetime of law enforcement. They develop a hard outer shell very early because they deal with the scum of the earth on a daily basis. I  didn't recognize the lawman in this film at all.<br /><br />The message of this film seems to be saying ""that the times they are a changin'."" There was a time when a lawman could get the job done without a gun and some fancy detective work. Now the law is outmatched, which spells doom for all of us. The abhorrent underworld is now a part of the American landscape. And it's populated with sociopaths that kill and maim without remorse.  But this film revels in the killer's flair for creative mayhem. It's frolicking and wallowing in it's own blood. Intellectual hypocrisy in my book. You can't have it both ways. I have a problem with violent films that are proselytizing against the very violence that they are depicting. The villain in this film is depicted as an anti-hero. Bardem is made-up to look like some romantic medieval villain or hero. Maybe he respresents Prince Valiant or Robin Hood with that obnoxious hairdo and his strange game of chance. The depictions of brutal violence negate the message of the film. ""Do as I say, not as I do?"" SILENCE OF THE LAMBS depicted the very same intellectual hypocrisy, and won an Oscar for it. (Contrary to what The Academy or your teenage Emo son believes, Hannibal Lector is not a hero.) This will probably win one too. What a shame. But, I'm not buying into it.<br /><br />I actually enjoy films with violent content as long as it serves the story in some fashion. All this film has to offer is a double barreled shotgun sandwich, some depressing dimestore symbolism at the end, and no real resolution.<br /><br />(SPOILER) THE METAPHORICAL ENDING FOR THOSE WHO DIDN'T GET IT: Evil survives when Bardem walks away. Good, metaphorically represented by Jones and his dream, is vanishing. The dream is a premonition of his death, both literally and metaphorically. I don't need the Coen brothers to tell me that good does not always triumph over evil, after splattering the screen with blood. There is nothing new here. ""Genius"" is defined by something that has never been postulated or presented before. The metaphor is old, and it's hardly genius. I get it. I just don't get what it's doing in this bloody lowbrow crime drama.<br /><br />This is not a great transcendent crime drama. It's a bad story mixed with violent sanctimonious self-righteous crud. This film strives for artistic merit, but it's really just another violent cartoon like THE HITCHER. That film was fun. This one was dull. I hated this flick.<br /><br />""We believe in nothing, Lebowski.""<br /><br />Yah, we believe in nothing.""<br /><br />If you want to see The Best Serial Killer film of 2007, see David Fincher's ZODIAC. That's a brilliant film. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a bloody overrated mess.<br /><br />IM, not so HO, this is the worst film The Coen Brothers have ever made. Joel and Ethan Coen deserve a spanking for this. I hope they get back on track with something funny.<br /><br />Apparently, the Critics are not as bright as they appear to be. America really is a dark and depressing place. Not because of this film's reflection of society. But, because films like this are being lionized by the masses as some sort of standard of excellence. Which is a sad reflection of America, in and of itself.<br /><br />Pseudo-Intellectual Nihilistic Hogwash."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	THIS IS A GREAT DVD TO HAVE ON HAND AT OUR HOUSE FOR WHEN THE GRANDKIDS COME TO VISIT.  FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I missed this mini searies when it was out. It was full of history in a great story so of way. The actors did a great job. I purchased it used for less than it would of cost me to rent all three disks. Plus no one had it in the area to rent also.
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	Some of the other Potter films have been successful stripped down 'bare bones' versions of the incredible book series of the same names. Order of the Phoenix however is very different. It's more of the 'bare skin' version. The 'bones' if you will- the true story- is completely lost in this film. The visual side is wonderful- the characters are great- the sets are spot on (thus the two stars) but the storyline is truly trash. What should have been a very powerful story of Harry finally taking up arms against Voldemort is turned into a messed up action movie with almost no followable storyline. Virtually ALL the key elements that gave the entire book substance are not even 'improperly done'- they're just completely left out. Even when you watch the deleted scenes and behind the scenes on the bonus disk- it's as if the entire interview ensemble  are aimed at people who were too lazy to read the books or too dumb to follow the story. It's a bunch of adults acting like they're talking down to simple minded viewers. If a person watching the movie is one that's never picked up a book- they're simply there to think the movie is 'finally getting good' because of special effects and spell flinging. But the ilk that would actually READ and LOVE Harry Potter are not simpletons- they're literate kids AND adults and shouldn't have to be softly spoken to as if the finer points of the entire series are lost to them.<br /><br />I want to LOVE every Harry Potter movie the way I LOVE the books- and so far it's been a fulfilling and great experience to see the movies (no matter what they've had to leave out) but this is just a horrible adaptation of J.K.'s books. I can only assume that the screen writer, Michael Goldenberg,is who's truly to blame.<br /><br />If you've been putting off reading the books and strictly relying on the movies to follow the epic story of Harry Potter- this is a prime time to pick up the true version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (the BOOK) and figure out all that you've missed by watching this wretchedly hollow interpretation. And as the 'bonus disk' is treated with so much recap nonsense and fluff that only a five year old would find acceptable (every 'bonus' is either done like an episode of Elmo meets: or softly speaking adults who act as if they're talking to either toddlers or an elderly person on their deathbed who can't focus long enough to watch a movie)- only buy the core version if you feel the NEED to own all the Harry Potter movies.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I really enjoy ordering products from Amazon. I enjoyed this movie very much.  It was delivered to me in about three days.  I also like to be able to order products in advance before they are published.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"As Boston pulp fiction, The Departed is second only to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VTTRC6"">Mystic River</a>,and that's saying a lot. In the growing genre of movies that seem to have grown out of the facination with Whitey Bulger and the Winter Hill gang, it's really very good at capturing the big picture, while Mystic River confined itself to the local neighborhoods. The intricate dance is well portrayed here, and you need to pay close attention to fully get it.<br /><br />Anyone growing up in Boston knows a few guys who have a little something going on the side...but they are not really gangsters...just buddies who sometimes have few choices if the intricate system of favors owed and payments made breaks down. They haven't the command structure of the Sopranos crew, or the control over events that comes with hierarchy. They live from day to day, and their survival depends on knowing what happened last night, and how it changes things for them today. Mystic River really got it, but that's no surprise because Lehane was a local. The Southie Projects and tenements gave birth to a gritty inner city life style that resembles Philly or Providence. Forget the stereotypical silk suits and McMansions; instead walk the streets of  Southie with guys who still live at home in tenements, giving grief to a family of lawyers and priests. Jack Nicholson resembles more than a few people you can still find back in the neighborhood. The ending is unpredictable, and like real life, unexpected...until you remember that it's ALL personal in this Boston web of lies and deceit.<br /><br />Out of staters won't get the full impact of the State Police / Boston PD / FBI rivalry and mistrust, but there are some very good reasons for them not to trust each other, or themselves, as locals know. The FBI encourages (and protects?) informants, while the Staties have their own intelligence operations going, and the Boston PD has first hand street level knowledge of what's REALLY happening. Agendas are bound to conflict.<br /><br />In this movie, as in real life on the streets, everybody owes somebody, and eventually everybody pays."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	My husband and I did not get to see this series on TV and we are glad we didn't. It is sooo good we viewed it together over the weekend when we received it. If we had had to wait a week between episodes I think my husband would have hurt somebody. Paul G. should definitely get an Emmy and so should Laura L. for her portrayel of Abigail.<br />If you like history, especially American history, this is a must see and a must have!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Oh my gosh, I am not certain who loves this movie more - us or our children.  My two year old smiles from ear to ear every time we put it in to play.  More astonishing, my 7 month old laughes, giggles and smiles throughout the entire DVD - he loves Mator and Lightening!  Truly a great movie.  Witty, charming and adults will LOVE it too!  We know it word for word! We will even watch it afte rthey have gone to bed!  Love it!  Children of all ages will love it!  It keeps things calm when we need to take care of household responsibilities! Enjoy!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Good Movie and Picture. Recommend this over regular DVD's (or HD-DVD) if you have a Blu - Ray Player !!!! (1080 P movie, very clear)
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB4W0W"">True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)</a><br />As I love all things supernatural, horror-ific, and paranormal, I absolutely got hooked on this DVD set.

B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	delivery time was great, this is a xmas pressie so have not watch them yet, we know that these are just hilarious, so cant wait to watch them
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	The Food, Inc. story is interesting and insightful but only tells part of the story. It is certainly something people need to know. I have a bison ranch in Colorado and raise totally grass-fed bison so I have been aware of the issues with the Corporate feedlots. I am glad to see more and more people becoming concerned about their health and about the food they eat.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This man is incredible.  If you want a great laugh out loud fest, this is the one.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	i was very pleased with both products and even more with the swiftness  of delivery for i am in australia in a fishing port which not the easiest to get to ,, thankyou again .. will shop again soon
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	A good start for a new season. Not one of those series i could watch over and over and over again, but it is definatly somthing i am addicted to and i will watch all seasons. I have already read the books so i am looking forward to the seasons to come.
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	When the characters weren't busy whispering or mumbling (for dramatic effect I imagine, but failed miserably by just being annoying), they were simply showing poor acting skills (not what I would have expected from this ensemble). The movie dragged and left me wishing they would just get to the end already. A good premise that was poorly executed.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	My husband and I took our 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter to this movie and it was the most magical time we ever shared together.  This film is for the child who is 1 to 101.  After seeing this movie, I too BELIEVE!
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	This movie is what you would get if you took Michael Moore and brainwashed him with fundamentalist Christian propaganda. It's not convincing to anyone but the people who already believe evolution is a sham (and if they need a movie to validate their beliefs, their beliefs probably weren't that strong in the first place), and it just alienates everyone else by blindly attacking evolution instead of using reason and logic to debate it. I feel sorry for the pro-evolution people who were interviewed because their words were twisted to serve a different purpose. I would not recommend this movie to anyone at all. Seriously. This movie is not worth the packaging it comes in.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Easily the best movie I have seen in years and years. Maybe the best movie made since Boogie Nights (1997). Another Scorsese masterpiece so far above regular film making that it reduces the standard Hollywood release to be equivalent with TV commercials; that is to say mindless junk<br /><br />Perfect casting, acting, directing, screenplay - perfect everything. This is a movie you will want to re-watch for years. Maybe the best thing about this movie is that ending is not sappy and predictable. I could probably write 1500 words about this film but ultimately, it is a movie that creates a reality for the viewer and that is the goal of any film. A must see classic.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	There's nothing really left to be said about the film itself that hasn't been said before.  It's a a great film that is great for all ages, but has plenty of metaphors that adults may be able to enjoy.  However, what really needs to be said is just how great this film looks on blu-ray.  The audio quality on this film is top notch and the visuals in this film, they were stunning even on dvd but on blu-ray, they look awesome.  The best looking scene would have to be the Voldemort/Dumbledore duel, the flying glass just looks stunning.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind however is that many of Warner's bd films don't have a traditional menu, and Phoenix is one of those films.  So the minute you pop it in the player, it'll go straight to the film. And unlike Half Blood Prince, the coding on this transfer allows auto resume and the load time is much quicker.  However, unlike HBP, there's no BD-Live features.
B004JMSIRC	2.0	b	It has quite a few funny dialogues. The plot has depth. It shows the weaknesses of Ironman. For example, he recovered from alcohol addiction. It makes him more human. The special effects are so-so. It's worth seeing once.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Wonderful movie, as all Harry Potter movies are.  We like it on bluray better than DVD.  Can't wait for part 2!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself is VERY funny!!!<br />Peanut, Jose and Walter are my favorite characters!<br />This DVD is particularly well done.  Was disappointed<br />though that the outtakes sound did not work properly.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KEGR8Y"">Jeff Dunham: Arguing with Myself [Blu-ray</a>]"
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	When I heard the film was going to be unreasonably short, I was afraid the movie would suffer. Not so. While many fans are angry that so much of the book was not included, as a MOVIE, this is the best in the Harry Potter series by far. Better acting, better pacing, better all-around. I don't understand why thirty minutes couldn't have been added, but other than that,  it is definitely a crowd pleaser.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Then this is a great set to get! It includes a version of the hard to find and expensive Rescue Mater, which if your kid has seen the Mater Tales cartoons, they will want BADLY. The Gold McQueen is nice too and goes great with the gold Mia and Tia that were available with Bling Bling McQueen in a three pack a few years ago. My kid is nuts about Cars and likes playing with the little diecast cars put out by Mattel so this was a no brainer buy for us.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	I'm not from SoCal, so I can't comment on the BK product placement (which was so obvious as to be perhaps intentionally ludicrous?) I would definitely go for In-and-Out waaaay before BK, whether or not I'd been in an Afghani cave for 3 months.<br /><br />I've never read the comic book, and never been that much into them anyway. This is definitely not the semi-plausible superhero (Batman) nor is it the completely implausible (X-Men). That leaves the techno-superheroes: Iron Man. I'm not sure which I find more implausible. But I must admit a buff Robert Downey Jr. is better eye candy than Toby McGuire. That, of course, could easily lead to a super-hero comparison via the eye-candy factor.<br /><br />What seemed a bit lurching was the pace of the beginning and end. The beginning is slow, but not unpleasantly ('get to know the cast of characters and understand the hero's tragic flaws'). But it seemed to be rushing towards the end - fast paced action, sure - but this seemed like someone abruptly realized it was already min.120 and counting, and had to hurry to end it.  Sad, because I was still enjoying it.<br /><br />Downey was spectacular as the nascent superhero, developing the new suit. A childish joy immediately squashed by Newtonian physics. Childish, yet thoroughly amusing consequences (several squashed cars).<br /><br />Script?  ok<br />Direction?  ok<br />FX?  good<br />Robert Downey?  totally makes the movie.  He inhabits the part.  Nothing else is really that spectacular, but you don't notice being so engrossed with him.<br /><br />Elizabeth's rating: 2<br />The special effects are better on the big screen
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I went into Cars with not very high expectations. I don't know why considering Pixar has a perfect batting average when it comes to making good films. Perhaps it was the unbelievably high amount of negative reviews I was reading about the film. In the end, I think this was a good thing as it allowed me to watch a movie that would surpass my expectations, and I love it when a movie is better than I expect.<br /><br />The first thing you need to know about Cars is that it's an abstract fantasy. Much of the criticism I hear is about how the film's setting doesn't make sense logically. Here we have a world populated by cars which feature accomodations such as doors and seats for humans that don't exist. I find this a silly thing to get hung up on as it has no bearing on the story of the film which uses personified cars as clever characterizations of people.<br /><br />The film opens up strong and engages you right from the beginning. I hate NASCAR, but I had no problem enjoying the visuals of the film's openning race that would serve to tell the motive of the main character, Lightning McQueen, as well as set up the conflict he would have to overcome.<br /><br />The story itself is completely unoriginal and full of cliche, but this does not detract much from the film. Even if feel at points that you've been there, seen that, you really haven't due to the interesting twist of the movie's unique setting (cars instead of people in case you haven't been following along). You also haven't seen this story (Doc Hollywood) done so well. Were this a serious drama, the cliche and stereotypes that are rampant in the film would be a negative, but as a comedy they only add to the film's characterization of Americana and society.<br /><br />The pleasure in this film isn't wondering what's going to happen next. In deed, the film is entirely predictable, but fitting to the theme of the movie it's a great ride. Lightning McQueen starts off as a hot shot racing car celebrity who ends up trapped in a small town and ends up learning what's important in life. The pleasure is in watching the growth and development of the main character on his journey to enlightenment (read: not being a self-centered, egotistical moron) and all the encounters with the story's other denizens along the way.<br /><br />Much like Ellen Degeneres did in Finding Nemo, Larry the Cable Guy steals the show as the lovable tow truck named Mater. You don't have to be a fan to appreciate his performance. And Luke Wilson has become a master at making the unlikable-ignorant-jerk likable.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much children will enjoy this film. It's slow in parts much like The Incredibles was, but unlike that film it doesn't have the big action scenes as pay off. The film is definately good for kids and teaches morals such as 'it's not whether you win or lose but how you play that matters.' However, the overall story seems more aimed at adults. Still, I didn't hear any kids complaining at my trip to the theatre so don't be concerned about taking them.<br /><br />Pixar returns to it's roots with the same style film as Toy Story 1 & 2. It also keeps with it's tradition of being an impeccable movie studio that never fails to impress. Cars is another homerun for the studio and easily one of the best films of the year.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This guy is EXTREMELY talented and HILARIOUS.  Be prepared for a side ache from laughing.  I wish he had other versions for sell!  I plan on buying more of this copy for gifts.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	creo que no hay palabras para describir esta pelicula.tan maravillosa....con ese toque de cine negro que tanto necesitamos actualmente...con un elenco super espectacular.... nos cuentan varias historias que se entrelazan de una forma unica...excelente direccion..con una fotografia impecable..una pelicula muy recomendable a quienes  gustan del comics y del cine negro.. olvidado actualmente por hollywood...<br /><br />saludos
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Even if only half of what is in this documentary is true, this is a staggering expose of the American food industry. Beyond the indefensibly cruel way we treat other living creatures is the realization of that our own craving for cheap, fast food is undermining our health in very dangerous ways, not just by making us obese, but by creating new, antibiotic resistant strains of eColi and other pathogens. The small American farmer is under attack as well. While I admit I'm a vegetarian and so may be biased, I'm vowing to buy more organic whenever I can. If I wasn't a vegetarian already, this documentary would have convinced me to become one, although I do think the film gives a fair shake to organic farmers who raise livestock and isn't necessarily pro-veg. Everyone should see this film!
B0006989TE	2.0	b	Quite frankly, I feel cheated after seeing this movie, because the trailers made it look like a total hell-raiser scary movie that would surpass MNS's The Sixth Sense and Signs. It must be the huge success of Signs that caused Hollywood to obligate MNS to come up a new movie ASAP, even if he hasn't written a great script. Ultimately, he managed to put in his usual twisted ending to the story that made it a total different kind of movie, and it's no longer a horror film!<br />Big stars like Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt had insignificant roles in this movie, and it was totally wasted their time. Fresh off his Oscar Winning The Pianist, Adrian Brody found nothing more interesting than playing a small part(a retarded villager who dressed up as a monster to scare off any one from going into the wood, so that they will always stay in the village(the 1800's) away the the world(modern time). It's totally unworthy of his appearance in this film, because he doesn't speak, and his role requires him to deliver 10% of what he did in The Pianist.<br />By the time the young blind heroine seeked her way to the outter world to obtain medicine, and encounter a police on the street, that's when the big twist comes in. I mean, even when monster(Brody) got killed in the woods, and it was already an indication that there was no monster, and the village is simply victims of surcumstances from the outside world, and that they chose to abandon it for good.<br />Now the reason I was disappointed by this movie is 1: great cast for the poor characters. 2: poor plot made it looked like MNS got his feet on two boats at the same time. I guess if I didn't expect it to be a horror, then I probably give one more star.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	It was a fine movie, it felt like indie to me.  It wasn't exactly the story I expected, but it looked like they had a fun time making it and I had a fun time watching it.  blu-ray was totally worth it.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Warning: this is the most cruelly violent and intense movie to come down the pike in a while - some of the meanest, most detestable characters you'll ever encounter in a story. Yet, if you can handle it, the plot is brilliantly conceived  and developed in this film.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This is a fabulous Movie, and it is certain to change your life. This documentary explains some of the reasons not previously disclosed for our national problems with weight gain. This shows how apparently up to 90% of our soybeans are controlled by a chemical company, and are apparently sprayed with roundup as they grow. We need to understand what is happening with the food supply, and how it affects us as well as the animals and crops. Excellent. The realistic parts are tough showing actual animals but those parts are short. See the entire film and you will make changes in your life for the better.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	What can you say about the Marvel Universe when it comes to life on the big screen (with the exception of X-Men 3).  Another triumph - especially with RDJ playing Tony Stark.  The guy is just that great and believable.  You can follow the storyline from beginning to end and there are no character flaws that I can see.  If you liked Iron Man as a kid, this is going to blow you away.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	I was expecting this movie to be a lot better. When I saw the previews it looked sick. It was alright though.
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	I should have known, the academy has a track record...they pick the obvious, the action, but not the really good movies.<br /><br />Some of the actors were really good...the movie was a C at best.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	A must see for all family members. Very cute movie. Bought for my son for Easter, and he loved it.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	It is a good series which take us to the origins of the United States History. The body of the film is a bit slow, but it is still worth enough seeing.
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	Great series, some of the actors aren't great, but overall the series is fun, entertaining, and has me hooked. It's not a fine work of art but it is enjoyable and if you like vampires then I highly recomend checking it out.

B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. ""Sin City"" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes ""Sin City,"" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike ""Sky Captain,"" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three ""Sin City"" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is not quite a ""Kill Bill"" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. ""Sin City"" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. An outstanding piece of work."
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	"With the exception of Walberg, the all-star cast preformed their roles beautifully. The issues at hand are the muddled script, the confusing casting and the unacceptable ending.<br /><br />There is little distinction between Matt Damon and Decaprio who sported the same crew-cut, body build, facial expressions and distracting accent. They looked so similar that I constantly had to remind myself who was who. Damon was a bad guy pretending to be a cop. Decaprio was a cop pretending to be a bad guy. At the rolling of the credit I was left wondering who Jack Nicolsen really was. The number of secret FBI informants in this movie is ridiculous and insulting. That fact only becomes evident at the end when heads explode unexpectedly and more bodies pile up, leaving the viewer feeling cheated. It was like watching a bad comedy. You may find yourself screaming ""Are you kidding me?"" at the TV screen.<br /><br />The girlfriend has no reason for being in this film, except to add the element of romance and sex. Her presence did nothing to propel this movie forward.<br /><br />This is a Scorsese film. Expect a lot of swearing, violence and blood and gore. I haven't removed any rating stars because of it.  The Departed is a mind-boggling, cluttered puzzle that fails to piece together at the end."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This is a must have item in any movie collection that includes any action titles.  One of the best movies of the year.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	watched it at the theater, if you were in to the comic books as a kid, or still are you may find that it not like the comic book, but some of us who are still in to the comic's and do like a good movie, and yes it was good.<br />and yes I've been on the preorder list for a while now.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Bought this for my 3 year odl son who LOVES it.  It arrived very quickly in excellent condition.  We watch it a lot especially when he refuses to take a nap but he will lay on the couch to rest and watch this movie.  Awesome movie.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"The acting is fine and top notch. The cinematography is gorgeous, setting vibrant yellows, reds and greens against a gray and brown backdrop.  The first 20 mintues or so are suspenseful and scary.  Then it clods along, turning into a love story.  Not a bad thing if that was how The Village was marketed.  Instead, it was pushed as a horror film and let me tell you the scares are few and far between. The secret ""twist"" is reviewed about an hour in and then there's another half hour to go just to drive the point home.  I pretty much had the ""twist"" figured out about 40 minutes in and let me tell you, it's pretty disappointing.  The Village doesn't reach the clever heights of the Sixth Sense or the suspenseful thrills of Signs, instead it starts off hot but when the ""twist"" is revealed it's lukewarm at best.  See it but be warned.  2 1/2 stars."
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	I've just finished watching the DVD version of this movie and have to agree with earlier commenters.<br /><br />It is a TERRIBLE transfer -- the worst I've ever seen in a major release -- especially during the darker scenes, and scenes with static backgrounds.  The quality is so bad I was actually wondering if I might have somehow received a bootleg DVD -- until I remembered that I had ordered straight from Amazon.  Even the legalistic warnings at the beginning and end are fuzzy and grainy.<br /><br />I too have to conclude this was intentional, and feel cheated and disrespected by the studio.  I suppose I am playing right into their hands in writing this, for my review will probably cause some people to now skip the DVD and buy the more expensive Blu-ray.<br /><br />This release is really inexcusable.<br /><br />This is a shame, as the movie itself is very, very good.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	John Adams (HBO Miniseries) is a most beautiful depiction of American History presenting the trials, tribulations and joys experienced by Our Founding Fathers during their passionate pursuits to develop a Free Nation and ultimately implementing The Constitution of the United States of America, as her Foundation.<br /><br />American History, as seen through the eyes of John Adams, the first<br />Vice-President of the United States to General George Washington and America's second President, is portrayed by brilliant and most believable actors (especially John Adams and his wife, Abigal) in magnificant, realistic scenery - a pleasurable way to learn facts of the birthing of this Great American Nation.<br /><br />Intimate presentation of their united struggles to secure personal freedoms and dignity, their own, and for those of all future citizens, leaves one with a much deeper appreciation and genuine love for Our Founding Father's unselfish and tireless efforts.<br /><br />For anyone like me, who slept through History 101, promise this film keeps your eyes wide open and instills a longing for more knowledge, facts and more History of the United States of America.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Excellent movie, great PQ and AQ, no reaching for remote. Colors are accurate throughout, crisp, clear, no blocking or artifacts. The Audio is DD, TrueHD etc.. and is very clean, tight and mixed well. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job along with the others cast. The Live Update took about 30secs on my connection so I guess it's varied. This one is a buy and will be a great addition to your collection, you won't be disappointed. I have not perused the 2nd Bonus disc yet, will update then.<br /><br />J.A. Brony
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I pre-ordered this DVD after watching the first season on HBO, and I could barely wait for them to release it! I would agree with other reviewers that the cast is the best part of the series - every actor is top-notch, and every one of them is perfect for the role they are in. Anna Paquin as Sookie is a delight, but really everyone is well worth watching, and I find myself excited to see even the minor characters in each episode. If I had to pick a favorite, I would say that Nelson Ellis as Lafayette is it.<br /><br />For those of you who have read the Sookie Stackhouse novels, there are definite changes from the books to the series. I am a fan of the books, but I still like what the writers have done in adapting the novels, since it would be boring to just follow Sookie everywhere, and because many other more minor characters are fleshed out, such as Jason, Tara, Hoyt Fortenberry, Andy Bellefleur, Terry Bellefleur, Arlene, etc. What results is clearly based on the books but expanded and developed to make for a delightful, passionate, and action-packed season. Watching the series after having read the books can be difficult, since you know what 'should' happen, but I found that I wasn't ever disappointed by any changes.<br /><br />I've enjoyed watching the extras, but the commentary is not something I like, since it goes over the dialogue of the episodes.<br /><br />A note for those who might not be familiar with the content of the series - it has many mature themes, with sex and violence, but I found that it is quite tasteful and meant to convey the key ideas of the series. Just a warning - not for children!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"Got it on the day i expected. Packaged nicly. No problems. I did the first day, which is just the FITNESS test and im already feeling it. I can definitely tell every penny will be worth it as long as i stick with it. I took my before pictures and i absolutely cant wait to see the results after 60 days! NOTTTT sure why were paying $15 more through Amazon when its listed for $119.85 on the beachbdy website. Kind of feel like im being taken advantage of. Anyway, i definitely feel like im on a ""runner's high"" i wouldnt reccommend doing this at night :)"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	The product got here when it was supposed to, and everything was in perfect condition.  I couldn't have asked for anything more.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	I've just started collecting BR's right after I bought my PS3 and I wish I had been purchasing them sooner. I also have the standard dvd of this movie and the difference between dvd and br is phenomenal. Blu Ray FTW!
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"This movie was a complete waste of time. I remember there being much hype about it because it came from the same man that did The Sixth Sense.<br /><br />The hype was not well deserved. This movie actually put me to sleep; two times! Luckily, I checked it out from the library and did not waste my money on it at the video store.<br /><br />The ""twist"" at the end is great, like all of M. Night's movies, but by the time you get to it, you won't really care. The pace is very slow and dull, much like everything about this movie.<br /><br />Verdict: Don't waste your time"
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	I am a grandfather who initially read Harry Potter to see what had captured the imagination of my grandchildren.  Rowling is an outstanding author and has created what in my opinion is a masterpiece.  I have now read all of the books and have seen all of the movies -- and I have enjoyed every one.  This latest film was a huge challenge to the screenwriter and director due to the sheer size of the book.  In this film we see Harry, Hermione, and Ron as near adults -- ready to graduate and certainly with much greater maturity and mastery of magic.  Certainly each movie gets darker and darker as do the books as Harry and friends encounter the growing evil of Valdemort.<br /><br />This was not the best of the series of films but it keeps the story moving.  The director has clearly elected to capture the essence of the story rather than to follow all of the details, which would have made an impossibly long movie.  However, for those who have never read the book, the movie moves along well.  For those who have read the book, they can fill in the details without having to see them on the screen.  The result is many of the major characters have relatively small parts in this movie.  In fact outside of Harry, Ron, and Hermione virtually all of the characters have small parts -- still the story moves along very well and you don't see the time pass.  I really liked the movie, I highly recommend it, it is probably not a movie for very young children because it shows the characters in some dangerous and threatening situations.  I only gave 4 stars because it is an abreviated version of the story -- but still well done.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"Harry returns for his fifth year of study at Hogwarts and discovers that much of the wizarding community has been denied the truth about the teenager's recent encounter with the evil Lord Voldemort. Fearing that Hogwarts' venerable Headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, is lying about Voldemort's return in order to undermine his power and take his job, the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, appoints a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher to keep watch over Dumbledore and the Hogwarts students. But Professor Dolores Umbridge's Ministry-approved course of defensive magic leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them and the entire wizarding community, so at the prompting of his friends Hermione and Ron, Harry takes matters into his own hands. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves ""Dumbledore's Army,"" Harry teaches them how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.<br />Dark and well crafted movie."
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	my boys LOVE this movie.  they would watch it everyday if we would let them.  my husband and i also enjoyed the movie tremendously.  it is really well done and has enough adult humor to keep us entertained through multiple viewings.  definitely recommend it!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This was the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. The service was great and it came in in plenty of time to give to friends and family for christmas. I will order again with out a problem.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Dunham's act is a wicked, guilty-pleasure crack-up. His boyish, All-American good looks and embarrassed astonishment at the antics, histrionics, and outrageous remarks tumbling out of Peanuts ""mouth"" will have you hiding behind the couch cushions in hysterics, hoping your PC friends don't catch you laughing at loud at comments you would never dare make yourself.  This is hilarious good fun.  Dunham is extremely talented and very, very witty.  His act might not fly if he was just a stand-up,  but the out-of-the-mouths-of-babes quality to his characters vocalizations makes it all wildly funny and acceptble."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I enjoyed this documentary.  It exposes the hypocrisy and flawed thinking behind the evolution movement.  It may not change the mind of those who have been indoctrinated in evolutionary thinking since childhood but it may give insight on the subject to those who are open to new ideas or who haven't been able to totally swallow the dogma of the secularist left.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	I found this a very difficult movie to rate. I wanted so badly to give it a five because of the movie itself, but I also wanted to give the Unrated edition a three for the package, as it is very disappointing. So, I settled on a solid four. Here's why.<br /><br />Firstly, Sin City as a movie alone was excellent. It was innovative and almost as good as my absolute favorite movie Pulp Fiction, and this I believe is because the two are so much alike. Sin City doesn't even try to explain itself. The characters ramble on in moments of deep thought, revealing what makes them tick. It's filled to the brim with Arnold-esque one-liners. The surreal style of this film makes all the characters seem like super heroes of sorts (not strange, considering Frank Miller, the god of American comics, created this series). In fact, everything that happens in this movie would make other movies bad. Who wants to listen to the thoughts of a character, something that's usually left in books? Yet in Sin City it words. Who still likes Arnold one-liners, what with all those Arnold impressions going on anymore? Obviously, Frank Miller, and so do his fans. Who wants surrealism in their movies? Anyone who likes super hero movies, which record tells a lot of people. All this comes together to make Sin City the all-time greatest comic-book movie.<br /><br />Now, for the Sin City Uncut edition, the only true bonus here is the graphic novel, which I have yet to read myself (review coming later). It gives you the chance to see just how innovative the movie Sin City is, and how true the directors wanted to keep the movie to the book. After that, there is little to keep my interest. Some of the special features found here should have been included in the first edition of Sin City, which I foolishly wasted my money on not knowing this edition was coming. Plus, unless you watch both versions of the movie back to back, you'll never be able to tell which scenes were added. The breakdown of stories so that you can watch them singularly doesn't add anything. It's jarring, actually, since it breaks the rhythm the original version followed.<br /><br />In the end, I can't recommend this movie to anyone who has the original version. If you don't have that version, however, pick this up quick. It is still a superior version, only not by much.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	This is a good film. Though not as good nor does it hold the suspense, action, drama, and climax of the others, this still was a decent movie. The most far fetched scene and obviously unrealistic is in the beginning of the film when Indy hides in a refrigerator and escapes a Nuclear blast.  All the refrigerators in the entire town are blown to smithereens (as expected from a Nuclear blast), but somehow Indy's flies and bounces all over the place, and yet he emerges unharmed without a scratch on him. Unrealistic!!<br /><br />Besides this the film was decent and I purchased a copy and have watched it twice thus far. Wont watch it as much as the others, but glad I bought it.<br /><br />C+ rating
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	I have to agree with all who were disappointed with this movie. Some things just didn't make a lot of sense to me. If the guy didn't go back to give some dying guy a drink or water then he would have never been caught. What fool who finds 2 million dollars goes back to the scene of the crime??? He deserved everything he got for being so damn stupid.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"What's the difference between A-list actors and B-list actors?<br /><br />An A-list actor can be in many different movies, and most of the A-list actor's performances are memorable. However, each performance is remembered for its individuality.<br /><br />A B-list actor turns in forgettable performances, and usually isn't in a lot of movies (that are good).<br /><br />Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio and especially Jack Nicholson reaffirm their A-list status with flying colors in The Departed. How many movies have you seen Jack Nicholson in? How after being in so many movies can you keep your performances fresh? My expectation was that I'd go into The Departed and have an experience where the Nicholson character was unoriginal, familiar or unbelievable because the portrayal would be so diluted by other Nicholson performances. So much for my expectation.<br /><br />Nicholson's portrayal of Frank Costello was realistic and refreshing. You don't see Jack Nicholson ""in another role""; you see Frank Costello. That's an A-list actor.<br /><br />The movie as a whole was just excellent. A great story. Engrossing. Believable. Suspenseful. And the twists were on target; even though you mostly knew who the rats were and what side they were on, the deceptions effectively keep the viewer slightly confused as to who is really working for who. The movie keeps you captivated from start to finish.<br /><br />The Departed and its Director have been justifiably showered with praise and awards. The Departed is by far the best new movie that I've seen in years. It's a collector; add it to your cart."
B002QZ1RS6	3.0	b	"I borrowed Insanity from a friend before buying and am not going to purchase the set.  Insanity is definitely for the hard core athlete.  I have been running and completed other Beachbody workout routines, so I thought I could handle Insanity.  After only 15 minutes of the Cardio Plyo DVD, my knees were damaged.  The cardio workouts consist of boring repetitive running in place, jumping jacks, butt kicks, mummy kicks, high knees, that's about all.  The abs and arms are push ups, planks, burpees, and ""c-sits"", mixed with some more jumping around.  The music is background at best.  I also don't recommend trying to do these workouts on carpet.<br /><br />I'm sure, if you can handle the workouts and don't injure yourself, you will see results.  If you are into football camp or high-school boys PE class,  you may like Insanity.  For me, life is too short to hate my workouts."
B0006989TE	2.0	b	I dont know what all the hype is about surrounding M. Night Shyamalan's films. So far ive seen Signs and recently The Village- Neither of these films impressed me or scared me. This movie was long, boring and Not at all scary. Why is this man praised as a director? He shoots scenes of the woods for like 10 min straight. Yea , like that adds atmosphere. The monster in the red cape was laughable. The ending was so predictable and done before that you ask yourself is this it? Very long tedious and boring. Uneventful , Not scary. Ridiculous dialoge. Same with the ending in M. Night Shymalan's Signs. Stay far away from M. Night Shyamalan's films unless you want to be bored out of your mind.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull will satisfy those fans of endless action.  Some of the action is beyond believability.  What made the previous films enjoyable was the element of realism with just the right amount of fantasy.  Finding a way to evade the rolling boulder is more plausible than surviving Ground Zero in a refrigerator.  This is just one example.  I was beginning to think Indy was more Wile E. Coyote than anything else.<br /><br />It would have been better to see Indy think his way out of situations in an entertaining manner.  Think of the would be Scimitar Fight scene in Raiders.  This would be appropriate since Indiana Jones is 18 years older and should be wiser by that much.<br /><br />The film would have been more effective with Indy and just one other person in his party.  His party had a clunky Dungeons and Dragons feel to it.  It could have been John Hurt, Karen Allen, Shia Labouef, the other archeologist, but JUST one of them would have been sufficient for this film.<br /><br />As for the bad guys...  Cate Blanchette is a fine actress, but not for this role.  I was reminded more of Boris Badenov and Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle than a fearsome Soviet agent.  There are many fine Eastern European actresses that could have played this role.  Her party could have been pared down as well.  The Soviets seemed to be less efficient and more comic than the Nazis in Raiders.<br /><br />This film was enjoyable for the action and chase sequences.  The ending was a pleasant one.  No more sequels though.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	My wife and I decided to give this a shot after she watched the infomercial on tv.  I try to keep in shape but had slacked off at the start of winter.  We have one week left and I must say it is insane!  I've lost around 28 pounds, which is what I wanted to do.  I am a big guy, didn't buy this to get toned, I will never look like one of people shown, but I got through it and happy I did.  Followed workout all way through (missed a few days...opps) and ate smart (low calorie intake).  My feet were killing me at first as I was using running shoes, had to pick up a pair of cross trainers...same w/wife.  Other then that, first few days were hell, then it got better...can't do each set as long as they do in video, but they tell you to do what you can...you'll get better.  Shaun T is a cool dude and it never got old (except the music!)  You have to be in somewhat good shape or I think you would drop out right away.  Happy we made the investment!  One more week insanity and i'll be sending for my free shirt!!!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Contrary to the person who reviewed that this was in aspect ratio of 1:33, it is NOT--it is in full HIGH DEF 2.4 1920x1080 with 7.1 Dolby Digital sound.<br />It is gorgeous--they did a wonderful job with lighting, effects, etc.  We have both the Widescreen regular version as well as this Blu Ray and it's a world of difference.  Of course, with Blu Ray, you see SO much more, but even I was surprised with how much more crisp an animated picture could be.<br />The movie itself is cute--has a GREAT message, and of course, lots of adult humor mixed in with the kids' stuff.  Great movie for all ages.  Gotta have a Blu-Ray player--whether it be a PS3 or a separate unit, it's a must-have for any HD home.<br />Oh, and the soundtrack is great, too!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I bought the departed because it's an amazing classic and the special edition 2 disc was well with it, and it shipped fast too.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	This is one of my favorite movies!  It has an excellent cast of characters played by Hurt, Weaver, Phoenix, Brody and let us not forget Bryce Dallas Howard - the daughter of Ron Howard.  It is an original story that could be taken right out of the headlines of the 6 o'clock news.  It is a light thriller with a great story and I don't think it falls apart at the end at all.  It is also a fantastic love story of sorts with unique characters not often seen in movies...(blind young women and Noah, a special needs individual).  It is definitely worth a look if you are a follower of these actors.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I was not sure what to expect of this movie, but I was assuming it would be at least decent because I am a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio. It was an amazing movie. My younger brother, age 13, loved the movie and we had re-watched the movie three times for a day, and watched it again for the next.<br />The producer did a great job of connecting the characters to the theories of Freud. I had not read the boo so i can not determine if he had stay true to it. However, the movie was great and completely different from what I had originally though, especially the ending. My brother and I very much so recommend watching this movie.
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	Excellent comedy video drags just a little with some addition side scenes but overall very funny. Jeff is quick and very funny.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	This was a hit for the family!  Lots of mystery and suspense.  Great acting and of course smooth delivery to the big screen.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	I assume that #1 was building up to #2? Not much action in this one. I guess they figured the franchise sells itself. I hope #23 is where they spent the money.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Okay, I admit it: my main reason for buying this was that I wanted to lose that extra fat around my mid section (and in some other areas, too).<br />And guess what? I did lose quite a lot of it! A great side effect is of course that your fitness level increases dramatically!<br />Make no mistake, in order for this to happen you really have to work out HARD. The workouts themselves are really advanced and I would not recommend them to someone who isn't at least moderately fit. Now, I thought that I was pretty fit when I started out but I still found it really hard to keep up, especially during the first two weeks. Some of the exercises I had to do more slowly; others, like the power push-ups in the Max workouts I still can do only three or so and then I have to do regular push-ups because I just don't have enough strength.<br />However, tomorrow is my last Max Insanity workout day and I think I will start over again and the next time around I might just conquer those power push-ups, too!<br />The nutrition guide is of course very helpful, however, I was already eating healthy foods to begin with and I already follow most of those guidelines anyway. They are totally right, however, when they say you must eat healthy and wholesome foods if you want to be able to get the full effects of these workouts. You can't do them by eating junk food.<br /><br />In my opinion Insanity is great for people who are willing to work out hard and who want to improve their general fitness level. I know I will keep doing Insanity in months (and hopefully years) to come, no longer six days a week, but 2-3 times per week and mixed up with my running and other workouts at the gym.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Great movie with a great plot. In Blu-ray it looks amazing. I am glad I bought this.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	My 10th grade son needed a series of movies for his US honors history class at school. Our whole family enjoyed sitting down watching this series. In fact I learned alot of historical facts about John Adams and his important role in the Continental Congress and drafting the Declaration of Independence. Some of the language did involve some curse words which was not essential to the movie.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"Please keep in mind that I never write reviews, but I have to write one for this.<br />Also note that I am a female in her early 20's, to help those out. I stand 5'7, and weighed 125lb when I started. I have never worked out in my life, never played sports. I ran occasionally but couldn't even finish a mile.<br /><br />I did my second fit test today, and I feel and look great. The first two to three days hurt my body so much that I could not even get up in the morning to go to work. But I also started drinking the P90X formula and everything started to get better. The first few days, I thought to myself, ""Wow, are you seriously doing this right now because even the people in this DVD look like they're going to give up"" Well I pushed myself. Two weeks in, my upper abs is toned and now my sides are getting toned as well. I have lost four pounds, and about an inch and a half off my waist. My shoulders look toned (they were kind of out of shape before), and I can even do a push up! I had no upperbody strength for the last 22 years of my life, but now, I can do pushups without getting on my knees.<br /><br />Shaun T really pushes you, and you often feel like he's your best friend encouraging you to, it may sound cheesy but, ""dig deeper"". As soon as I started Insanity, I started to watch what I eat, and it definitely shows on the days I do not eat well. I do not feel that same energy after each workout, and it just encourages me to eat better and keep up the good work.<br /><br />I will be updating this review upon my next fit test, but people, you can do it. I never thought I could get out of my size 4 jeans but now I can button a size 2. I feel great, I am starting to look great, and there is nothing wrong about it."
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"Having read all the books in the series I was interested in seeing ""The Order.""  I was and remain happy that so much concern is given to adhering to the essence of the book. Naturally, it is impossible to include in a 2 0r 3 hour movie every detail as laid out by J.K. Rowling but the screenwriter(s) do a masterful job of delivering the true feeling of the book(s)."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"This movie tries to be a conservative version of Michael Moore, and fails miserably.  This movie might be ignored or simply laughed at if it weren't a symptom of the scientific illiteracy in the US.  Among the many failings and falsehoods of this movie are:<br /><br />1. It misrepresents the cases of the people supposedly ""expelled"". (They weren't)<br />2. It displays stunning ignorance of evolution by natural selection (EBNS) and the evidence for it.<br />3. It fails to present any case whatsoever for creationism or its politically-correctly renamed iteration, ""Intelligent Design.""<br />4. The producers approached the scientists who participated under false pretenses.  And they then edited the interviews with these scientists to make them look foolish or sinister.<br />5. It tries to smear EBNS and scientists generally with some completely unsupported connection to the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany. (This ham-handed and disgusting tactic is what drew the most fire from critics.)<br />6. It fails to present the thousands of working scientists, including biologists such as Ken Miller, who are also firm believers in some kind of personal deity.<br /><br />Please search the web for expelledexposed to get the real story behind this movie and the supposedly ""expelled"" academics.  They were not ""expelled""; and this movie spreads bald lies about their situations.  Please also see the NOVA program ""Judgment Day"" about the Dover, PA trial of ID-creationism for the real story of ID (it is religion, not science:  even a conservative GW Bush appointee could clearly see that.)<br /><br />For the record and in accordance with items 2 and 5 above:  Nazi Germany's eugenics, like all eugenics plans, was an artificial selection program, determined by humans.  This is completely different from natural selection.  (Not survival of the fittest; but rather survival of those who are politically-favored.)  And, even if Hitler had invoked Charles Darwin as some kind of justification for his evil deeds (he didn't), he STILL would have been misunderstanding Darwin's idea of EBNS.  Darwin drew a crystal clear distinction between artificial human selection (in for instance the breeding of pigeons and livestock) and the workings of natural selection.  If you read, ""On the Origin of Species"" you will discover that for yourself.<br /><br />In addition:  ID is not science. I've read Behe and Dembski and other ID cdesign proponentsists [sic:  see Of Pandas and People]. They have but a single argument to make (they have no theory, no experiments, no data, no results) and I will summarize it: [Biological feature X] is too complicated for me to understand how it could have evolved, therefore God had to have done it, QED. This is simply a non sequitur. William Dembski's, my, or your lack of intellectual skills or knowledge neither requires nor implies anything about the nature of reality. A federal judge has ruled in detail that ID is religion. Magic explains nothing*. Magic is not science. Incredulity is not science: it is IGNORANCE. Science DISPELS ignorance by hypothesis and testing to find out the FACTS in the case.  (* If magic is allowed, then ANY effect can be equally well asserted to follow ANY cause; all rules of logic and evidence fail, and no conclusions can be drawn.)<br /><br />Why were film clips of Nazi Germany and concentration camps included in this film?  Ben Stein gives us the answer: In an interview with the Trinity Broadcasting Network, Ben Stein said the following amazing things in an interview with Paul Crouch, Jr.<br /><br />Stein: When we just saw that man, I think it was Mr. Myers [i.e. biologist P.Z. Myers], talking about how great scientists were, I was thinking to myself the last time any of my relatives saw scientists telling them what to do they were telling them to go to the showers to get gassed ... that was horrifying beyond words, and that's where science - in my opinion, this is just an opinion - that's where science leads you.<br /><br />Crouch: That's right.<br /><br />Stein: ...Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.<br /><br />Crouch: Good word, good word.<br /><br />That's your Ben Stein. That's what this film is about: trying to discredit science. You know, the discipline that brought you: vaccination, modern medicine, antibiotics, anesthesia, air travel, air conditioning, satellites, cell phones, modern agriculture, safe buildings and bridges. Who needs science?<br /><br />I strongly recommend that you save your money and spend it instead on, for instance:  Neil Shubin's ""Your Inner Fish,"" Matt Ridley's ""Genome,"" of Jared Diamond's ""The Third Chimpanzee."""
B002VRZEYM	3.0	b	"The tenets of mass production have been praised and vilified for their effects on costs.  One camp lauds mass production for its ability to reduce costs and to place goods within the reach of the ordinary consumer.  Another camp criticizes mass production for its ability to hide costs rather than actually reduce them.  Of these two camps, Food, Inc. clearly falls in the latter one.  From a mutated chicken, to unsavory labor practices, to government policies run amok, Food, Inc. has one mission:  to lift the curtain on what is behind our hidden policy of cheap food.<br /><br />Leaning on commentary from Eric Schlosser (author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060838582"">Fast Food Nation</a>) and Michael Pollan (author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143038583"">The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</a>), Food, Inc. largely reiterates what these authors have already put into print.  At least for this reviewer, who read Pollan's book with gusto, there was nothing new here, and this was disappointing.  True, Food, Inc. challenges our labor and agricultural practices with sometimes brutal images, but all in all, it limits itself to retracing Pollan's steps.  In doing so, Food, Inc. merely provides a visual introduction to the characters and scenes Pollan already has described in vivid detail.<br /><br />In some ways, this approach adds a visual layer of depth to Pollan's account of mass produced food in 21st Century America.  In the end, though, the message is still the same:  our policy of cheap food has consequences for society and the individual.  For those who are unaware of what these consequences are, Food, Inc. provides a thorough introduction and challenges you to do something about it.  For those who are familiar with Pollan's book, Food, Inc. is largely reiterative, but appreciably so."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Martin Scorsese should easily finally take home his first Academy Award for Best Director for ""The Departed"". With consummate skill he has assembled bewilderingly complex and varied ingredients: performers, story, settings, photography - with the result being a film that grabs your attention in the first few moments and doesn't let up until the credits roll. The film clocks in at a minute less than 2 1/2 hours. With about 10 minutes left the Mrs. and I shared that we both needed a bathroom break after our half-gallon sodas... but neither of us dared leave.<br /><br />The screenplay, I learn, was adapted by William Monahan from a Hong Kong script by Siu Fai Mak which was translated into English as ""Internal Affairs"". I also read that Mr. Scorsese didn't see the Chinese film but, rather, worked from an English translation of the ""Internal Affairs"" script. The story is a compelling narrative. Mr. Monahan has adapted the story to a Boston setting of Irish cops and gangsters. The dialog is full of sharp, witty one-liners, but also with a realistic, gritty ring of truth. The language reflects the setting of South Boston, not Sesame Street, so if your ears burn with the constant use of profanity - you may want to wait for an ""edited for TV"" version.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a sizzling performance as a Boston ""Southie"" who joins the police force at a tender age, but because of his family (his father was a local tough guy and his uncle a low level mobster)and intelligence(we're told he scored 1400 on his SAT - not usual police recruit material) he is recruited by a secret undercover unit to infiltrate the local mafia. We see him put through a grueling interview by his to-be superiors, Martin Sheen, full of paternal wisdom, and Mark Wahlberg, full of suspicions and vulgarities (but with many of the movie's best moments in a role that is no higher than maybe 5th or 6th billing.) At the same time DiCaprio is being recruited to infiltrate the mob, Matt Damon has been sent by the same mob to join the police force where, with his intelligence, etc, he is soon in a parallel secret unit investigating both his boss, Irish Mobster Frank Costello (in yet another defining performance by Jack Nicholson) and the ""mole"" who it is apparent has infiltrated the police force. (Among the many fine scenes are one where Damon gets to inform Nicholson that he is now leading the investigation to find - himself.)<br /><br />Jack's performance is a Nicholson special. Frank Costello is a nearly untouchable sociopath. (The reason Costello is ""ungettable"" by the Massachusetts police force is one of dozens of intricate twists and sub-plots.) Costello is vulgar and menacing and everyone in Boston quakes in his presence, from local priests to the scariest hit men. The Mrs. and I differ in our opinion of whether the film revolves around Costello (her view), since all the other characters revolve around him and, after all, he's played by the great Jack Nicholson, or whether DiCaprio's Billy Costigan is the main character (my opinion), since he has the most screen time and, if this story has a protagonist, Costigan is it. It's enjoyable to discuss such things, but it's quibbling. ""The Departed"" has so many well-drawn characters breathed to life by stellar actors in brilliant performances that it could easily populate two *good* films!<br /><br />Vera Farmiga was previously unknown to me, but she delivers in the only major female role as a police psychiatrist who graduated from Harvard, but takes the presumably lower-paying position because she wants to serve her community while she also helps her patients. In one of the trickiest roles of the film she becomes romantically attracted to both ""moles"", not knowing the ""true identity"" of either until the climax of the film. Her steely determination after she discovers that Matt Damon is the police department ""rat"" reminds me of Alida Valli's famous performance in ""The Third Man"" and her final scene in this movie (walking away from a funeral in a cemetery towards the camera in a single shot, completely ignoring the man who thinks he has romantic possibilities with her) is an obvious homage by Scorsese to Carol Reed's film classic.<br /><br />Ray Winstone (as Costello's right-hand man, ""Frenchie"") and Alec Baldwin (as the over-matched police detective who is trying to bring together the various machinations of the Boston detectives and undercover mob infiltrators) lead the next tier of supporting performances. It's just another sign of the overall quality of Mr. Scorsese's picture that actors who would ""star"" in other films take on roles that in other films would be fleshed out by unknowns.<br /><br />The plotting and timing are relentless.  There are a half dozen scenes with more edge-of-your-seat white-knuckle tension than a hundred chainsaw and machete wielding madmen movies combined. DiCaprio's performance brings home the fear that the character must have constantly been feeling.  If discovered, he would certainly be killed by Costello's mobsters in a way that would serve as an example. The film ends, I think, as it must, and it's fair to say it's a Noir ending and not a ""Hollywood"" ending. Over the weeks leading up to this year's Academy Awards this film will be praised more than the last 25 films nominated for ""Best Picture"" combined. All the praise and hoopla will make ""The Departed"" and it's various investors a lot of money. This makes me wonder - if great films like this are profitable, why bother with the other 99% of brainless dreck that shows up at my local cineplex every week? Just wondering."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	However the Amazon Dealer did not have it in Stock and my Money was refunded. I purchased ot from Towerfilms  at a competitive price. It was a really great movie with more twists and turns than a jigsaw puzzle.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	After having watched the mini-series on HBO I was thrilled to see that it went to DVD. I thought it was a very thought-provoking, conversation-starting series. It was something that I haven't done since ROOTS was on TV all those years ago. It had been a long time since any mini-series had drawn me to be disappointed about missing an episode. Thanks to HBO for putting it on DVD. It gives a side of John Adams that no one ever really knew about; about how he got involved in the Revolution and how he felt about public service.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"I enjoyed Sin City, but I didn't think it was a ""great"" movie. Yes, the visual style was really innovative. And the dialog was often funny, in a Mickey Spillane kind of way. Mickey Rourke is the standout among the cast.  And I really loved the music. Great, moody jazz!  But the storylines were muddled and the characters were beyond stereotypes. And it didn't really need to be two hours long. So overall, I'll give it a rating of 4 stars."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This series is truly amazing for any person who loves vampires from the present, past or futuristic. It has GREAT quality and a fantastic price. You have to get this series on blu-ray it's the only way to truly enjoy it.
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	Not my favorite Harry Potter movie and is definitely NOT for young children. Dark theme with very few light moments. Is there any reason why the final book couldn't be covered in one movie? I anticipated greatness but feel extremely disappointed eventhough I read the book. Did the 48 hour rental bit and thankful I waited to see it. If I'd seen it in a theater, I'd want a refund. Gave it 2 stars(1.5 for actors and .5 for movie) because I've become a fan of some of the actors and not because it's a good movie. The cast did a great job with the poor script they were given. If a 1.5 star was available, that would be my rating. I'll watch the final one only after it's video release. Hoping it's better than this one.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	"I watched the 1st disc and enjoyed it even though there were glaring differences from the book, went on to the 2nd disc and even proceeded to the 3rd disc.  After the last episode on the 3rd disc, I've decided I'm done with the DVD's and will just read the books.  They are so much better and they are after all the ""Sookie Stackhouse"" novels and not the ""Jason Stackhouse"" novels!  The differences from the book and the DVD just kept increasing to the point that I no longer wanted to watch.  Sookie is smart and pretty in the book, in the movie she is the cliche' of a pretty, dumb, southern blonde.  In the end my final thoughts were sympathy for Charlaine Harris and what they did to her novels."
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	"Two guys played by Matt Damon (Sullivan) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Costigan) embark on mirror-image spy careers. One is a mobster pretending to be a cop; the other is a cop pretending to be a mobster. Since the actors look annoyingly similar to me, I had trouble at first sorting things out.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson (Costello) plays basically the same dirty-minded old grouch in every movie nowadays, so he at least was no puzzle (though he did show something new in this movie, come to think of it). Same thing with Martin Sheen (Queenan), who channeled ""West Wing's"" Josiah Bartlett for this movie. Maybe recycling characters saves rehearsal time? Mark Wahlberg played a nasty, sarcastic, snarky guy named Dignam who was in almost every scene with Martin Sheen, maybe to cancel out all that Josiah Bartlett niceness. He did everything but perch on Queenan's left shoulder wearing horns and a pitchfork.<br /><br />To keep the female viewer's interest, there was a ""love triangle"" aspect with a ditzy female therapist who fell for both Sullivan and Costigan. Maybe she couldn't tell them apart any better than I could. A good twenty minutes could've been shaved off the movie if only she'd been able to beg, borrow or steal a clue in the romance department. Both of these guys were Bad Choices. Didn't she learn anything in therapist school?<br /><br />I didn't like any of the characters enough to care what happened to them, and was thus bored for most of the movie. I nearly gave myself tennis elbow from checking my watch.<br /><br />So now I wonder why so many people gave this 5 stars. Was it the shock value? Well, there was a lot of skull cracking and blood spattering. Haven't we seen enough of that yet? Lots of foul language, but they're going to have to get truly creative to shock people with that anymore. There was one truly revolting glimpse of Costello in a porn theater that fell squarely into the ""shocking"" department, I guess. No, I think what really makes this a work of genius is its message: There's not much difference between good and evil anyway, and life is short. Better get while the gettin's good.<br /><br />That's such an important message to hammer home to people nowadays, especially young people. Through the magic of DVDs, every teenager can watch this movie over and over again until that life philosophy is burned into his psyche. And they will. Thank you, Martin Scorsese!"
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	I bought the SINGLE DISC EDITION, this is my 3rd purchase from amazon. The movie is amazing, waited 2 weeks and a couple of days but was worth it. The picture in the front cover is great, the back of the case is not as cool the 2 disc edition but its ok. Now, there is a small portion of plastic removed from the side of the case( not the one where you open the case), it looked like someone bit that portion of plastic off. Im going to buy the new INCREDIBLE HULK dvd, so please AMAZON, be more careful with my next dvd. Anyway, trailers of the new Hulk, deleted scenes, NEW startrek trailer, so single disc is great if you dont want to spend more cash for the extra disc. I dont think anyone appreciates if their dvds came in damaged cases. The front and the back pictures are safe. Just that portion on the side. EXCELLENT MOVIE.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Got the video on time, in great condition. Love the movie and I am a very satisfied!!!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I am nutty for this show. I can't remember being this crazy about a show in years. I've been hooked since the first episode. Then read all the books in 2 weeks. I watch the reruns everynight. I think I have been glamoured. I can't believe I had never heard of Stephen Moyer before. Reminds me of a southern Mr. Darcy. Anna Paquin is adorable.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	I have to admit at first I only wanted to see this movie because Theron was there, she always does a great job with her characters and her portrayal of the evil queen did not dissapoint. Her acting was excellent and her Evil Queen is the best rendition I have seen so far. Chris did a really good job with the Huntsman and was a very relatable character which is why I understand their reasoning to continue the franchise expanding his character. I did not expect anything from Stewart as Im not a fan of her performances in the past however, I was surprised that at times she actually did show emotion in some scenes (she actually smiled here an there, I attribute that to her imagining Chris in his Thor costume while in scene). The story is quite interesting, there were some unnecessary characters in play that really did not add much value to the movie, Im speaking of Sam Clafin(trying to keep it spoiler free so Im being as vague as possible).<br /><br />Overall it is a good movie, it can be kind of long so you want to make sure you are up for a longer movie before you sit by it but it was very fun to me even with Stewart and Clafin playing some of the major roles. Parent warning, the Theron does a really good evil witch (as I already mentioned) which might be too scary for younger audiences.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	Could not even finish watching this movie. I knew it was going to have some things that I would find a tad bit nasty, but to make me close to being on the verge of throwing up!!!!
B0006989TE	1.0	b	story of a commune who are afraid to go into the woods because creatures are skinning all of their animals.i won't go into any further detail because it's just too ridiculous to waste much more of my time on this sorry excuse for a movie.what's most shocking about it is how so much good talent is wasted here.for the hour and 40 minutes you wait for something interesting to happen and nothing really does.one thing suprised me in the film but than it turns into just your usual hollywood cliche which carries itself throughout the movie.yes shamalyan did a good job with the sixth sense but don't let him fool you in thinking that he's a great director.this is one of the worst films in recent memory and all i can say is don't waste your money on this turkey.if you're thinking it's going to be scary,it's not,as it is more of a drama than anything.just pure crap!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I have been looking forward to this movie since I first heard about it 1 1/2 yrs before it came out. Unfortunately, I had a baby just as it was released and didn't get to see it until now. I bought it for my now 4yr old and we love to sit and watch it together on a Sunday afternoon. He loves it so much, we had his bedroom decorated with all 'Cars' stuff.<br /><br />Pixar movies are only getting better and better.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	Now, I am not a Harry Potter fan at all. I went to this movie because my fianc&eacute;e wanted to but thats not to say that this movie was not good. In fact it was great, from a movie stand point. No problems to speak of the CGI was well done and they do a great job of pulling you into this world. The acting in these movies has gotten a lot better. Over all I was entertained, which is the goal of the movie. I think that this movie series has come a long way and is getting better with each one.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"This reboot of the popular fairy tale is no Walt Disney kiddie movie.  ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a dark and often frightening reimagining of the legend, in which a young Snow White is locked up by her evil stepmother Ravenna after she murders the king and usurps the throne.  The beautiful Queen (a powerfully effective Charlize Theron) sustains herself by absorbing the youth of other women, instantly aging them, while the entire kingdom takes on a deathly pallor.  A now-grown Snow White (Kirsten Stewart) clings to her faith in a filthy, freezing and lonely tower cell.<br /><br />Magic is a key element in this movie, whether the explicit evil of Queen Ravenna or the subtle good exercised by Snow White.  Snow White's escape from the tower (and an attempted rape) is aided by some of that magic, as is her survival in the dark forest where she flees.  The Huntsman sent to track her down (a stalwart Chris Hemsworth) ends up an uncertain ally.  Snow White will face a terrifying journey, battling monsters and the Queen's pursuing henchmen, before ending up in an enchanted part of the forest where she comes to understand her powers.  She will rally her father's remaining loyal subjects for a final and very dramatic confrontation with the Queen.<br /><br />""Snow White"" ends up being an entertaining movie.  It tries to portray the leads as rounded characters, even giving the evil Queen enough backstory so that we at least may understand her single-minded pursuit of beauty and power.  The special effects are good to excellent, as is the location shooting around Britain and Ireland.  The supporting cast does its part, with lots of solid British actors hidden under beards and suits of armor.  Kirsten Stewart is nothing if not game in the lead role, although she does not have the acting range at this point to hold her own against Charlize Theron, who cleanly steals the movie.  Highly recommended as good fun, but not for the kids."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Super funny. Watch out for some language. Really shows what Jeff Dunham can do. Also has great outtakes and additional material.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Great DVD with a deap message!! And also very helpdul, if you are in trouuble in your marriage. There's a way out!!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Decided to try instant video to see how it was on k fire. Since I love Harry Potted and hadn't seen this one awhile, tried it out and was pleasantly surprised. The quality was good,  but amazon should discount for k fire as it is one person watching, not like on a Tv with maybe lots of people.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is for those who have already made the decision to buy Insanity, but are now wondering if this was a bad idea.  When I started, I was in moderate shape, and lacking in cardiovascular fitness.  I ran at most a couple of miles a week and scattered a few hours of free weights in between, focusing mostly on the upper body.  Sweat was not a part of my weightlifting routine, but it soaks me during Insanity from the warm-up to the cool down.  I love Insanity despite the extreme difficulty and occasional sick feeling.<br /><br />In the beginning:<br />When I started this, the fit test was hard, the warmups were hard, and I had trouble holding the stretches because my muscles wanted to give up.  I could not make it through the warm up without taking unscheduled breaks for at least the first two workouts.  When I hit the pure cardio workout, the air turned blue from the words uttered under my breath.  I think I spent about half of the fifteen minute pure cardio workout catching my breath.  No kidding.  This program made me realize how much I had been dodging cardio workouts: for about 30 years.<br /><br />The first two workouts after the fit test made me feel like vomiting.  I worried that I would have acid reflux problems for 60 days.  Thankfully, that is not the case.  The cardio recovery was a welcome break and lifted my spirits.  Have I mentioned how sore I was for the first five days?  Walking around like I just had a double knee replacement surgery.  Even though it was grueling, I always looked forward to the next workout.  In fact, I usually felt pretty awesome a few hours after each workout.<br /><br />Second week:<br />By the beginning of the second week, I was pretty much finished with muscle soreness, at least the kind that made me walk around like I had a groin injury.  Also, I could get through the warm ups without stopping.  However, if I did the warm ups at Shaun's pace, I usually paid for it in the actual workout.  Halfway through week two, I could get through the plyometric warm up and just about half way through the actual workout without taking an unscheduled break.  There was no way I could do that during week one.  At this point, I really began to enjoy the stretching routines.  They felt like a break, though I still had sweat dribbling off my nose.  As I became more comfortable, my form improved.  Although I still feel like puking after some workouts, nothing like the heartburn I had in the beginning.  I still take lots of breaks, but I know I can get deeper and deeper in to each workout.  I feel myself improving, and rapidly.  Yet, the improvement is not the sudden appearance of six pack abs and the loss of 20 pounds.  It's visible in strength, balance, and endurance.  I know if I continue, I will also start to see it on my body too.  Be patient.<br /><br />Week three:<br />Nearing the end of week three, those thirty second breaks are enough to push through many sets now.  My sense is that by the end of the first 30 days, I will just be able to make it through one of the workouts without significant unscheduled breaks.  Right before the program becomes incredibly more demanding.  At the same time that I make these strides, I think I am approaching a plateau.  The horrendous schedule in the second half of Insanity is the logical response to that plateau, I guess.  I still fear that last month.<br /><br />The rest of the truth:<br />The glamour and novelty of the program has started to wear off, and the workouts-especially the warmups--can seem tedious over time.  The second half changeup will help keep it interesting, and I still feel great after each round of punishment.  Progress is evident as I get further and further into each workout without stopping prematurely.  Keeping the motivation is key, and part of that is sticking to the schedule every day.<br /><br />Some tips.  If you are like me, move a lot during the rest of your day during that first week of Insanity.  It will help you get through the muscle soreness.  Drink plenty of water before the workout, but do it an hour before hand so you don't wind up water logged.  I also find that waiting at least two hours after a meal reduces heartburn.  Ideally, wear shoes with good lateral support.  Running shoes don't provide all that much support for the constant side to side jumping.  Most importantly, schedule a time for the workout and commit to it.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br />The next 30 days.  I liked the second set of workouts more than I thought I would, and the extra set was not the big deal that I made it out to be.  By the time those one-hour workouts come around, you are in mighty fine shape.  The exercises are more complex, which made the time seem to pass faster.  And the warm-up is mercifully better.  But I have a confession.  I pulled a muscle in my back/neck just as I got into that first week of really Insane.  It was that really irritating kind of strain that prevents you from moving your head from side to side.  Well, I gave up Insanity for about a week to recover from it (during the holidays of course) and I never got all the way back in.  I'm still Insanely more fit than I was, but I didn't earn the Boy Scout badge for six pack abs.  After a round of P90X, I'll try again this spring.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"I grew up in a very conservative Christian home.  I remember hearing about how the world is slipping down a moral slope.  With prayer in school gone and the lie of ""separation of church and state"" permeating our society.  We as American's have lost those Judeo-Christian ideals that the founding fathers put in place.  Hence we were a fallen nation, and that's why there are so many problems in this Country.<br /><br />While I'm not asking anyone whose reading this to embrace these ideas, they permeate M. Knight Shyamalan's new film ""The Village.""  An intriguing motion picture that asks and yet never quite answers the questions many American's are asking in this post 9/11, postmodern, and enlightened period.<br /><br />THE VILLAGE is a quaint little place far from the bustling ""towns"" of evil and greed.  It's a 19-century prairie town, and a utopia where decent people live out their lives in peace and modest prosperity.  Money is not and issue, for the people of THE VILLAGE have no need of it.  They all speak and act like Quakers, and hold close to traditional family values.<br /><br />Of course THE VILLAGE has its own local government.  It is ruled by board of elders, who are strict but fair.  There seems to be only one rule, ""Stay Out of Covington Forrest.""<br /><br />You see the forest is the only problem with the Village. It's full of monsters.  As long as the people stay out of the wood The Monsters leave them alone. The other problem is that The Village needs some basic drugs to save its people.  As the film opens we see the casket of a young boy who died because he did not have simple medicine's to keep him alive.  It's a scary existence but there is peace, so it might just be a trade off? Or is it?<br /><br />THE VILLAGE is the type of movie I personally love.  It is a film about subtext.  But what gives the film its spark is the fact that it doesn't play its message at you. But you only realize this if you give it some time and patience.  If you overlook its flaws, what you'll find is a movie that speaks to any audience.  Without being preachy and overwrought.<br /><br />It plays with some of the things we as American's have gotten used to in these dark times.  The color terror alert systems, false terror alarms, and presents people like you and me, people who want to go about their days without having to worry about the darkness hiding in the woods.  THE VILLAGE is a typical suburban town, if it was transplanted onto the prairie.<br /><br />I loved the scene with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix, GLADIATOR) and Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard, The Grinch) as they sit on the porch in the middle of the night and preach their love to each other.  The scene is alive with energy and light.  Shyamalan frames the shot so close up, you feel like your part of the action, and the actors turn the stilted Quaker like dialogue on its head.<br /><br />Howard is just phenomenal.  She fills her character with color.  The other actors around her seem weighed down by the stilted dialogue, which I'll admit takes some getting used to.  Howard enchants from the very first frame and commands the audience's eyes.  Like a young Holly Hunter mixed with Julia Roberts, Bryce Howard has the potential to be the next big thing. Watch out pop a couple years from now we could have another Oscar winner in the family.<br /><br />The other bright spot in the film is Adrien Brody (The Pianist) he portrays Noah the town retard.  Man did he have a good time.  There is energy in his portrayal that just gushes with enthusiasm.  It looks like he's having a ball.  I'll admit there was one moment I thought he was laying it on a little too much.  But I'll forgive him that small moment cause he's just dead on the rest of the time.<br /><br />At its heart THE VILLAGE is social commentary for both sides of an argument.  For some they will look at these characters and think them pathetic.  Why give up your freedom for safety?  Why allow the government to fuel your fears?  But other will look at these characters and say ""isn't it great that these people got away from the horror of this world? Isn't it wonderful that they created a utopia?  I wish I lived in The Village, free from all the evil influences of the world at large.""<br /><br />As for the patented surprise ending, it works... sort of.  If you give the movie its due you'll be satisfied.  I smelled it from a mile away and still took a lot away from the movie.  If you don't buy the premise you'll be let down and hate the movie.  But that's okay.  Great movies don't have to be universally loved, as long as you don't leave the theater indifferent the movie will have an effect on you.  It will keep you talking and that's a good thing.<br /><br />**** Out of 5"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"Cars is a movie you can watch over and over. It is so unique and it is so easy to ""fall in love"" with the characters. My all time favorite I think is Mater.<br /><br />You AND your children will love it."

B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Love, love, love it! the DVDs were in perfect condition! Needless to say I'm now hooked on True Blood!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I first want to say that I am an overweight, 24 year old female and this video is truly insane.  I have been doing this video for a short time, but I can say that it feels great.  I have purchased a number of videos trying to get the weight off that came on from stress, eating, and more stress, and Insanity is the only one that makes me want to keep going and provides results.<br /><br />Shaun T makes working out hard, but rewarding.  I was apprehensive about beginning this workout because many people were saying you needed to be fit and in shape to do it...WORNG!  I do agree that you need to be somewhat active to get going.  This Fit Test will have you drenching in sweat.  With each workout, you will find yourself doing better and better.  I had to modify many things at first, but I now see that I can make my jumps higher and endure longer.<br /><br />A bonus for me is when I think it's too hard, I look at Shaun T's team and see them taking a break, and know that if they can take a break and they are fit, I can.  And sometimes they are breaking and I am still going, and that makes me feel great.<br /><br />Ladies, I love my hair done, my nails painted and manicured, wearing pink, and skirts and sandals.. so I am as girly as they come.  If I can do this, so can you.  Worry about your hair the hour after you've finished.  I keep going and know that my hair is not as important as my health.  Don't be afraid.<br /><br />After trying many things, I found this DVD to make you want to keep going.  I find me telling myself that it is only 60 days.  On mornings I don't want to get up, I think, come on it's just 45 minutes and the rest of your life. Results are bound to come if you committ.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Not a review but a question. What exactly is the difference between this BR and the other Iron Man BR that's no longer available? Thanks.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This show is so much fun and it keeps you on your toes.  If you have read the books don't be surprised if it doesn't exactly follow the first book faithfully.  I actual enjoy this because I am never sure what will happen.  If you want something a little more adult than Twilight than you should watch this.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	Bought this for my son (18).  He thoroughly enjoyed the action and technology.  I found the scenery to be a bit dark.  Overall, a pretty good movie for the price.

B0006989TE	4.0	b	While M. Night's has maybe backed himself into a corner with the audience expecting to be shocked at some point, this is nevertheless ranks right up there with The Sixth Sense for me.  The shocker bit isn't that much of a shocker, but that is unimportant.  The crux of this movie is the love story between the two characters, played by Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard.  That is the real story - how far one would go for a beloved.  Ms. Howard is a find - one of the most unaffected actresses of her generation to grace the screen.  Don't watch this movie for the twist.  Watch it for the love story.  It's a pleasant surprise.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	True Kristen stewart wasn't the best in this movie and yeah yeah movie was dark but what were you expecting the dwarfs and snow white to start singing and running around like complete idiots or what? Come on ppl we all know you guys are not giving this movie good reviews because of kristen stewart you played snow white. Overall it was a good movie good plot not the best cast but it was still a good movie.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie was very real.  Every couple should see this and apply the principles.  It will make you want to treat your spouse better.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	While it wasn't as good as the first one, it was so incredibly funny. I love Jeff Dunham and Peanut. Switching out the old manager for the dead terrorist was a great idea, but I'm not so sure about the super hero.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I love this mini-series-- it's very well done and faithful to the book by David McCullough.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Polar Express is one of my kid's favorite movies.  I was grateful to find it new at such a great price.

B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	This one is a real in and out of dirty cops and undercover cops<br />fighting it out in a poker hand, hide and seek<br />with death as the hole card.<br />The acting and script are the best I have seen of this sort<br />and there have been a whole lot of these dirty cop movies.<br />The gangsters are winning as this movie starts.<br />The inside man is a young fellow who is ambitious for higher things.<br />The undercover cop should have thought twice before taking the assignment...<br />I really enjoyed the movie, but not the harsh ending.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	It is getting to the point where there are more good animated movies being made then live action movies. This is another great animated film. The DVD is an excellent transfer and a must have for family viewing.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	This is a film that grows on you.  I have watched it several times.  It gets better with each viewing.  The quality of the transfer is excellent.  The price was too good to turn down.  If you've never seen this film, you're in for a tension filled treat.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I found this to be an excellent action/adventure/fantasy movie.  This version of the classic Snow White tale was well done with fantastic special effects, a great story line, and wonderful acting.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that I found the ending to be somewhat of a letdown, albeit the logical place to end the story.  The ending just lacked the vibrancy of the rest of the film.
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	"So at first, after I watched the first few episodes, I thought it was a bit like watching a train wreck with lots of sex. The characters are often insanely dumb, to the point where you slap your forehead and think ""You idiot!"". The thing is, it's realistic. People do act this way. People do stupid stuff all the time. They lie, they do drugs despite knowing it's dumb, they hook up with the wrong person and go along with someone else's lead and get into trouble and yes, it's moronic, but it happens every single day. This time it;s just happening on TV with hot people and vampires. These folks aren't acting out some Dracula wannabe plot - it's every possible bad choice and malicious intent and poor desperate act you've ever heard of, on screen, with good skin and a perky figure. It's a beautiful disaster.<br /><br />By the time I'd finished the series, I'd come to the realization that the writers are pure genius. It takes some serious skills to present this level of idiocy accurately and in a fashion that people will want to watch. It's a perfect black comedy, helped by that fact that most of the actors are playing it like it's a drama, and the vampire characters are playing it like it's a horror. It's not doing anything to help combat the stereotype that ""southerners are morons"", but it's certainly entertaining.<br /><br />Yes, I'll watch the second season. You don't see this quality writing every day on TV, that's for certain."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This film is one of the most interesting ones I've seen on food production in the US.  There are so many complex issues this film covered.  It really changes how I look at food.  I showed it to my high school students and they were so interested.  I think everyone in the US should see it.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Wow, anything more dishonest I've never seen. I thought at some point that Ben Stein was an intelligent fellow, but after seeing him fall for this Intelligent Design creationism garbage I think he's an utter dolt. The movie is sheer propaganda for the Discovery Institute and their nutty, ignorant ideas; nothing else. The misquoting of Charles Darwin's words is shameful, and the implied link between evolution and Nazism has to be one of the most vile and revolting things ever suggested. That Hitler thought he was doing god's work by killing jews is, of course, never mentioned.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	This movie is incredibly rushed through and out of place. Before watching the movie I had already heard that it was crap but ended with a good twist which apparently kind of made up for the rest of the movie. The acting was crappy all the way through the movie (especially Ron Howards daughter she has to be disposed of from an acting carreer), and you will shorely notice a ton of mistakes throughout the movie as I did which is quite dissapointing for Shyamalan regarding his ability to release some really good titles such as 'The sixth sense' and 'signs'.<br /><br />The worst part i have seen joaquin play in history i think the movie could have knocked him down a few spots in rank. I can see that the movie has been built so you have no idea of the twist that is about to come. After a crappy lead up i they finally got to the twist which was really crap and i thought was quite predictable .<br /><br />I honestly don't know how this movie could possibly get 5 stars but i suggest you watch it and report your own thoughts, i hope that he does a much better job on his next movie.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	Not just another super-hero. The actors lift this and make it fly. As with all the great comicbook movies, it's not the fx, it's the heart. This is a fun one.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Robert Downey Jr.'s best movie EVER!!!!<br /><br />Action packed, almost a little to much love story but not to much.<br /><br />Very thing you would want in a ""super hero"" movie<br /><br />""I AM IRON MAN"""
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"Though the actors in this film may not totally be Hollywood quality, that is one of the reasons this movie works!  Fireproof is real, down-to-earth, and even biographical for many couple's marital problems.  Kirk Cameron gives an amazing performance portraying a man who decides to love his wife unconditionally, after accepting Christ as his personal Savior.  What an amazing testimony for anyone, but especially couples who are looking for a successful marriage.  This DVD is a must have for couples seeking a marriage ""made in heaven."""
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"I bought this as a gift for a family with small children. I know it has been a favorite for many families. Since I like to follow the races myself, I chose to watch it too. Besides being an enjoyable movie on the surface, it's a movie with a message that can teach the value of teamwork vs. trying to go it alone--something all of us need to learn while we are young. It's the kind of movie that deserves repeated watching.<br /><br />I have read a number of books on leadership this year. I'll just mention one that speaks about teamwork, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002N6VVFM"">The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Unabridged on 5 CDs [5 Dysfunctions</a>], a ""leadership fable"" that focuses on the characteristics directly opposed to the building blocks which the author claims are essential for teamwork to develop. These five dysfunctions are absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results.<br /><br />You can see some of this at work in this movie. I believe you can see also the reversal of some form of these at work as the movie progresses. You see that it takes the development of interpersonal relationships and personal goals to overcome obstacles that are necessary to make teams work--to make us team players. These are not insignificant qualities for our children to acquire. We all want them to be successful. These are not trivialized by successful persons. A great plus is: it's all presented in an understandable format within the context of something that is simply good entertainment enjoyed by many of us.<br /><br />Very enjoyable and instructional!"
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	I enjoyed No Country For Old Men, it was an entertaining and compelling film, but it was flawed at the same time. So, I would have to disagree with Roger Ebert's proclamation that this film is flawless. This film has a lot to offer to people who have a dedicated taste in movies and who don't get bored easily.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: A drug deal in Texas goes sour, drug dealers end up dead. Then a man discovers the crime scene, and takes some things he shouldn't have (Some guns and $2 million in drug money). After he takes this money he sets off a deadly game of kill-or-be-killed when the killer comes back for the money and discovers it's gone. He hunts the man who took the money and won't let up, and even kills anyone who gets in his way to finding this man.<br />MUSIC: There is no music, it's like watching an Albert Hitchcock film. This is one of the reasons I find the movie to be flawed is the complete absence of music.<br />ACTION: This film can be suspenseful, bloody, and just downright violent. There are quite of few shooting scenes as well, which adds to great action.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: Usually this film is quite entertaining, but sometimes the dialogue goes on for toooo long (The coin toss scene is the biggest one). This film has its share of satisfying, suspenseful, and surprising moments of violence, but then I can't help but get pissed at the terrible ending (You don't end a movie like that, dammit!). You will enjoy this film if you have fairly decent taste in movies, but be warned of the long dialogue and bad ending.<br />OVERALL: If you're not sure about it, rent it first. This film caters to more specific tastes in movies, so be warned.<br />THE GOOD: Good bloody action, suspenseful scenes, and quite a few surprising moments.<br />THE BAD: Awful ending, no music.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I recomended this movie and the book all peoople that are in some trouble (personal)with others. It's a good instrument to put in practice all you need to saved a relationship.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Thank you for the DVD.  I did receive it on time but had a hard time getting to send a feed back.  I like the movie and I would order from you again.  Thank yuu again.
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	"I'm not sure that any good series on the supernatural has ever tried as hard to be simply good fun.  It isn't the masterpiece that BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was, but I don't think Alan Ball set his sights that high.  While Joss Whedon strove in BUFFY to create an icon and redefine television narrative, Ball just seems to want to tell a compelling story filled with memorable moments.<br /><br />TRUE BLOOD is, of course, based on the series of novels written by Arkansas writer Charlaine Harris.  The series was originally known as the Southern Vampire Mysteries, but has since come to be better known as The Sookie Stackhouse novels.  The premise is that a Japanese corporation has successfully created artificial blood, a product so like the real thing that vampires, previously relegated to feeding off humans in the dark, come ""out of the coffin"" and into society, intent on living off the new fake blood.  The series' title comes from the name of the artificial blood marketed and sold in stores.  The television series wisely does not try to hew too closely to the novels, though for the most part Sookie's story does.  And the way things turn at the end of the season, it is clear that Season Two (the show was renewed very early in the season) is going to pick up with the second novel in the series, though the action most likely will be in Bon Temps and not in Dallas (the second novel is entitled LIVING DEAD IN DALLAS).<br /><br />The major difference between the novels and the TV series is that while the novels focus almost entirely on Sookie, the series has elevated a number of secondary characters and padded out their story.  The focus on Sookie in the books is inevitable given that she is the narrator.  But since few shows attempt to tell a story primarily from one character's point of view (an exception is Season One of VERONICA MARS, in which the title character features in very nearly every scene), elevating several characters was a necessity.  Tara is a very minor character in the books (and white to boot), but on the show she is black and one of the most important characters.  Sookie's brother Jason is a moderately important character in the books, but definitely not as central as Bill, Eric, or Sam.  Tara was promoted on the show partly to balance out the show in terms of race and gender.  I'm not quite sure why Jason was made more important.  The story arcs that are given to these characters are not always successful, but they do give the show some diversity.  Lafayette, Tara's flamboyantly gay cousin and short order cook at Merlotte's, the tavern where Sookie is a barmaid, likewise is a major character on the TV series, but barely makes an appearance in the novels.<br /><br />I'm not always comfortable with the additions the show makes to the story and they usually are the weakest part of the show.  For instance, the long story of Tara's mother and her demon possession is an addition that I feel clutters the show, even as it raises the question of why Tara herself struggles with relationships.  The character of Amy, who is weirdly involved with Jason in the latter half of the season, sits on the rest of the story like a weird, disconnected appendage.  In fact, the entire obsession with V (or vampire blood, which is taken like a drug) is unique to the show and not the books, I think to the show's detriment.  Terry Bellefleur is a slightly more important character in the series, and about 20-30 years younger (and played by Todd Lowe, who played Zack, Lane's band mate/boyfriend/husband in THE GILMORE GIRLS), and a veteran of the Gulf War instead of the Vietnam War.  I don't expect for a show to be especially true to its source material.  I don't look for a scene-by-scene recreation.  But I do think that the additions show actually add something of value to the story.  All in all, I do not think the completely original aspects improved the overall story.<br /><br />There is a lot of controversy on boards where fans of the books linger about Anna Paquin.  Physically she isn't quite like how Sookie is described in the books, where she is far curvier and extremely busty.  I personally love Anna Paquin's performance.  She has a haunted, hunted look that someone who has had to struggle for years of hearing the thoughts of others might have.  She does very much seem to embody ""Crazy Sookie,"" as she is known to everyone in Bon Temps.  I also like all the actors who played the three other major characters from the books, Stephen Moyer as Bill, Alexander Skarsgaard as Eric (who will, given his stature as an actor and the precedent of the books, become a more important character in Season Two -- and let me just add, could anyone have been found more perfect to play Eric?), and Sam Trammell as Sam Merlotte.  My favorite performer to play a major role on the show but a minor one in the books is Nelsan Ellis, who also had a recurring role on the sadly short-lived THE INSIDE and was on an excellent episode of VERONICA MARS, and who on TRUE BLOOD plays Lafayette.  Though I have to add that he is s completely unbelievable character.  I've lived three years in a town not terribly distinct from Bon Temps and I can assert that you simply will not find many if any openly gay people and definitely not one a flamboyant one.<br /><br />All in all I really enjoyed the series TRUE BLOOD, though on the one hand I prefer the books (and I strongly recommend anyone who loves TRUE BLOOD to give the books a try, though I also warn them that the show does seem to be following to a greater or lesser degree the books -- Season Two is already set up to follow many of the second novel's storylines) and on the other I prefer Alan Ball's earlier show SIX FEET UNDER.  Still, it is a good, fun show.<br /><br />And can I just add that this show has my all time favorite opening credits.  It is filled with one astonishing image after another, from a coiled water moccasin to a Holy Ghost inspired preacher doing a 180 jump in church to lasciviously dancing strippers, all to a wonderfully appropriate song by country performer Jace Everett entitled ""Bad Things."""
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	It's pretty amazing that the same director who cranked out stellar blockbusters now consistently produces garbage.  I'm only in my twenties, and hardly nostalgic for the good old 80's, but his most recent movies have just disappointed and this was no exception.  They are typically entertaining at first but after about an hour I find myself looking at my watch and by the end I'm just waiting for the tiring storm of computer special effects to die down.  It was bad enough that Shia Laboeuf was casted for this but the second I saw the 'surprise' appearance of Karen Allen ... well, I nearly walked out.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This DVD is awesome! Comedian is the best there is! The Bloopers are hilarious and another great quality! Definatly worth the little that you have to pay!
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	I never recieved the item that i order. This is the first time in years this has happen to me.
B00447G29S	3.0	b	The DVD works just fine.  The case was not in the best shape.  My son just loves this movie and it was a good price.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I bought this for my grandson & watched it with him...it was great!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	LOVE LOVE LOVE this workout!<br />It is rightful named as it is can be insane especially Pure Cardio so you should be in good physical condition before starting this. But after I am done, I feel like I got a really good workout. Here is how it works: there are two levels - each level is 1 month long. The first level, the workouts are between 30-40 mins and you will definitely break a sweat. One day one, there is a Fitness Test which you take again after two weeks to assess your improvement. This test is challenging but it is fun to see how much improvement is made after just two weeks. I have not got to level 2 yet.<br /><br />After doing this program for two weeks, my thighs are mostly muscle, my arms are thinner and I just feel stronger. Sean T is a great motivator. He pushes you but doesn't get in your face and get nasty like some (i.e. Jillian Michaels.) This attitude has helped me stay motivated while looking forward to the workout. Also, he does a lot of the workout with you and does not rely on his backup to do most of the workout while he gives instruction. I also love the diversity. Each day is a new program so you are not doing the same workout over and over again. Sean T has found moves that are challenging and get results quick while at the same time are not overly complicated that it takes awhile to figure out or leaves me injured. I love this program and can't wait to take it to the next level.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"""Cars"" is the inventive, creative, and entertaining animated film of the year.  Plugging into America's love with the automobile the producers offer a timeless tale that is destined to become a cult classic.  This action packed show speaks volumes through the roar, rumble, romance and racing of hotrods, race cars, and sweet rides.<br /><br />The characters' witty names reflect their personalities and help with screen play motion:  ""Lightening McQueen"" (Bullitt and the Cooler King would've driven this racer), ""The King"" (Petty's Superbird always grabs my attention!), ""Tow Mater"", etc.  This movie is brilliant and funny.  Your entire family will enjoy this DVD.  Your little ones will, especially, like it.<br /><br />I always prefer the wide screen version, but have also watched a friend's full screen ""Cars"".  Both are great.  If you want good clean fun, with a poignant moral at the end (honor, loyalty, and friendship are more important than winning, fame, and money!) then ""Cars"" is the fun-flick for you.  Race down your DVD soon!<br /><br />Happy Thanksgiving!"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I was searching for an alternative to showing SuperSize Me in my anatomy and physiology class (grades 11-12) for the nutrition unit.  Most high school students at my school had seen SuperSize Me in their health class.  Food Inc should be carefully previewed prior to showing in your class.  There are a few scenes that you may want to skip if you have sensitive/younger students in your class.  On the other hand, showing the entire film can facilitate discussion about the food industry.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	On disc 1 and 2 I could only watch the first episode on each bc there were spots on the disc that looked like it was melted
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	The movie was incredibly cut-up and lacked plot/character development. The graphics were superb, but at great cost to the film. I was incredibly disappointed at the aweful portrayal of the fifth book and will not likely watch it more than one more time. Had I not read the book, I would have not understood a single thing that was going on because the movie was just all over the place. The significance of most of the characters was not exemplified and the only thing anyone could have gotten out of it was Voldemort was evil and tricked Harry into getting a glowing sphere. There were many things missing in which the movie could benefitted more by following the book. The only part which I thought was extremely captivating was when all of Dumbledore's Army was punished with the special quill. The look on the Weasly twin's face (I think it was Fred) really captured the moment of agony and disgust.
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	With all the interest, talent, money and track record it is nothing short of a huge disappointment to me that Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull manages to irritate, bore and overkill in as much as it thrice thrilled, charmed and energized.<br />I'll only say that it seems to have fallen into the recent Star Wars trap of pumping in technology and cg effects at a constant clip, oddly at the expense of story and character. Consider that this fits more with the National Treasure, Mummy or Tomb Raider films than with the originals. Maybe I am getting old, and having recently watched the first three Indianas I was struck by this installment's excessive scope, lost humor, trying suspensions of my disbelief (a refrigerator through the air? That whole jungle chase!) and partial historical components.<br />The originals were more intimate despite having global implications, and beautifully balanced action pieces with charged, humorous, warm scenes of comraderie, romance or family.<br />Maybe this will signal the end of pushing the once successful franchise back out for another round of pub and profit (Die Hard 4, Rocky 6, Terminator 3, Alien/Predator, Rambo 4, etc.), calling into question the good fortune of a series' reputation and the essential significance of movie lovers affections for the films of their youth.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Ben Stein (and team) did a fantastic job with this documentary, Very eye opening to the lack of intelligence allowed in higher education.  It is amazing that students learn any truth.  This movie will either get you very motivated or very upset with our educational system. Hopefully it will get your brain thinking and your desire for the truth to get you researching for it, you will be better for it. Thank you Ben Stein.
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	Get the DVD just for Walter, Peanut, and jose. there are two others that are not nearly as good (which is probably why they are no longer in the act).<br /><br />there is an option for bleeped and un-bleeped which is good, and the ability to chapter-choose which puppet you want to see is priceless!<br /><br />This is one of the best comedians out there, with three of his best friends ever!
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	A successful fantasy requires more than special effects, action, dwarves, white horses, evil villains and pretty women. I felt like the director really wanted this to be comparable to Lord of the Rings.  It's so very much not.  Without a good screenplay, the remaining elements are merely window dressing.  This story was sloppy, flat, predictable, and tedious.  The dramatic pans, sweeping landscapes and musical score couldn't prop up what simply wasn't there.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"Ok so TV is bad for a three year old ? Well if it is on ALL the time maybe sure. I find that this is a good can't find a thing on to wacth HAVE to get stuff done three year old pleaser! The screams and squeels of approval tell it all. I am guaranteed a few moments to cook or pay bills or pretty much get any really pressing thing done. There is one seen that bothers me though it is when the car tries to 'out run' a train! Ok, the car makes it unharmed, still, this I HAD to explain that he(and or the car) should NEVER do that in real life! We live not too far from the REAL rail road tracks ourselves. I guess my child got the message cause the other day he was sreaming ""no don't do it"" to the car on the movie ""your gonna get sqashed!"". Over all it is a good movie to see. Funny though, I don't think he has over seen the end of it, he ussually falls asleep before it is over. Me I have to chukle, tractor tipping... please... and Frank oh boy that's just to funny..."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I never actually thought a show like this would be funny but I was really wrong.  I was laughing the whole time and now I have to watch all Jeff's other things!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This fully realized depiction of the life of John Adams was superbly acted.  The detail of the rendering of this turbulent time in American history was immaculate.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I watch movies to be entertained. This movie did that. It was well acted by all. The story was quite different than what I expected out of Snow White, but I still enjoyed it.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	I could go in to a long review of this film, however I believe short and to the point would be better. The acting as advertised is first rate. Bardem is the prototypical stone killer. No emotion, no sentiment. Tommy Lee Jones is the sherrif who knows he is in over his head and frustrated knowing he can't prevent what's coming. Brolin is fine in his role and Harrelson plays his part well. All the pieces are well crafted, but not all of the pieces are present for a complete puzzle. The movie has a very unsatisfying ending in my opinion. Way too many unanswered questions. The logic within the movie is flawed at several points - not the actors fault. The film did drag at a couple of points and as mentioned there were too many coincidental situations for my liking. I'd like to have seen this remade with a tighter script and better ending.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I am an adult and this movie makes me smile and giggle.  I love the movie.  I have watched it four times.  I am a cancer patient and this movie always picks up my spirits
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	The kids and I all watched it several times, it is that good.  We can't wait to see part 2!
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	The only thing I would change in this movie is the adult Snow White... But in general I think is worth to watch; there is a twist from the classic and it is entertaining. I wouldn't pay to watch it in the cinema, though.
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	This dvd had very funny material, thought the beginning of dvd was little slow about the airports and family life.  But the rest of the show was very funny and never loses your intrest.  My favorite will always be Walter and Jose.  So if your in the mood to laugh very loud and have an enjoyable night of laughs and unbleeped words and humor then pick this dvd up and make yourself and rest of family memebers laugh out loud.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie is one that every married couple should watch when they start out, or anytime for that matter.
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	I have never seen an actor so in over her head. Rosario was so over-the-top that it ruined the movie for me.
B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	"An interesting and funny film that asks a simple question: Why can't scientists ask a simple question without losing their jobs?<br /><br />Ben Stein & Co. travel around the country (and world) asking why it's so ""verboten"" (forbidden) to advance the theory (or even mention) that organic life might have been created deliberately rather than arising spontaneously from a mud puddle and a bolt of lightning (or whatever).  They interview many notable figures on both sides of this question (most hilariously Richard Dawkins).  And they come away with some very interesting observations.<br /><br />Most notable among their observations is that academic freedom is CLEARLY being stifled by people who have a lot to lose, credibility-wise and dollar-wise, if competing views of the world are allowed to gain any traction.  Big Science is also Big Business, as Ben points out.<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone who has a brain and is willing to use it."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Great movie about a great man and lady. Something we no longer teach in the schools since the government has taken over education. A lot of great people worked hard to give us what we have. We should stop wasteing time and stand up for what is right. We as a great country need to stop the crazy ness and get back to what our for farthers showed us. Big government is getting way to big and out of hand.<br /><br />Please show this to your family and friends.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	Special effects were good.. Charleze Theron was great! I just was not that satisfied with it.. Overall it was just an ok movie!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	The image and sound are so great that you can feeel the images coming out your HDTV...
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"Personally supervised by Quentin Tarantino, Sin City is a masterpiece of cinematography with a perfect cast and action that will put you on the edge of your seat. The movie is primarily in black and white, but only utilizes color for special emphasis (i.e. lips, blood, and the dress a woman is wearing). This original unique style of filming accompanied with a narrative voice allows the viewer to willingly suspend their suspense of disbelief and enter into the world of Sin City. Bruce Willis, who plays Hartigan, is a burnt-out cop that is pushing 60 that saves a 12 year old girl (Jessica Alba) from being raped and killed.  Mickey Rourke, who plays the character of Marv, is a near unstoppable juggernaut man with a vendetta with anyone related to his one-night stand love ""Blondie"". Elijah Wood plays a freakishly fast cannibal psychopath that slashes people with his elongated finger nails -- what an extreme character compared to Wood's Frodo from Lord of the Rings, but he pulls it off perfectly! This was perhaps the best action movie I have seen all year. It's definitely worth paying the hefty price of $8.75 too see Sin City in your local theatre. If you like badass nonstop action, great acting with an engaging plot, and a movie that sets new standards in cinematography, then Sin City is a movie that you will definitely not want to miss!"
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	I gave it 1 star because there was no option for zero. Why did Charlize ever do this stupid movie?  Terrible writing, stupid plot, fake story.

B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"Scorsese is not one of my favorites, but he's moving up.  This movie takes a long moment to get into, but once it gets going you do get emotionally invested.  Of course, I'm still wondering what was in the brown envelope Costigan gave the therapist, but whateva.  There is nothing new as far as the old adage ""you live by the sword (or gun) then you die by the sword (or gun)""  Liars are trying to find out who's lying and so on and so on.  Given how some scenes are choppy, I have a feeling the DVD is going to have a director's cut version because I think there so much of this film that was left on the cutting room floor.  By the last act when people started dropping like flies, the script lost me.  Not that I was confused, but I simply stop caring what happened.  I was like Sullivan's character when he muttered his last line. ""All right then"".  I'm in the audience muttering to the screen 'sure, why not?'  It's a good film in a long season mediocre films. Recommended."
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Twilight on steroids for Kristen !! James bitting Bella was very dynamic drama ! Well as Snow White her reactions were almost continuous in her escape through the forest to her fight with the evil Queen !! The emotional roller coaster was really screaming as she pulled me through each episode !! The burnout from retakes she must experience must be beyond belief ! Kristen sure has my vote, and what ever she gets for playing these parts she deserves and should get more !! Now I'm a total fan !!!! She is a Super Star !!!!  A mild shock set in on Snow White's second run on the Big Screen(first time on computer) the next day !! The world's most beautiful victim getting hammered right to end !! LOVE This version of Snow White !!!!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	OH MY, HAVING CARS THAT NOT ONLY ZOOM AROUND, BUT ARE IN AN AUDIENCE AND SPEAK!!! I BOUGHT IT FOR MY 3 YEAR  OLD GRANDSON & HE LOVES IT. IT'S A REAL KICK!!!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	This documentary is artistically done and makes its point well.  The point being that those in academia who question Darwinism are shunned and/or fired (when possible). Professor Gonzalez is a perfect example:  he was probably (I think totally) more qualified than the tenured staff, yet he was dismissed.  To ask where the stuff came from that made up the big bang in the first place, or the beginning of life, is apparently a big no-no.  So yes, this is worthwhile seeing. The only thing I didn't like about it is that President Reagan was included in it, making it look like all the proponents of Intelligent Design are Republican.  That's not true, and I've seen a number of complaints about this.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	The movie is superb and the Blu-ray makes it even better. Good value for money.<br />Must have in a collection if you like crime/thriller genre.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	If there's an Imax 3D theatre in your area, see Polar Express there!  The big screen, big sound and 3D make the experience awesome.  Anyone who likes the Peter Pan ride at Disney theme parks for its flight over and through London, will go bonkers for the aerial scenes in Polar Express.  The movie, as a story is good.  But for fans of animation and computer graphics, Polar Express on Imax 3D is the new state of the art.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Not only is Jeff a great ventriloquist but he's very, very funny and to think he creates and makes all these characters is just way out there. He's a natural comic. We recently watched one of his DVD's at a club campout and were all nearly in tears before he finished. Fantastic.
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	This movie will not go down as supberbly acted, but that's not the point.  This story is about ordinary people who aren't slick, perfect, or powerful.  It contrasts what a worldly marriage can be like and what can happen once Christ enters in.  If you think divorce is the only option for a struggling marriage, this movie will make you think again.  My spouse and I have a good solid marriage, but we were both a little kinder and gentler with each other after seeing the movie.  We both would recommend this to other couples and those considering marriage.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	I haven't seen a sci-fi movie that I really loved. The 3D was fantastic. I love the film, and hope for a sequel, and even more entries in the Alien/Predator universe. All in all, Prometheus is an instant classic. 5 stars, amazing film.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This movie pops in Blu-ray format. Black stay true and colors jump off the screen
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	My 5 year old is addicted to the Iron Man movies and we ordered this BD for him.  There is adult commentary that he doesn't understand but makes it more interesting for mom and dad.  Great picture quality as well.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie is wonderful -- lots of fun and oh so cute! If you enjoyed the other Disney/Pixar movies, you are sure to like this one as well!
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	Not of Disney's best but very enjoyable. I love the traditional hand drawn animation but this movie has a charm of it's own that can not be denied and you'll find your self smiling and enjoying the story.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"God this sucked. This movie was a lame duck on so many levels. The film was dissatisfying in every detail. We the audience were decieved. It promised answers and only offered questions. It implied tention and supplied boardom. The charactors were boring and pointless. I witnessed brillient scientist exibit nothing, but a lack of commen sense and go hysterical for nothing. Yelling and screaming without cause. The Engineers were nothing more than insane solders and scientist who were about developing biological weaponry which ""WE"" may have been created for as weapons, targets, ginny pigs or accidental biproducted or genetically flawed offspring created for an unknown reason or by accident of they're demise. Why did David infect Charlie just to screw us out of the results? I don't know. This movie made no sense. It did not coincide with the mythology nor did the facts from it's predacessors fit the puzzle. This film is NOT worthy of the Alien franchse nor universe. It's dull, lifeless and just dissappointing."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"I show this film to my environmental science college students. Also, the ""Food Inc."" website has instructional materials and ideas for discussion.  Just warn the students that a couple of scenes may be disturbing."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Shaun T does it again. Insanity is a great workout. I would definitely recommend this product.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	aNOTHER GREat add to our HARRY pOTTER Collection just a few more and will have them all and my daughter will get to see some of the most imaganitive movies ever
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I saw the IMax version of Polar Express last year with my grandaughter, age 9, and we couldn't stop talking about it. Recently we viewed it on DVD and it was just as wonderful. I found the film to be like viewing the illustrations in the book on a large scale. I highly recommend the film to adult as well as child, especially if you are familiar with the original book.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Saw the movie at the Imax Theater.  It had so much more to it then we expected. The ride on top of the train was as if you were on a roller coaster!  Tom Hanks was an excellent Conductor.  The Santa Claus seemed old world and wonderful.  Finally we have an answer to how Santa's Sleigh is loaded. What fun! The message of the story was perfect for this time of year.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	If you like beautiful women, good dialogue, kick-ass action sequences, and an insane depth of actors giving awsome performances than chances are you will like this movie. Sure some of the scenes are a little much, for instance Hardigan ripping off parts of the human annatomy that makes most men cringe. Being based on Frank Millers graphic novels, and by graphic I mean it in every sense of the word, you are going to see some ultra-violence, but the gore and blood are bearable due to the films color scheme, and the rest is left to ones own twisted imagination. For the people who identify Elijah Wood with the friendly hobbit from the Shire be prepared for a whole knew range of his acting ability. His haunting performance alone is 5 stars. Don't bring the jeolouse girlfriend to the movie, the women on screen demand all the attention. Enjoy.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"I have not read the books, so I am not trying to compare them, but got this set after I saw a couple of episodes on TV and wanted to see the whole season.<br /><br />Overall this is alot of fun, a good blend of the supernatural with both humor, sex and violence.  From the opening scene of the first episode when someone goes into a store to get some ""True Blood"" (an artifical blood drink for vampires) to the mystery surrounding who did what to who, it is just great and entertaining.<br /><br />Sometimes the acting has moments that do not hold up, but they are limited and often I think is due to the actors staying in their roles.<br /><br />Sookie is actually more ""deep"" than some people have mentioned, she just does it in a low key matter of fact way without overbearing. Zeljko Ivanek and Stephen Root, actors you will probably recognize, also does a great job in some of the episodes.<br /><br />This is an HBO series with adult themes, so deifnately not for younger viewers."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"The dvd shipped in less than a week and played perfectly.  Great flick.  Tommy Lee Jones is almost unrecognizable! What a different role for him.  Not really the tough guy, but still the  ""tough guy,"" if you know what I mean.  Loved it."
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	"My wife and I had looked forward to this film only to be severely disappointed.<br /><br />The good in this film is entirely on Charlize Theron. Her acting is superb and you can tell that the other actors in this film are trying to rise to her level when they share scenes with her. Her queen is so evil it will give you shivers. Unfortunately, how scary-bad the rest of the film is will also give you shivers. As much as I like Chris Hemsworth, I couldn't help but feel that he was phoning this one in, at least a bit. Maybe because most of his scenes were opposite or adjascent to Kristen Stewart, I don't know for sure, but he never feels like more than a muscle-head in this film. It was like he wandered off of an action movie set and into the wrong studio. The dwarves had a lot of potential given the tremendous casting, but they are poorly used and underwhelming. The visuals are fantastic, but to be fair, they aren't anything unique in this CG-age of cinema. I didn't see anything new or innovative.<br /><br />Finally, I must jump on the bandwagon with everyone else - Kristen Stewart was dreadful. Aside from her complete lack of emotional output, I can't recall a scene in this film when her mouth was hanging open. By the end of the film, my wife and I had become so bored that we took to MST3k-ing the film, adding much dialogue about her gaping maw. It was the only way we could make it to the end. The Snow White of this film is supposed to draw great pathos from the audience, have a harrowing ordeal, and then transform into a brilliant warrior monarch. All of this is delivered with the emotional range of a mannequin. In a time when several versions of Snow White are hitting the market at once, you would think that the producers would want theirs to redefine the character, making her seem more than the fairy tale character. Instead we get a vain attempt to copy the Snow from ""Once Upon A Time"" and do so with a far inferior actress.<br /><br />This film was promoted on four major points: Stewart, Hemsworth, Theron, and the visuals. Of those four, only Theron delivers. Take her part out and this film is complete rubbish. I can't honestly recommend this to anyone."
B00447G29S	4.0	b	As to its stunning visuals, we can see no disagreement among us.  'The Polar Express' has shown where the CGIs would be leading us in the future.  However, as to its story and, well, the virtual star Tom Hanks (who looks and moves in a very weird way), there is still room for improvement to be done.  All in all I liked the film simply because I love to see newer things on the big screen.  But if you are kind of audiences who would feel dizzy after watching the flood of CGIs, you may consider buying the original book (and that's beautiful) instead.<br /><br />The original book by Chris Van Allsburg contains only 29 pages, and for the film (that runs 100 mins), Robert Zemeckis stretched the story.  Maybe he did it too much, but anyway the film follows one boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara, the kid of 'The Spy Kids') who lost his faith in Santa.  But one Christmas Eve, an old-fashioned train led by a steam locomotive stops right in front of his window.  It's The Polar Express, and The Conductor invites him to board the train to join in the travel to the North Pole.<br /><br />The rest of the story needs no summery; The Hero Boy meets new friends, sees the elves (including one cameo played by Steven Tyler), and, yes, the man in red clothes, with white beard.  The voice cast include Tom Hanks (playing five roles), Michael Jitter (playing two roles Smokey and Steamer), Norah Gaye as Hero Girl, and Peter Scolari as Lonely Boy.<br /><br />But the merit of the film is mostly the visuals (not those of humans, which, quite annoyingly, often look embalmed bodies in motion).  The snow-covered railroad track, the icy field on which the train slips as if skating, and the well-crafted designs of the town in the North Pole are all fantastic.  If only Tom Hanks appeared exactly as he is, without tampered by the 'performance capture' system (whatever it is).<br /><br />The sound effects are amazing, the songs are pretty good, but the fact remains that 'The Paolar Express' is based on a very thin book -- you know what I mean if you remember 'Jumanji' which was another film based on Chrs Van Allsburg's book.  Great images with very few things to say, that's my verdict.  And very bizarre Tom Hanks, more bizarre than him in 'The Ladykillers.'
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	This is definitely my favorite move so far in the series. Lots of action, drama, and a bit of humor. Part 2 will most likely surpass this one, tho.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	My situation is a bit different from the other reviews.  Several weeks ago, I joined the Disney Blu-Ray Movie Club. I received eight (8) very popular (ie: UP, Cars 1&2, etc) Disney BD's.  Of course the rub is that I must purchase three (3) BD's at the $31.95 price. My first purchase was $19.17 for the CARS BD Combo Gift Set, the BD Prince of Persia at $31.95, and Pirates 3 BD at $13.00.  The total for everything was $60.12 including shipping and no tax.<br />  My two grand kids couldn't wait to play with Mater & McQueen and watch Cars over & over & over.  I don't know why some folks think the cars are a cheap knock-off but the one I received are still holding up. I'm sure if you want to hold on to it, it will go up in value.  But, please, don't take my word on that!
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	My 2 year old son loves toy cars, but could never sit through the whole movie.  I like it.  Maybe he's just too young for it...although he loves the movie happy feet, and could watch it three times straight if you let him...
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"In keeping with Coen Brother tradition, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, in casting, scripting and cinematography, is masterfully subtle.  In fact, that's an overstatement. Every aspect of this piece, though seemingly and strategically understated, is wonderfully choreographed to keep from doing what Hollywood usually does -- going over the top for effect. NO COUNTRY... accomplishes its profound statement -- that life, anymore, is just about as bizarre and violent as one can imagine -- without having to force things at all.<br /><br />Much has been said about the violence of this film and the Coen Brothers' penchant for callous insensitivity toward human suffering. Accordingly, I expected a gratuitous blood bath like the one the Coen's presented in FARGO.  Nothing of the sort materializes. Instead, while the violence is graphic and, at times, stark, it isn't overdone for shock or effect.  Death here is simply the flipside of life. It begins and it ends with equal emotion and suddenness. To have presented things otherwise, with the melodramatic, shrieking, sobbing emotions that usually attend the subject, would have been to create an irreconcilable incongruity in the character of Anton Chigurh -- the maniacal murderer played here by Oscar winner, Javier Bardem -- a violent sociopath who carries out his carnage as if he were selling magazine subscriptions.<br /><br />The movie is a masterpiece. The Coens' ""every man's"" script, delivered wonderfully by Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, Barry Corbin and, of course, by Bardem, is set against the arid, sweeping panoramas of southern Texas. It's all about life but, then, it really isn't. NO COUNTRY... leaves the viewer, despite the scrapes, bumps and deaths, with a half-smile and the notion that, indeed, it could happen to almost anyone.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I absolutely loved this movie! I went to go see it the weekend it came out and I enjoyed it so much!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	True Blood is, in my opinion, one of THE best shows on TV! The story is great. The characters are so interesting and the actors that play them do such an amazing job. Every single episode leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat anticipating whats next.<br /><br />As far as the package itself, HBO did an OUTSTANDING job. The case is stunning. The pictures and texture of the case are great, and I was pretty shocked when I opened it up to find 5 discs! Most networks package TV show seasons very cheaply, with as few discs and other content as possible. This item was done very lavishly. The first season boxed set is worth every penny.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	Maybe, because I know something about how books are adapted to folm, I'm more tolerant of what was left out. You simply can not show how long Harry stayed at Grimvauld Place or the forrest of Dean, it would turn the film into a 4 very boring 4 hours. It is very fast moving film with of course a lot of action. The only bad thing I can say against it is that it shot in the dark. You have to watch it in dark.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I'm not going to say that the magic is back. It's finally arrived. The cinematography in Phoenix is astounding--scenes ebb and flow like the spells they're depicting. The effects for magic and creatuers embody the story's themes rather than distract from them. Watch the elemental opposites, the dark and light dancing in the battle scene. And call me a heretic, but the lyricism of Fred and George's flying-the-coop sequence rivals anything in Lord of the Rings. Even Creatur delights in his Dobby-antithesis mumblings. The first Potter film that made me want to pick up the books again.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"""Iron Man"" is a great movie.  It is great simply because it provides escapism fun for the length of the movie.  I cannot claim to be a Hollywood movie critic.  I am not going to dissect the acting skills of every actor or the quality of the scenes.<br /><br />All I can say is this - when a movie is over, if I feel moved because of the message it delivers or, in the case of Iron Man, I am excited about the action, etc., and can't wait to watch it again, then I consider it a great movie!<br /><br />Iron Man is a great action movie, pure & simple.  If you like things that fly, explosions, etc., all delivered with a Sci-Fi, eccentric billionaire twist, then you'll probably love Iron Man.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version is superb....explosions, fighting, etc., all provide excellent audio quality.  The video is very good.<br /><br />In summary, I think it's classic movie fun....sit back and enjoy it for what it is - a fun ride!"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Great movie. The entire movie doesnt rest on special affects alone to carry some weight. This movie from start to finish didnt dissapoint me. Great choice for a dvd collection if you like this type of movie. Then again; if you didnt read a lot of comics and dont go out of your way for this type of movie its worth a view. Move over spidey!!! I AM IRON MAN!!!
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	This is a review of the actual product quality and not the movie itself. Basically, it seems like they did a shoddy job of encoding it for DVD. One wonders if it was purposefully done to encourage people to buy Blu-Ray discs. On my HD TV, the video quality is pretty pixelated and shadow areas have too much noise in them. I have other DVDs that look much, MUCH better on my TV because the information on the actual DVD's is of much higher quality. If you wondered why the price is this cheap, you now know. That said, the actual movie is wonderful and a joy to watch!
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	Quite Simply, this is the order of Indy Films from best to worst:<br /><br />1. Raiders of the Lost Ark - 5 Stars<br />2. The Last Crusade - 4 1/2 Stars<br />3. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull - 3 Stars<br />4. Temple of Doom - 3 Stars<br /><br />If you're an Indy fan, it's an enjoyable ride, but don't set your expectations high, like Raiders and Last Crusade; the content of those films, and writing, were well above Kingdom and Temple.  Kingdom is hokey, a bit cartoonish(as some have mentioned here), and the Family Reunion was a little over the top, and very convenient suddenly for script?  e.g. Daddy-O, Junior, etc.  However, even 20 plus years later, it still holds up well to Temple of Doom and a younger Indy.  But, it doesn't hold a candle (or a torch?) to Raiders or Last Crusade.  Simply watch and have fun, and, suspend ALL belief in the real world.  Remember, in Hollywood, heroes don't get hurt or killed, UNLESS the script really needs them to!  (And, then, do they really die?)
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	You know the story, you know what it's all about, you've read the book at least three times. You went to see the movie as soon as it opened and then saw it a few times more. Don't worry, that's normal. Now you want the DVD -- well you have to complete your collection, everybody knows that.<br /><br />At the very least, put it on your wish list. Somebody looking at it will know what you appreciate and you won't get another necktie.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Very funny DVD!  Jeff is very talented, he makes you forget the puppets aren't real!  I hope he has more DVD's in the works, I will buy them all!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	Simply put, the promotional material for this film was some of the most innacurate and detrimental that I've ever seen. The Village is not a thriller. Granted, it has a few suspenseful moments, and you might even fight yourself on the edge of your seat once or twice. The core of this movie, however, is the incredibly powerful story of love that actually dominates most of the movie.<br /><br />To summarise the plot without giving anything important away, an isolated village lives in a valley surrounded by a forest. In the woods live 'those we don't speak of', mysterious and dangerous creatures who wear red and are attracted by the sight of it. The villagers placate the creatures by staying in their valley and wearing yellow (the safe colour) when near the woods. The looming threat of disease, however, causes Lucious Hunt, a quiet villager who often seperates himself from the others, to request permission to pass through the woods and retrieve medicines from the towns beyond the forest. His relationship with the beautiful, blind Ivy Walker, and the great trial that faces both of them makes for an incredibly emotional and impacting story of love that surpasses all fear.<br /><br />I can't get over the cinematography in this movie. It's simply beautiful to watch. I never really enjoyed any of M. Night's other films, but the camera work and use of colour in The Village leaves me stunned everytime. The acting is top-notch as well, specifically Bryce Dallas Howard, who gives such a convincing performance as a blind woman, that I would have thought she actually was. A very minimal musical score rounds out the package, which is perhaps the best thing Night could have done. A great deal of the The Village is totally without music, and the movie benefits from this greatly. In this way, the scenes where music is employed really stand out, and the compositions themselves are awesome.<br /><br />I wont deny that there are a lot of bad reviews out for The Village, but I just don't understand why. There are no gaping plot holes, the movie couldn't be more aesthetically appealing, and I found the final few plot twists quite unexpected. I highly recommend this film. HIGHLY.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"The movie was great. It was in widescreen and we needed full screen. We could not find it as needed so I bought what was available. Went back and looked at product description and finally found ""format"". He enjoys the movie, but would have appreciated the other format."
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"I'm not sure if it has been noted here before but another edition of ""Sin City"" is set to be released in December.  This new edition (from what I've read, mostly from a Frank Miller interview) has more special features and breaks the stories into stand alone vignettes.  So, instead of the three stories interlocking and jumping from story to story, each will be told sperately in it's entirety.  Just an FYI so everyone is aware."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I bought this to test my 3D TV and it turns out to be very nice. Amazon lost my first order, but the customer service was very nice and did a replacement very quickly.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	The tagline might have your jaw drop, but I stand by the statement and it is completely and utterly true. I have read all of the Harry Potter books, and I always found Order of the Phoenix to be a downright drag that was far too long and far too boring. However, this film adaptation really takes the best and most important parts of the book and puts it on the big screen in quite the perfect fashion.<br /><br />What I really like about this film is the dialogue is really well written and all of the actors play their parts spectacularly. Umbridge is an evil witch and she's the perfect antagonist throughout the story, and everyone from Dumbledore to Fudge does a great job during their screen time. The famous and memorable musical score created for the first film is intact for Order of the Phoenix and it's still just as awesome as it has been for the previous four years.<br /><br />But what keeps this film from being perfect? The CGI is still not the best. Granted, the Potter films stay away from CGI for a majority of the films (WHICH I LOVE...THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!), but when there is CGI, it generally looks rather pathetic. Still, there are some cool special effects to enjoy that will astonish you, even if you're some big film buff that thinks they've seen it all.<br /><br />The plot moves along at a rather quick pace, but not quick to the point that it's jarring. I'd say the plot moves perfectly, with enough action and emotion mixed in with some humor and character development. One of the most shocking moments of the film is, for some reason or another, really not given that much importance or screen time. Missed opportunity, but it doesn't ruin the film in the least.<br /><br />You'll love this film whether you're a Harry Potter fan or not. It was done masterfully, with my gripes being some untaken chances with the plot and the poor CGI in some areas. Still, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a roller coaster ride of magic and mayhem in the kind of way that only Potter can provide.
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	K-stew can not act! worst movie ever. Dont waste your money. Use real little people next time. nothing is worse then full gown men trying to act like little people. The queen was the only good thing in the movie.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Ive been looking for a hardcore workout that is fun, motivating, and one that produces results. I decided to buy Insanity after I read all the positive reviews on here. I'm so glad I went for it.<br /><br />Shaun T is informative, motivational, and fairly entertaining throughout these 40 min workouts. Ive tried EVERY workout on the market from winsor Pilate's to taebo and this is the only workout that has me hooked! There is something incredible about dripping sweat and panting after just doing the warm up!<br /><br />I'm on week 3. I can only do Insanity 4 days a week due to my 3/12 a week work schedule but I'm already seeing results. My abs and legs are more toned and I'm completing the workouts with less breaks. I would recommend this for anyone wanting to increase their endurance and get in phenomenal shape!!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This movie was superb in many ways. The story is excellent and the movies great for children and adults of all ages to remember the innocence of youth and recognize the milestones we have all passed growing up. But now on to the real essence of this review: the 3D quality.<br /><br />The 3D is VERY GOOD...in fact it's great on so many levels. The colors are vibrant and vivid and not washed out like many have complained happens when watching movies in 3D from dark glasses. Also, the picture quality was top notch in HD even while wearing glasses. The surround sound effects and audio couldn't be any more realistic and complementative of the video. The 3D was spectacular guys. Many scenes had things popping right out at you (which i love) and the depth was deep and realistic. I actually felt like I was in the movie. I have an 82 inch 3DTV so that helps but a crappy 3D movie is a crappy 3D movie no matter what screen you watch it on and crappy this was not. The 3D on this film will make any television pop and sizzle and truly brings out the power of your new 3DTV to your family and friends.<br /><br />Overall watch The Polar Express is a wonderful holiday experience anyone should have the opportunity to enjoy and if you're looking for a good 3D movie then this is a must buy as you will not be dissapointed. Furthermore I experienced no ghosting at all while watching but that could be due to my televisions technology compared to plasma, LED, and LCD. Pick up a copy for yourself. You won't regret it.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Sin City is the closest that mainstream US film has come to capturing the essence and appeal of graphic novels.<br /><br />Visually stunning, each frame of this movie is highly stylised, no less than a work of art in itself, to closely resemble the style of the graphic novels themselves.<br /><br />It is ultra-violent, this is Pulp Fiction on steroids, and will likely thrill or disgust those who love or hate the likes of Kill Bill.<br /><br />I loved it.<br /><br />It is set in the twisted environment of Sin City, part modern day, part film noir era, where among the heroes are Marv (Mickey Rourke as an ugly hulk of a man on a trail of vengeance) and Detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis doing the kind of role he was made for).<br /><br />In short, you can't take it too seriously and I find the violence totally inkeeping with the style of the movie and the work of Frank Miller.<br /><br />It's obvious that this production has gone to pains to be faithful to its source material. Therefore to make something that didn't have comic-book action and ultra-violence would have been a real sell-out.<br /><br />Fans of Frank Miller have been waiting a long time for a faithful translation of his work to the screen.<br /><br />Back when Miller produced the Graphic Novel - Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, I remember people having some hope that the remake of Batman would carry some of that film noir appeal and gritty themes.<br /><br />What did we get? Michael Keaton in a rubber suit.<br /><br />So I don't think people griping about the level of violence in this movie is really a legitimate criticism. Like Tarantino's movies, the violence is a dramatic device, and also a vehicle for humour.<br /><br />I watched this movie with someone who doesn't know the work of Frank Miller and has little love for screen violence, but they really appreciated the design, art and style that went into it.<br /><br />Plus, the storylines and source material are great with plenty of twists and turns that you rarely see in mainstream US movies these days.<br /><br />I really hope this movie will spark off sequels and other faithful adaptations of graphic novels like those from Frank Miller.<br /><br />Just to say it again - I think Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis are outstanding in this film and are perfectly cast.<br /><br />This movie is a triumph and hopefully sets a new standard to be matched by future productions. Highly entertaining.
B001OHS8BQ	2.0	b	"I wiped Kirk Cameron off my list when he fired Playmate Julie McCullough from his TV show simply for being a Playboy Playmate. I guess Mr. Cameron showers with swim trunks on...<br /><br />But to move on to other things, like FIREPROOF. The story of a young, struggling couple, FIREPROOF concerns the floundering marriage of a young firefighter and his pretty wife, who works as a hospital administrator. After a long day at work rescuing kids from burning buildings and lifting stuck cars off railroad tracks by brute force, hubby comes home to a dinner table full of nothing and a refrigerator full of his wife's favorite foods. Hubby withdraws, spending most of his home time saving for a sailboat and looking at (gasp!) naked women on the Internet (Julie McCullough does not get a cameo). ""Have you cleaned out your History folder?"" his perpetually toxic wife carps.<br /><br />As for the young missus, she spends most of her time complaining about her husband to the girls at work, and making goo-goo eyes with one of the handsome young doctors on staff. She also takes care of her elderly parents, though this bit of humanizing behavior gets glossed. Women don't come out too well in FIREPROOF.<br /><br />In the meantime, on the man front, our brave hero appears to belong to the only firehouse that runs a quilting bee. While there are a few moments of obligatorily ridiculous male bonding behavior, the hook and ladder company is more like an encounter group for spiritually bereft men. Actually, they might be bereft of other things too, or should I say two other things. Men don't come out too well in FIREPROOF.<br /><br />Still, FIREPROOF is an okay movie until it starts preaching. I'd be the last person to argue against the importance of finding a spiritual center to your life, especially in today's modern, materialistic world. And I don't care if it's Jesus or the Jonas Brothers, the Buddha or breadsticks, as long as it bestows its gifts upon you.<br /><br />But FIREPROOF takes God---the inconceivably vast and sentient consciousness that includes EVERYTHING---and reduces it all down to the size of a box of tissues. Hubby Dearest decides (with some prodding from his Mommy and Daddy) to take on a ""love dare,"" and to show his not-too-better half what love is, or can be. She isn't buying it. Not at all. He can't give the love away. Eventually she comes around and FORGIVES HIM HIS INDISCRETIONS (I guess playing Doctor with the Doctor isn't as bad as looking at Julie McCullough's photo shoot). They live happily ever after, having accepted Jesus into their lives.<br /><br />Yeah, that's nice. But real couples have real problems, and FIREPROOF's cookbook approach to relationships and its absolutely patronizing attitude toward God, really rankled me. FIREPROOF allows for no thought---just do what the Bible says, mention Jesus a few times as garnish, give the Lord a pat on the head for being your own personal mascot, and that should do the trick. Jesus really doesn't come out too well in FIREPROOF.<br /><br />I would really like to know how these self-righteous proselytizers can be SO CERTAIN that THIS is what God wants and THAT is not what God wants. I may be made in God's image, but I guarantee that God is a lot bigger, far smarter, immeasuably older, much more experienced, and infinitely more subtle than I will ever be.<br /><br />It takes one arrogant ego structure to assert that anybody except God knows what God wants, but, of course, not only does FIREPROOF tell you what God wants, but it also markets (ah, Mammon!) a whole line of marriage materials to go along with the movie. God doesn't come out too well in FIREPROOF either, but I doubt God cares that Kirk Cameron has appointed himself as His press agent. Maybe Kirk should care though.<br /><br />This is a good movie about relationships if you haven't discovered solid geometry yet."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I THINK THIS IS THE BEST COMEDY VIDEO WE HAVE EVER SEEN AND WE OWN BOTH OF THEM AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE THEM AS HE MAKES NEW ONES, WALTER IS THE BOMB. AND MY BOYFRFIEND FAVORS PEANUT BUT THE OTHERS ARE AWESOME TOO , I HAVE 3 KIDS AND 2 STEP KIDS AND THEY ALL HAVE THEIR FAVORITES ALSO. JEFF DUNHAM IS GREAT , KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK<br />SHEILA
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	This is the worst of movie-making: the Christian film.  Bad acting, bad ideas, bad plot but hey!  It has a pseudo-Christian message, so all the rest is negated.  Ugh.  I wish I hadn't let my mother beat me over the head with this for getting divorced.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Trust -- and its flip side, betrayal.  Personal, professional, familial.  Scorsese weaves an intricate tapestry of double-dealing, double-crossing, deceit and dishonesty, mixed in with an inordinate number of head-shot executions, in the seamy Boston underworld.<br /><br />What does the movie ultimately say about trust?  First, that there's not a whole lot of it for either cops or robbers, but second, that not all trust is misplaced, and honesty will at least be vindicated, even if it can never be fully compensated.<br /><br />But forget the movie's theme for a second.  Picture this plot: a determined, Donny Brasco-type mole inside an Irish gangster's criminal empire, combined with an equally determined dirty cop trying to find him.  Cat and mouse action, generous helpings of violence, a semi-demi-plausible love triangle, lots of coke and Chinese gangsters all make appearances in a surprisingly coherent and entertaining mix.  Great action and performances abound with the all-star cast as well.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I was not interested in seeing this movie but I did for my mother's birthday. The book is one of her favorites.<br /><br />I was absolutely blown away. I could not believe how horrifying Javier Bardem was as Anton Chigurh! Hannibal Lector schmector this is the guy you gotta run from. Anytime I saw him pop into the same frame as another character I'd literally shout from my seat in the theatre (it was empty though, except for my mom and I =]) at the person to run. He was so scary, and even the extras in this film were amazing. The guy at the gas station was an excellent actor, whoever he is.<br /><br />The Coen Brothers' attention to detail make this movie even better. Who knew that a candy wrapper slowly unfolding could cause so much tension?<br /><br />Anyway, I loved it and after seeing it in the theatre went home to preorder it. I saw it in theatres two more times as well, and after watching the other Oscar nominated films and performances I think the academy got this right-- especially with Javier Bardem for best supporting actor. Wow!
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	I really really wanted to like this movie, but it is a travesty on many levels. The whole thing seems like a retread, and the script is filled with cliches and nonsense (yes, I do think I could have done a better job).<br /><br />This film a horrible thing to do a character loved by so many. At least since it's a sequel (unlike the Star Wars prequels), it's not too hard to pretend that it just never happened. As far as I'm concerned, there are only three Indiana Jones movies, which I love dearly (yes, even Temple of Doom, even though it's not nearly as good). Please don't subject yourself or your kids to this, and don't reward anyone associated with this garbage with your hard-earned money.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"Prometheus is an intelligent, amazing, visually arresting  and thrilling film. A science fiction masterpiece who I belive will suffer the same fate as Blade Runner - heralded as a brilliant film in the future despite being dished by many presently. The story is amazing, the characters are interesting, the suspense and revelations are build perfectly. The movie is very influenced by Lovecraft, in particular his story ""At The Mountains Of Madness"" and it is clear that that is intended considering the massive wink towards the end when a ""Cthullu like"" alien makes an appearence. The film has been very criticized and from my perspective, unfairly so; to be quite frank alot of the critiques were very unacurate and many times it was clear that alot of people just didn't understand much of the plot. Much is said about supposed plot holes, but it all comes down to one thing: many didn't understand the movie because many did not figure out the reason the engeneers created men. Once that reason is figured out (and there are many clues in the film that enable us to conclude as to what that reason is) the movie makes absolute sense. Many accused the characters of acting in a random fashion. That is completly false. There is a reason for the character's actions and many feel there are not because they expect characters to be likeable and nice. Think outside the box, please, and understand that the humanoid does not follow any morals, he aims only to follow it's creator's directives and achieve knowledge regardless of the price; some of the characters are not bad or good, just something in between like most human beings. Overall, a brilliant film both visually and plotwise. I hope the negativity doesn't keep the studios from doin the much needed and from my end, desired,  sequel."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is very, very funny.  I laughed through out the whole video. Be prepared to fall in love with his friends and have a good time.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	The 3D graphics are awesome, even on a small 27 inch screen. I have recommended it to all my friends and plan on giving it as a gift next year.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	"I have actually read and enjoyed Frank Miller's comics, and really loved the Kill Bill series.<br /><br />Once you get over the ""hey neat"" factor of the movie's use of color to achieve its comic book style, you are left with a movie that is relentlessly, gruesomely and - for the most part - pointlessly violent.  The characters are all, well, comic book cutouts and some are supposed to be ""protagonists"" and some ""antagonists"" (there are no good guys or bad guys, they are all bad), but you really don't care what happens to any of them.  This movie was one of the rare occasions when I almost walked out in the middle..."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Bought this as a gift.  They loved it.  I would recommend this to anyone who was into this type of stuff.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I have long been an Adams fan since watching the PBS series The Adams Chronicles in the 70's. The books by Joseph Ellis (Founding Brothers, Passionate Sage, American Sphinx, and At the Creation) served to further deepen my esteem and appreciation for our second President, warts and all.  The HBO mini-series John Adams is an outstanding portrayal and interpretation of David McCullough novel, bring John, his wife Abigail, and the times in which they lived and struggled vividly to life.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KEHAFI"">Fireproof</a><br />This is an excellent movie.  It has action, humor, and pathos.  It should be seen by EVERY married couple. as well as those who want to have meaningful relationships."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I bought this DVD because I had to add it to my library. It wasn't enough to be able to watch it on Netflix...I had to have a copy. It makes sense.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This DVD is one of the funnist I've seen. I've watched it about 10 times already. Ackmed, Walter & Peanut are the best!!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"This disk is going to provide you with all the laughter you is ever going to need, and together with Jeff Dunham's ""Spark of Insanity"" this disk could become a potential killer.<br /><br />The amount of stomachake and jaw-pains i had after this film is indescribable. The humour he provides is right on the spot, every single time."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	If you're a fan of early America era movies and stories, then this is for you! HBO does it again with a very high quality, well acted story. If you're a fan of other HBO series like ROME, then you will love John Adams.
B005ZMUQCK	1.0	b	This rate is for the product, not for the movie.<br />Wy? the case say: Eng Spanish and French subtitles.<br />NO Spanish and NO French subtitles in the disc.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	Qualifying as gleeful entertainment, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull definitely doesn't come close to the greatness achieved by the first three Indy flicks, but it isn't nearly as bad as many have claimed it to be either.  Harrison Ford makes a triumphant return to his defining role as the fedora wearing, whip wielding adventurer; who is coerced by a young greaser named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) into taking a trip to Peru to rescue his mother (Raiders of the Lost Ark love interest Karen Allen) and friend (John Hurt) who knows the secrets of the fabled Crystal Skull.  With a team of Soviets (led by Cate Blanchett) hot on his tail as well, the aging Indy certainly has his hands full.  The biggest flaw of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is that it is ever so predictable.  Any of the big twists, revelations, or surprises you will see coming a mile away; and the biggest plot element of all is so weakly inserted here that you'll wonder just what it's doing in an Indiana Jones movie.  Still though, there's just something about the film that still makes it worth seeing regardless, with spectacular stunt work and action sequences, and the fact that Ford still stands tall as one of the best screen heroes in all of cinema history.  All in all, despite its many flaws, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an enjoyable romp that many will no doubt be split on, but in the end, seeing Indy back in action is reason enough to celebrate.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	and that's what really matters to me. My husband is a tall and a big guy (macho type *lol*), who you'd think would not get the message the movie is conveying. But he did. He had tears in his eyes and he appreciates more of our marriage relationship. Marriage is not something we should take for granted, in fact, it is when a couple should try harder to make a marriage work. All married couple should have the book A Love Dare that the main character used to save his marriage. The movie is not a Hollywood production full of great Oscar winning dramatic acting. However, it's a natural acting that anyone could relate to. The performers are not known except Kirk Cameron. But the movie conveyed a simple truth that marriage and divorce do not go together. That if God is in the center of a couple's lives and they acknowledge God's guidance in their lives through His instructions and commands, a marriage stands a chance in surviving throughout a couple's lifetime. The marriage relationship is sweeter, full of love, understanding and, full of respect and trust for one another. My husband got emotional especially at the end when Kirk's character's dad revealed something to him that the son did not know about his own parents' marriage relationship. My husband really took it to heart. God is working in both my husband and I's lives. We had a rough start, but when God came into our lives, things definitely have changed for the better. All married couple secretly wish that in their relationship. That's why any couple can relate to the storyline--it's very common, but what to do to save a crumbling or a marriage that is collapsing is another thing. A man and a woman who decide to get married have to completely turn to God for guidance, it is the only way. God created marriage and He is the only One who knows how it would work in perfect harmony. This movie is a tearjerker especially for those who are going through rough times with their marriage, in the process of divorce or already separated and been divorced. This movie will touch a chord emotionally. The producers of this movie also were responsible for another great movie Flywheel, another eye opening storyline.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Excellent DVD, Jeff Dunham never fails to make me laugh. Delivery was surprisingly quick and the price was amazing! Highly recommend this DVD :)
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I bought this series because I had not seen the first season in its entirety. I was so happy when I found it on sale. I bought it and it arrived that week. It is a great show and very entertaining.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"""Iron Man"" is one of the best action movies I have seen in quite some time. Not a graphic novel reader, I was unaware of the plot until I saw the movie. The writing, acting and production work all came together and produced a wonderfully entertaining escape for fiction lovers like myself. I would even recommend this movie to those who do not usually watch science fiction or fantasy action films. Well done."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff's got to be one of the funniest comedians around.  I strongly suggest seeing him Live!!!  The DVD is great, however nothing beats a good live performance.......
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I laughed until I sobbed.  It's not appropriate for kids, but it's great fun for adults.  Hilarious performance!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	The Fireproof movie featured The Love Dare Book and both center around improving marriages by working on the core structure of couples, their hearts. The Love Dare book is a 40-day guided devotional adventure, aimed at teaching the reader and their partner how to love God and each other the right way, and how to put unimportant nuisances aside. Each day's reading encompasses a Bible verse, a principle statement, a dare to be performed that day, room to write your thoughts, and a check box to evaluate progress. This movie presents the characters performing the daily dares in an attempt to bring the relationship back together and to show the other person that they love, care, and value them. With this movie's reputation, in combination with The Love Dare book, these can change marriages and eliminate even the idea of divorce in crumbling relationships; this is a must view for couples.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Loved, loved, loved it.  If you're a fan of sci-fi this movie is a must-add to the roster of great sci-fi.  With amazing characters this great sci-fi flick becomes a character study, even robots enhance the drama. In my opinion best scene ever in a movie-spoiler alert-when Roonie Mara's character performs surgery to rid her body of an alien-epic.  Must see.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I learned from this video that even if you don't feel too well you can still laugh until the tears roll down your cheeks and feel better.<br />It was so nice to meet my alter ego...peanut.<br />P.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I've read the other reviews, and I somewhat agree with most. I've always been a fan of Rodriguez, if only because of his sheer originality; though a buddy of Tarantino, he can still maintain his individuality and integrity. One reviewer didn't like the voice over; if he'd watched the best of 40's film noir, he'd he'd realize that they all had voice over, and for a reason: Precision. I was totally blown away with the originality of the whole thing; appropriate black & white photography, with splashes of color that intrigue. I agree with the guy who said this DVD is lacking in extras; no doubt. This project must have been so complex, I'm very interested to hear more about background stuff. The acting is excellent throughout. I particularly was impressed with Mickey Rourke, as well as Brittany Murphy. Benicio del Toro played his somewhat carricature part as if nothing could be more fun. This film is indeed a wild roller coaster of a ride, not unlike ""Pulp Fiction"", but a little more clever and even poetic. I thought the script was wonderful. This is indeed a sort of ""parallel universe"" kind of ride, and I was continuously entertained.Rodriguez' originality has strengthened my admiration of his talent. Watching this was so much fun!"
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	"In the end, after a long race and countless detours, Cars comes swinging around the final turn with a pretty nice message about life. About winning and losing. About how to win ... and how to lose. It's a message you hear often enough, but usually it's simply an empty truism without much heart. ""It's not if you win or lose, but how you play the game,"" etc., ad nauseum. Cars communicates that message in a genuine, heartfelt way that can't help but reach young and old alike. That, in the end, is what is really good about this film. And, in the end, it's also the most important thing in any movie for children: Do they learn something of lasting value that otherwise might be lost upon them?<br /><br />But, unfortunately, Cars lacks the pacing, vitality, and spirit of Pixar's other films.  The story feels like an early draft that should have been cut and polished -- and cut and polished again. Sequences seem interminable. Points get hashed and rehashed. Movies, especially those for little ones, need to be economical, not bloated. They need to know the point where the length of a scene may destroy its vitality -- and then cut it back way before then. Pixar's done it right so many times, that I've come to take it for granted that its writers are champs at it. Not here.<br /><br />The overwrought nature of the story, coupled with a lack of the adult-oriented (and amusing) subtext that keeps parents interested in the great children's films, makes for a very long ride indeed for folks over forty. In addition, many of the characters seemed like ""cookie cutter"" cliches, something that seemed wholly unnecessary and not exactly a view of the world that's good for tender ears.<br /><br />Maybe Cars, when it reaches the shelves on DVD, will result in a first among director's cuts: a shorter movie.<br /><br />Nah. It'll never happen."
B0006989TE	3.0	b	This is only the second M. Night Shyamalan movie that I've seen (the first being &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;), and sadly, it seems that &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; is both a blessing and a curse for Shyamalan. After four films where a huge twist is revealed at the end, it seems that the films have become somewhat formulaic. I think that the best twist ending for his next movie would be that it should have no twist.<br /><br /> Anyway, this movie takes place in a secluded, unnamed village in Pennsylvania. The villagers have lived here their entire lives, and no one has ever left or arrived. This is because of the dark creatures that reside in the woods surrounding the village. As long as the villagers don't go into the woods, the creatures won't bother them. However, after the deaths of some of the residents, Lucious Hunt (Joquain Phoenix) decides that he must venture to &quot;The Towns&quot; to retrieve some medicine to prevent further deaths. However, the elders of the village, who serve as the governing body, determine that it not worth risking everyone in the village to save a few. After this, events involving a love triangle between Hunt, Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), the blind daughter of one of the elders, and Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), a mentally challenged man, occur. Also the creatures begin to cross the borders into the village, striking fear into the townspeople. And then, in the big twist ending...<br /><br /> Just kidding. On the subject of the ending however, I have to brag that I was able to figure it out about three quarters into the film. As surprising as the ending is, it doesn't have all the shock that &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; did. Oh well. This movie will entertain you. If you are unsure about whether you want to see it, maybe you should wait for the DVD release, however, I think that this is kind of a theater movie as many aspects will be more enjoyable on a huge screen and in surround sound.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is one of the greatest Christian movies ever produced! I was very satisfied with the DVD I purchased from this seller. The DVD was used, but like new.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This movie is Art . I am having directing and acting classes in the university of Rome for 3 years and all i can tell is that this movie is one of the best ever made . Perfect black and white shot with great use of technicolor and and color shot spits . The acting is breathtaking and the story represents perfect the society in which we live today . It has messeges against racism , nasism and the domination of church . It has messeges of fenism , because it shows how can women be strong in such situations . The (mainly)jazz music fits perfect and the movie is also full of tarantino - like black humour . The sceneries seem to be something between a movie and a comic book . There is too much violence but it is used in a way to seem like something odd and disgusting , rather than most hollywood movies which use like it is something natural . All the actors have done great job , and they fit perfect to they role . Especially mickey roork , benicio del toro , clive owen and all the girls in the movie (alexis bledel i think is the highlight) are amazing . A total must have (forgive for my poor english please)
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"I first saw Jeff's stand up at a conference I waa attending in Arizona. I laughed so hard , I could hardly talk. after returning home I went out looking for his DVDs. I now have them all... and absolutely love them. My husband and I sit down and watch them often and laugh our hearts out. I love all of his ""buddies"", but of course my favorite is PEANUT. I am waiting for more DVDs to come...... Thank you Jeff for the laughs."
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	A real eye-opener.  This video will make you want to know where your food comes from and what's really in it.  No wonder we're one of the fattest and unhealthiest countries in the world.  It's made me a real fan of my local farmer's markets.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This is a wonderful movie for the young and the young at heart. I already owned a copy of this and we bought this copy for our grandson this past Christmas. He loves it so much he has already watched it at least six times.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I also bought this video for family intertainment at Christmas time,it was a huge hit,there was so much laughter,it made our Christmas that much better,get both of his dvds if you don`t already have them....you will not regret...very funny!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I was facinated and thrilled by the first season of True Blood on DVD.  I had read all the 'Sookie Stackhouse' books written by Charlaine Harris and couldn't put them down.  When I watched the first season of True Blood, I was a little disturbed at first that it did not follow the books exactly as they were written.  After a couple episodes though, I was completely enthralled with the differences and amazed that the writters of the TV series could come up with material as original and creative as this.  Kudos to all those involved with True Blood!
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	The item arrived quickly and in pristine condition. I am thoroughly satisfied with this transaction. My only problem rests with the 'movie' itself. It stuck too close to the book. (grin)
B00447G29S	4.0	b	I too saw the movie in 3-D.  It surpassed my expectations of an animated movie.  The special effects of 3-D added another dimension to animation: you feel the snowflakes falling, and I remember the reflection/image of viewing the character from below ice. Everyone falls in love with the Polar Express train as its engine appears bigger than life.<br /><br />I would also give the 3-D version 5 stars.  Is it available?
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Poorly acted. Poorly executed. Good idea. Zero character development. The story line is disjointed and does not flow. It appears the director tried to emulate Peter Jackson, but fell short.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"John Adams, the HBO miniseries is a phenomenal account of the beginnings of our great country, as well as an insightful look into the personal and family life of one of our founding fathers. It is a lesson on American History that I've never before seen so well portrayed. The authenticity of the times and places is remarkable, historians would agree. Only through the details of the lives of the people that lived during that exciting time in our history, can we truly know what they endured in their daily lives - and how much they sacrificed for the freedoms we enjoy (currently) today.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series as one to have in any home video library, as well as any school library as it tells the story of the birth of American as no ""history"" book can - with vivid details and imagery. I did not read David McCullough's book, on which this series was based, but I can only imagine its own depth, given the amount of information conveyed in the film.<br /><br />A word on the acting: Masterful. For a piece such as this, casting is critical and the producers hit the mark. Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney, David Morse, Tom Wilkinson and Sarah Polley are among the top talent Hollywood has, and they came together to perform this account fantastically."
B000H7I6CU	3.0	b	Maybe it's me.  I bought this DVD, enhanced for 16 X 9 televisions, and I am less than happy.  All other previous Disney/Pixar movies filled up the screen on my set....this one gives me black bars.  I also have to go into the audio set up menu every time to select the Dolby Digital 5.1 option....I didn't have to do that on their other movies.  The movie is great, but the execution/delivery of the DVD is sub-par at best.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	I can't add to much of the disappointment already written about this film, suffice to say it's another huge disappointment that I lay at the feet of the once-great-but-now-obviously-insane George Lucas. Swinging through trees with monkeys after speeding cars? Really? This movie is a CGI-enhances mess with no plausible plot, poor acting and even poorer direction. After ruining Star Wars with the Episode I, it seems George Lucas simply isn't content until he ruins every good childhood movie that I enjoyed while growing up. Shame on you, Lucas.

B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I don't typically go for movies of this nature, but when my 41 year old daughter told me how much she enjoyed it, I decided I should check it out. I concur, it is a great, entertaining movie.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Jeff's alter egos are absolutely hilarious!  My husband and I laughed so hard we were crying...  These ""personalities"" take a life of their own, it's easy to forget they're actually ventriloquist's dummies.<br /><br />And make sure you check out the outtakes, more laughs for your money, be sure of that."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	HBO Series True Blood is perfect to me! This is the only show that has kept me anticipating every new episode. Now I had not read the books prior to watch the show, so seeing comments from all of Charlaine's of all the differences between the show and books prompted me to go ahead and purchase at least books 1-4 today.<br /><br />However I doubt even after reading the books that my perception will change. I love the show and the Bill Compton and Sookie Stackhouse characters are wonderful. I think the casting of Anna Paquin as Sookie and Stephen Moyer as Bill was brilliant!<br /><br />I'm glad to hear that HBO has renewed the show for a 2nd season and I cannot wait until the entire season one is available on DVD. I have all 1-4 episodes aired so far on DVR so that's my Bill and Sookie fix until every Sunday at 9 pm.<br /><br />[...]
B002QZ1RS6	3.0	b	"Age: 26  Weight:185 lbs<br /><br />I usually do some pushups and situps about 4 times a week and in my job I walk about 2 miles a day, sometimes fast paced walking. When I stepped into this program I knew it was going to be tough but it was way harder than any workout I have ever done. It is like some other reviewers have said, ""impossible"" ,to keep up with the instructer during the excercises. They move way to fast and it seems like I'm constantly staring at the screen saying ""Are you F#$@ing serious?"" a lot. The program is very repetitive so I don't know why it comes with so many DVD's when a lot of the same excercises are on each DVD. They also only put one to two workouts on each DVD which range from 30 to about 45 minutes a piece so they obviously could have made this into a 3 to 4 disc set easily. The nutrition guide isn't of much help because basically all it suggests is just different meals with what could easily be summed up on the back of the box as---> (During the 60 days of this workout DO NOT EAT FRIED FOOD) The instructer, Shaun T., is a great motivator and teacher but I think he had some other single disc DVD's that could offer the same advice but keep a lot more money in your wallet. I would try looking those up. All in all I just don't think this workout is worth the money. Make sure you check with your doctor before you start this or any workout. Peace."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	The Polar Express rates as one of favorite movies!  I lost the first disc I had, so was glad to replace it through amazon.com!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I never realized what an important figure John Adams was in the birth of our country until I viewed this DVD.  This film definitely showed John's contributions to our American history.  I recommend this to anyone, especially those who love historical personalities.  The music score was excellent.  Highly recommended.  Prepare to be enlightened.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"We've all seen the plot holes and scientific inaccuracies listed online. This movie is an insult to science fiction and an insult to Alien. The writer from Lost? Really? The guy who answered all of his questions with, ""Oh, never mind. They were in purgatory the whole time, so nothing I wrote up until now matters."" He's a garbage writer and should be blacklisted."

B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	"For fans of Harry Potter, reviews are beside the point.  They will adore ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth film in the lucrative Warner Brothers franchise based on the enormously popular J.K. Rowling books.  But for average, non-Potter addicted movie goers, this installment will have a strong sense of deja vu.<br /> The current film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) concluding a summer among the Muggles.  As his cousin and his cousin's sneering posse taunt Harry and try to provoke a fight, they are set upon by a couple of Dementors.  Harry uses magic to vanquish them, a feat that lands him in hot water at Hogwarts.  He has used magic in the presence of a Muggle.  Put on trial, Harry is exonerated only by the intervention of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).<br /> The theme of the film is established in this opening sequence:  The potential for good and evil exists in everyone.  The path to either is fraught with consequences.  The person you become rests with the choices you make.<br /> Harry and pals Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) discover changes at Hogwarts that are detrimental and destructive, and must covertly develop their powers to combat them.  The fascistic Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) has been sent to Hogwarts by the Ministry to fix everything that's wrong.  She installs a new, useless curriculum that contains no means for the student wizards to defend themselves against threats from the Dementors and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).<br /> Unlike earlier Potter films, ""Order of the Phoenix"" devotes surprisingly little screen time to the Harry/Ron/Hermione friendship.  In fact, Ron and Hermione are more like supporting than main characters.  Director David Yates and screenwriter Andrew S. Walsh have streamlined the novel to avoid an overly long running time, but the movie suffers in the details, some visuals, subplots (especially of Ron), and character development.<br /> Radcliffe is lankier and with more of a brooding quality than in previous Potter films, and his acting has matured.  He keeps his Harry grounded, even though a world of fantasy is the film's milieu.  His ability to make Harry a young Everyman is a key element in the movie series' success.  Radcliffe gives Harry a darker coloring this time so that he becomes less the fun-loving kid, amazed and thrilled at every new experience.  As an almost-adult, he sees real danger in the world around him.  Rather than leaving these dangers to the adults to reckon with, he is at the fore in confronting them himself.  His sense of responsibility to a greater good is being tested in ""Order of the Phoenix,"" and this growth of character draws us in.<br /> Next to Radcliffe, Ms. Staunton has the most central role in ""Order of the Phoenix.""  Her Dolores Umbridge is every child's nightmare of the authoritarian figure from hell.  Self-righteous, power-hungry, toadying to her superiors, nit picking and petty, she has been armed with carte blanche from on high to destroy all independent thinking and competence at the school.  Dressed in assorted suits of flamingo pink hues and chirping with ominous cheer, she is everywhere, sticking her nose in corners, taking notes on teachers' performance and evaluating the school's efficiency as one might check on a factory's assembly line output.  Ms. Staunton, nominated for her moving performance as ""Vera Drake,"" gives a broad, over-the-top performance that sometimes renders her Umbridge a bit cartoonish, but it is nonetheless fun to watch this veteran chow down on the scenery.<br /> Gary Oldman, as Sirius Black, becomes Harry's ally in battling the forces of evil and comes off as a sort of young Ben Kenobi as he mentors and fights beside Harry.  Ralph Fiennes, in horrid make-up and prosthetics, is unrecognizable as Voldemort, but succeeds in infusing him with both stature and menace.  Fiennes' screen time is brief, but his Voldemort commands every scene he's in.<br /> Special effects are present in ""Order of the Phoenix,"" of course, but they're not as frequent or impressive as in the earlier Potter films.  When we do have an effects sequence, it is welcome, and usually fits well into the unfolding story.  There is a sense of wonder, for instance, when the young wizards secretly practice their spells and apparition-like animals dart hither and yon.  There is also a wonderful sequence of winged creatures transporting Harry and his friends over the countryside, and one of the mysterious, shadowy centaurs grouped menacingly in the dark of the woods.<br /> The Catch-22 of the Harry Potter movies is the belief that if not all of the book's sequences are included in the movie, loyal fans will rise up in protest.  On the other hand, if every sequence is included, the movie becomes a three-hour exercise in bladder control.<br /> Director Yates understands this dilemma and has gone the route of a tight running time, though at 138 minutes, it could still stand some trimming.  I have always felt that a movie should stand on its own and not depend on every viewer knowing every plot turn or slavishly including every sequence.  No movie can provide the detail that a book can, nor do movies have the time to do it.<br /> ""Order of the Phoenix"" comes off as a less-than-stellar adaptation of the Rowling book."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I liked Robert Downey, Jr. in Air America. After that, he went semi-ballistic with his substance abuse problems, and I didn't like Robert Downey, Jr. anymore.<br />I've been an Iron Man fan, off-and-on, since Shell Head popped up in Marvel's pantheon, back in the Sixties and got a chest full of shrapnel in 'Nam.<br />I NEVER thought Downey-the-dope-freak could be Tony Stark, the heroic heart attack in an Iron vest, fighting for the American way.<br />All I can say is, MAN! Was I Ever WRONG?? Oh, YEAH!! Big Time WRONG.<br />Well whaddaya know? It Works! Robert Downey, Jr. can drop the Junior part whenever he decides to, because he's playing in the Big Leagues again! This one is Out Of The Park; Downey, Bridges, Howard, Paltrow - ALL the main cast did an EXCELLENT JOB.<br />And, just in case there's anyone still out there who HASN'T seen it but wants to, I'll shut up now. Go spend the money for the theater, then spend it again for the DVD (Get the Blu-Ray if you've got the machine for it), and ENJOY!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Look, I don't know you, what you're into...maybe your developmentally disabled and the last movie you rented was Oceans 13 and it was the height of your movie watching career. I don't know. Just lemme tell you one thing- you will love this movie. Even if your mental or like 9 years old or from the southern region of the US, you'll watch this movie and at the end you'll stand up and say ""I effing loved that movie!"""
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Great movie. I love Frank millers's books and this movie translates well to the screen.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Fireproof was a surprise. It's got poor acting in almost universally, which I expected; but I was amazed at the depth of the plot. The dialogue was clever and memorable, and the filming/cinematography was actually quite lovely. But of course it's the message that got me. Absolutely fantastic, finely crafted, genuinely delivered... and the acting in the second half was better than the first. Stick it out, and you'll get quite a treat!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	After I rented this the first time I knew it was something I wanted to own.  It is fascinating seeing the revolution from John Adams point of view.  Especially since he was in France and the Netherlands for a good chunk of it, and as the first vice-president he really had little say in passing new legislation.  He took an intersting observers view and I found the show well acted and informative.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Book 7 was not my favorite book, mostly because I feel like Rowling just killed people off for the sake of killing them off, and she really should have let SOME of my favorite characters live through it.<br /><br />That being said, part one was pretty true to the book (as others have stated), so most of my complaints about it are the same ones I had about the book (too slow, Ron being whiny, too many pointless deaths, etc).  I really did not enjoy the dance scene between Harry and Hermione.  I felt uncomfortably like a peeping tom while watching it (I don't go to movies to feel uncomfortable), and I don't like that they tried to create ""tension"" between Harry and Hermione.  They are just friends, and I don't know why they decided to spend 30 seconds flirting with the idea of 'more'.<br /><br />I really did not think that they gave Hedwig's death enough time or showed very well how upsetting it was to Harry.  When Dobby died, I could not understand why someone didn't try to help him.  They just sat there looking sad at him.  Harry has been injured badly several times, and they always manage to heal him back up...but Dobby isn't worth it?<br /><br />It really was too long.  I hate how all 'serious' movies seem like they are required to be over 2 hours long anymore.  This one, with a lot of material, could be justifiably long, but if I find myself sitting in the theatre hoping for it to end, then in my opinion the story or the director has at least partially failed.  I enjoyed the movie, but I still felt I was in that theatre for about 4 hours, and the last 30 minutes of the film every time the screen went dark I prayed that it was over.  I know that sounds conflicted, but its how I felt about it.<br /><br />I also hate the ""shaky camera"" fad in movies over the last decade.  This one wasn't too bad about it, but it felt like all of the non-action scenes were filmed with a little flip camera by a high school student.  I wanted to shout at the director to invest in a tripod.<br /><br />My only other minor complaint is that the director seemed to really enjoy having the bad guys straddle the good guys (dead or alive), and it felt awkward.<br /><br />I still really liked it, but I won't be watching it again til it comes out on DVD, whereas previous installations I have seen in the theatre several times.  I will, of course, go see the second part, but I don't really look forward to it.  I dont want all the characters to die off.  I almost hope that pt 2 will be a classic example of hollywood rewriting so that at least a few of the good background people live.<br /><br />To address the complaints of ""confusing"", my advice is to watch the first 6 movies.  its part 7.  its not supposed to be a stand alone.  if you've watched the first 6 movies, then its really not confusing at all.<br /><br />so, to sum up (now that I've complained enough)<br />Pros:<br />great acting<br />true to book<br />good story<br />enjoyable<br /><br />cons:<br />shaky camera<br />too long (multiple ""false"" ending spots)<br />awkward scenes that didn't 'fit'.<br /><br />go see it in the theatre. its as worth the 10 buck admission price as any other movie of recent release."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This series is one of the best things I have ever seen on TV. It brought that very important history alive and it made me appreciate the great contribution of John Adams to our history. He was indeed a great man. The acting was first-rate and the settings were magnificent. I have been thoroughly delighted. The special features were very interesting also.It would be wonderful if more similar movies could be done on America's history.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	This Indiana Jones had lots of action, and it had a good plot until the ending.  It did not have the same affect on me as the original 3 films, but Harrison Ford was a whole lot younger then.  The romance was kind of like an old man making it with much younger women and his age showed in several shots.  He is not quite as caviler as he had been, and did not have that sane old pizzazz, but that might have been in the screen play.  For the most part the performance was good though and the movie was worth adding to my collection.  I felt the worst part was the ending, talk about corny, this even tops AIs ending in that category.  So I give it a 3 out of 5.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Great movie. a must see.  world class cast, and will make you think twice if some one asks you to call heads or tails.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	There has never been a more successful translation of a graphic novel to the screen.  The entire mood of the picture, from cinematography, to dialogue, to acting, is a faithful and stunning conversion of the novel to the movie.  Each carefully composed scene, each piece of artfully stunted dialogue, the stylised yet substantial characters, all ring true to the directors vision of an artful and accurate translation from one media to the other.  Yes it's violent, yes it has stereotypes, get over it. That's what the movie is, and if you don't like it don't watch it.  I thought it was stunning and original.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	This is a great documentary for anyone who wants to take back the country from the atheists and all other radicals.<br /><br />Watch the movie and see for yourself how close-minded our society has become towards.... G-O-D.<br /><br />The way Dawkins bumbles all over his words and theories opposite a cool and collected Ben Stein is priceless!<br /><br />Intelligent Design 1,Darwinsim 0.<br /><br />Go Ben Stein!
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	This ventrilaquist has a unique act. He's not as good at his ventriliquism as say Terry Fadder but I think his act is much funnier. The vidio can be watched with beeps or swearing, either way there's not alot of swearing. His characters can be real or fictional with alot of different senarios. I'm looking to buy another of his vidios.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	Walk down the right back alley and you can find anything in Sin City, the tagline of Frank Miller's entertaining B&W/Color action packed triumph. One of the most violent movies I've ever, but a breathtaking amazing experience, I saw it in the theater and I've never seen any movie like it before. It was very different. A thrilling and electrifying story of detectives, hookers, crooks and others in a dark city who get a dose of their medicine. An allstar cast including Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Benico Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and Mickey Rourke. If like action and good comic book story telling, then this one of the best ever made. It's like a dark Dick Tracy. experience the adreline rush and the excitement of this must see and own comic book triumph.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Not only is Iron Man one of the best Marvel movies to date, but the combination of amazing CGI and a Blu-ray disc is simply unmatchable. Put this baby in to your top notch theater setup and prepare to be blown away.
B00447G29S	2.0	b	Zemeckis and this NEW SCAM should be held accoountable to customers that purchase this FAKE OLD FASHIONED 50'S STYLE 3-D TOTAL GARBAGE!<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE!!!  This IS NOT ANY GOOD 3-D AT ALL!!!  This is the OLD red & blue GARBAGE they use back in the 1950's.<br /><br />Zemeckis and the company that released this version should be ashamed and made to give REFUNDS TO ALL that GOT SCAMMED and bought this GARBAGE 3-D version of this film.<br /><br />I seen this movie in IMAX 3-D and it was the absolute best 3-D production (still to this day) ever made.<br /><br />To not at least give us the current style 3-D that Disney Digital 3-D can bring veiwing audiences, is a total shame and I feel I GOT RIPPED OFF!!<br /><br />As the first rewiew, when my wife and I seen this was being available in #0D we were estatic.  Bring it home to find out it's THE WORST 3-D FOR ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN!  Even the campy 50's 3-D's were better.  This 3-D has DOUBLE IMAGE and aggrivated our eyes (and even a couple of friends we wanted to show how BAD THE 3-D on this DVD is) within 10mins. of viweing.<br /><br />I tried EVERYTHING to adjust by contrast, brightness, colors, interlance, progressive, movie mode, etc., EVERYTHING, and nothing would improve the quality of this HORRIBLE 3-D DVD release.<br /><br />It is a total DISGRACE and Zemeckis & Company SHOULD REFUND ALL BUYER'S MONEY!<br /><br />With the IMAX 3-D sequential this should have been released in, or at least a Digital 3-D.<br /><br />In my opinion THIS DVD IS A SCAM FOR THOSE WISHING TO VIEW IT AGAIN FINALLY AT HOME IN 3-D.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Incredible tale of ""protect and serve"" gone mad and the choices made that result in way too much carnage of which the director is well known."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Excellent, fair, factual analysis<br /><br />Many reviews that shred this video actually are prime examples of what this video is trying to expose: the religious devotion many scientists show toward darwin's theory rivals any church they love to criticize.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Martin Scorcese is definitly a brilliant director, there is just no question, but many were angry that this was the movie for which he was finally recognized at the Academy Awards. I enjoyed this movie immensely, watching it over and over.<br /><br />The thing about this movie that is so genuis to me is there are two characters living very different lives coming to the same result.<br /><br />Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon enter state police training. Matt Damon passes with flying colors and is immediately made into a sergeant. His secret, he is friends with Jack Nicholson,(Costello) a very evil mastermind that generates just about all of the cities crime. He is based on a true character of that time with a few small changes. Scorcese even recruited the police chief that worked on the case for a small part in honoring the new state police which I found to be very noble. Leonardo DiCaprio doesnt quite make it through the state police due to his background they don't quite trust him with the responsiblity. As he fails that, and is told he could be an astronaut not a statey, he is recruited to be undercover in Costellos crew to finally catch him and his gang once and for all. Costello ends up liking him, while questioning his motives.<br /><br />Excellent movie, lots of decisions to be made which leads us to a very complex conclusion. Superb acting from many of our leading men including Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg. Definitly worth your time, and worth owning.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	My daughter is a huge HP fan and she really likes it on Blu-Ray due to the improved image quality as well as all the additional features.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	They are both creationists who hate the work of Darwin. Intelligent Design is creationism and the Nazi's banned the work of Darwin, Ben stein doesn't know what he is talking about because he has never read mein campf or origin of species, he is drawing a link between two things he doesn't know about. The ID movement is intellectually sloppy and that is why they aren't allowed in, they don't want to go through the normal process, they haven't even tried. They haven't been expelled they just never filled out the application. That and they totally ripped off the XVIVO inner working of a cell video, with out a doubt it is impossible that they got to the same place on their own.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	The Spanish version comes with both the Mexican and Latinamerica (I personally prefer that because it was the version that originally saw in theaters for Costa Rica).
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Have the movie on VCR tape, but wanted it on DVD.  Grandkids got me hooked on Harry Potter (both books and movies).
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Adults love this movie, too.  This is one of the better Disney movies of late.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This mini series was outstanding.  I feel that I have learned a lot more about the freeing of our country and understand more clearly what our fore fathers went through.  I have more of an understanding about the lives of the people of that time and how hard it was for them especially the women. I recommend this movie series with the highest praise.  Kept you wondering what the next part of the series held for you.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" - the movie version - IS missing lots of content from its book counterpart. Also, the screenplay has wrought a lot of big changes on the book's content and chronology. If you're a book-to-film conversion purist, or a HP Book fanatic, this fact, before anything else, might well keep you from enjoying the movie to the full. That said, if you can go into this one with an open mind (and I had to force myself to do just that, HP Book fanatic that I am), you might find yourself enjoying this movie version of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" for what it is - a fast-paced, well-made, beautiful-looking ride through Harry & co's fifth year at Hogwarts.<br /><br />The good: Acting-wise Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint keep improving, and this movie is no exception, they're very, very good in their roles. Michael Gambon is still an excellent Dumbledore and Alan RIckman's Snape is absolutely brilliant during the Occlumency scenes. It's nice to see the Dursleys back again at the start of the movie, and Harry Melling is excellent - loathsome and bullying - in his short turn as Dudley. Katie Leung is a great Cho - certainly we'll see more of her as an actress once the HP series is finished - and the rest of the cast, the heavyweights like Dame Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, David Thewlis and so forth - don't really get enough screen time to show off, but are perfectly plausible all the same.<br /><br />The newcomers are fantastic, too - Evanna Lynch makes for a great, believable Luna Lovegood and Helena Bonham-Carter's rendition of Bellatrix Lestrange is absolutely brilliant (let's hope she gets more screen-time in the ""Half Blood Prince"" adaptation!).<br /><br />But it's Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge who absolutely steals the show - she's brilliant. Turning on a dime from saccharine-sweet condescension to malevolent power-hungry bully, I can't imagine J.K. Rowling's original character being brought more wholly and satisfyingly to life. Okay, she may not look as much like a Toad as the book's character, but in the face of Staunton's excellent performance and faithful characterisation, that becomes immaterial. She's the best element of what must be the strongest set of performances in a HP movie to date.<br /><br />Direction by David Yates is superlative - this is a suitably adult-looking movie to reflect the changes in the HP characters' personalities and situations - and from the tense and frightening opening scenes, to the breathtaking and exciting close, Yates' talent and apparent love of this story is very palpable. Harry's ""dream"" sequences when Voldemort is invading his mind are brilliant - lovely to watch and very interesting from an artistic point of view - and the special effects, particularly during the closing scenes, are indescribably good.<br /><br />Production design by Stuart Craig is the absolute best in a HP movie since the original, and every element of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", Umbridge's non-toadishness notwithstanding, is nigh-on perfect. The initial scenes at the Ministry for Magic made me sit up and go ""wow!"", the death eaters and dementors are more menacing than before, there's one panoramic shot of Azkaban that makes that place absolutely terrifying in its believability. No. 12 Grimmauld Place doesn't get enough air time but what's there is gold, and the character of Grawp is a lot more human and fitting than I had imagined him from the book.<br /><br />The bad elements of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" all stem from the fact that this film's running time really is too short to capture every great aspect of the original novel, and the missing scenes will, for fans of the book, cause some distress. Also, the Malfoy-Crabbe-Goyle trinity isn't particularly worthwhile or believable, and there are a couple of montage scenes, particularly involving the Educational Decrees and Argus Filch, that feel too comic, too flimsy, to belong properly to the movie. Also, there are some overconvenient events (such as Cho and the Veritaserum, and Arthur Weasley's recovery) that could have used some rewriting to get them up to par with the rest of the screenplay.<br /><br />But that said, as a movie in its own right, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is across-the-board the most satisfying HP movie to date. Best performances, outstanding direction, excellent effects and some spectacular set and costume design have restored my faith in this series, and I for one left the cinema with a big grin on my face. Definitely a must-see for fans: newcomers; watch the others before this one - it's vital to understand what's going on. As a short adaptation of a VERY long book it works on many levels, as an entry to the movie series it's outstanding, and as a film in its own right, it's a thrilling, well-made fantasy tale that will certainly satisfy you if you don't mind the cuts.<br /><br />Highly ecommended!!"
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	The detail that made the first half of the book interesting, simply could not be supported in the film...we'd be watching until next Tuesday if that were the case!  School is out for Harry, Ron and Hermione  and things are very dark in the wizarding and the muggle world as Voldemort and the Death Eaters take over.  There is a horrible sense of foreboding and despair in this film and the tension is not so much in the action, as in the minds of our three heroes.  The actors did an excellent job of portraying three children who suddenly had to not only grow up, but also fight an evil that adults were failing to contain.<br /><br />I badly wanted the movie to keep going through to the end of the story.  My hope is that when part II comes out, the theaters run part one and two together (with an Intermission...remember those?)<br /><br />See Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in the theater, then get the DVD ... you'll appreciate a lot of the nuances that went by quickly on the big screen.  And we'll all count the days until July 15, 2011.
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	"When did Spielberg start going downhill? I'd say some time in the late 1980s. You can see signs in The Last Crusade: the stunt-casting of Sean Connery, the silly scene with Hitler, and perhaps the over-extended tank chase. Since then, I haven't enjoyed anything he's made, which is remarkable considering how wonderful his earlier films were.  We can gauge his fall by comparing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull with the earlier Indiana Jones movies.<br /><br />First, despite what the cinematographer says (in a featurette) about duplicating the look of the old films, this sequel is visually much less interesting. Do a direct comparison: the early films have tight compositions, lots of interesting movement through the frame, and dramatic high-contrast lighting. Kingdom's shots tend to be excessively wide, boringly composed, and overlit, making the image look flat and bland. I thought the absolute worst moment was the diner scene, which was awkwardly set up, mostly stuck in one long shot, and with a deep focus that brought out every detail of the busy background and was painfully distracting. You'll also notice, throughout the action scenes, not one close-up of Jones looking frightened, in pain, flustered or relieved, whereas in the early films these shots helped us empathise with the character, adding to the drama and being really a signature of the series.<br /><br />Kingdom unfortunately models its structure on recent action movies, which means action, action, action, always at the expense of character. The problem with this is that if you don't care about the characters, you don't care about the action. Also, the application of modern techniques eliminates the rough-and-ready quality of the action in the old films, which made them wonderfully believable. The use of motion-controlled cameras, the obvious CG clean-up, the flow of unbelievable stunt after unbelievable stunt, all these make action scenes look slick and fake. That we are supposed to believe a 65 year old man could do all these things (including things much more difficult than in any of the previous films) is the final dealbreaker. Probably the worst offender of the action scenes is the jungle chase, which is ten or fifteen minutes of pure fantasy, most notably Mutt continuing a sword fight for five minutes while astride two speeding jeeps. With so much silly Stuff happening during this scene, it quickly becomes a bore. It's directly followed by the army ant scene, which did have the potential to be a classic Indiana Jones moment, but was undermined by immediately following the exhausting jungle chase, and by being boringly directed. There's some running around and screaming, but our heroes hardly feature.<br /><br />The story is not bad in itself, but is spoiled by various silly things, such as: Jones walking TOWARDS the mushroom cloud of an atomic bomb; Mutt wanting to rescue some old guy for no compelling reason I could gather; Jones mispronouncing ""libary"" (though I'm sure everyone on set thought it was hilarious); cunningly evading the Russian spies by going home and staying there; Inca ninjas (totally unexplained); reintroducing Marion and then not giving her any decent scenes with Jones; a middle and last act with five potentially interesting characters (six including the villainess) and no interesting dramatic scenes at all; more ninjas; an elaborate gate-unlocking scene which was done for real but LOOKS computer generated; Jones rushing into the skull chamber when a tentative creep would've been more dramatically interesting (but hey, why start now?); the portal to other dimensions looking like a big extractor fan; the villain dissolving in a CGI haze when we all wanted to see her head explode; Jones's ""surprise son"" looking nothing like him; and the groan-inducing applause at the wedding (a moment which the film had definitely not earned).<br /><br />So what's GOOD about Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? Well, most of the actors do what they can with their underwritten parts (though I still think Cate Blanchett is overrated), and the production design, costuming, etc, are of a high standard. (John Williams' music sounded good in its featurette, but I hardly noticed it in the film.) There were a lot of good IDEAS in the story: retrieving an item from the mysterious government warehouse, the atomic test village (though it seemed to belong in a different story), the return of Marion, the South American setting. I even think the ""aliens"" plot had potential. It's just that in almost every case the execution of the idea failed to deliver.<br /><br />Let's just be thankful they won't be making any more of these."
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	There are things about this movie that were great. But then there were things about this movie that were just not so good or at least could have been much better<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />The acting: Hemsworth did exceptionally well. He was really the best thing about this entire movie. Theron did a very good job as the queen as well and the majority of the other actors (especially the dwarves) had a very good performance as well.<br /><br />CG: The special effects were great. From the phantom armies to the environment, this movie did a great job of portraying a mystical land full of danger and beauty<br /><br />Environment: Costumes and landscape were great. From the merky dungeons, to the ugly castles, to the dreary towns, dark forest, sanctuary, animals, everything about the environment was just great. They probably could have done a little more with the black forest but still, what they did do was great.<br /><br />The ok but could have been much better<br /><br />Battle Scenes: So the previews led me to believe this movie would be a braveheart style movie with a heroine and in the land of mysticism. It wasn't. There were a few battle scenes that were good but most were rather boring and no where close to epic. The very last confrontation was the best and did get you into it but every battle scene leading up to it was lack luster.<br /><br />Story: Now the story is the story that we have all heard before. So I'm not complaining about THAT story, but really they didn't do enough with it to warrant me shelling 20 bucks for me and my wife to go sit in a theater to watch it. If you are someone that just ABSOLUTELY loves the story of Snow White then maybe you probably won't care but all the glitter and glam they added to the story, still fell short of being worth it and taking it from the old old story I've grown up hearing.<br /><br />The bad<br /><br />The acting: Kristen Stewart. I'm sorry but this was either not her movie or not her performance. I liked her in adventureland. But her acting skills either weren't strong enough for this role or she just wasn't the right match. She just fell short unfortunately.<br /><br />All in all it's a decent movie worth watching. Is it worth shelling out 10 bucks a person to watch? No probably not. Is it worth a buck at redbox? Definitely. The beautiful environment and classic story are enough to bring you in but the lack of originality, boring battle scenes, and uneven acting is enough to give you pause.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	The movie adaptation was good, don't get me wrong, and most of the things from the book were included, but what covered chapters in the book only covered seconds in the movie. Like the Dursley's leaving for example. They all weren't as cold as that. Harry and Dudley ended up shaking hands. The movie didn't quite live up to the book, but they never do. If you didn't read the book, you wouldn't understand. It's still a good movie though, if a little disappointing.
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	A relative with an interest in organized crime wanted me to watch this.<br /><br />1).  You know, even the real crooks and police do not talk that way.  For example, they are able to put together three words without one of them being an obscenity.<br /><br />2).  Big name actors who are also, in their private lives, individuals with whom I would want no contact and it shows in this picture.<br /><br />3).  Contrived plot.<br /><br />To call this production a film noir or police procedural is truly an insult to the ones of that type made in the forties and fifties which are worth watching.<br /><br />Another reviewer stuck it out for twenty minutes.  I lasted fifteen.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	"DVD set arrived sealed and in new condition from The Vidiot. The DVDs were easy to follow; this exercise program is great whether you're looking to get into an exercise routine or just change up your current one. Sean T was a great instructor; he easy to follow and he was encouraging, saying things like ""Just a few more; you're doing this so you can get a hot body"" (my words not his). Each daily exercise differed and sometimes incorporated exercises from other days, but it took some getting used to. After becoming familiar with it, you're pushed to do more reps and be quicker. It's quite demanding, but definitely worth the 60 days of dedication. And it's fun.<br />Only glitch was that a couple of the bonus discs skipped around out of order (negative for manufacturer, not the seller). I think they were programmed incorrectly because it happened in multiple DVD players."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"My family and I live overseas so we did not have a chance to see this in the theater.  Normally, I am very skeptical of movie hype.  I figure, the more hype a film has, the less they deserve it.  However, this film lived up to the media frenzy.  I love the book and it is part of my family's Christmas tradition.  The film had the same rich detail and look of the book's illustrations. Of course, much was added to the film to make it feature-length.  But none of what was added would have been out-of-place in the original story.  The basic premise of ""faith in what your heart tells you is true"", shines through in the movie, and makes the most cynical of people believe in the magic of the Christmas season."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Arguing With Myself brought tears to my eyes. It takes a lot to make me laugh.  I caught one of Jeff's shows over some time ago and I would tell everyone I knew...There's this guy, this ventriloquist...jalipeno....on a stick...You just have to get this DVD.  Without Walter, Peanut, & Jose, the stand up is great, throw in the whitty crotchety old man, the multi-lingual receding hairline alien, the super-excitable red neck, the smooth jive talkin pimp daddy, and the vegetable on a stick and this show is unbeatable!!!
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	This Tv show really has it all, Sex, gore and some truly interesting characters. Just the kind of show HBO needs to bring it back into the mainstream. Anna Paquin is perfect as butter-wouldn't-melt Sookie Stackhouse (Yes that's really her name!) Sink your teeth into it! Ha Ha, I'm so funny.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I was a little hesitant to buy Insanity because I have bad knees, but am so glad I DID buy it. I do modify some of the exercises that are hard on the knees. Even with the modifications, it's a great workout and I have firmed up so much and I've only been doing it for 3  weeks.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	The plot made it interesting. Special effects was great. Never seen charlize theron so ugly! Very good makeup. But its a fantasy movie.
B000H7I6CU	3.0	b	This is an okay film but you can see the take off of Doc Hollywood, which is not a problem in my books because Doc Hollywood was a nice film.<br /><br />In Cars we have Lightning McQueen a rookie race car with an attitude who sees himself as the next best thing since sliced bread.  Not only does he know it, he advertises it too so he's not really a likable character.<br /><br />He is so sure of himself he is more than happy to speed on the on the road, in his arrogance he thinks he is above the law so he when he crashes into the Hill Billy town of Radiator Springs and ends up causing lots of damage he is not too happy to be sentenced to do community service to pay his debt to society.<br /><br />Lightning isn't a happy car and he all he wants to do is get away from Radiator Springs but that is going to be easier said than done and you are not sure if community service is going to make any difference to Lightning whose dreams are of the big city, lights fame and racing.<br /><br />There is a star studded cast of voices, and they do a pretty good job, Paul Newman is great as the wise old Doc Hudson and you can't help smiling at Ramon, voiced by Cheech of Cheech and Chong.<br /><br />All in all a nice little film like I said earlier, quirky and fun but nothing spectacular when I think of other animated movies I have seen over the years, not really worth going to the movies to see unless you are a real fan of Disney/Pixar, and I guess the big screen does it justice but personally I'd wait for it to come out on DVD.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	It was quite interesting. After watching it I was able to put it all together....just like The Sixth Sense. The same reaction....oooohhh gee that was wierd. Not a bad film. I'm glad it was on Showtime.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I'm a fan of Marvel comics, have been since I was a kid. After X-MEN, Fantastic 4, Spider Man and the Hulk flicks, I thought Iron man might be scraping the bottom of the barrel. Boy, was I wrong. I think it's one of the best, out of all the comic-book-to-big-screen releases. Dark Knight has no equal, it's probably not fair to throw that in the mix. We all know who's Number One. But this movie was great!!!!<br />This is absolutely on my short list of movies I can watch over and over, and I can't wait to do that on my PS3, surround sound and really, really big TV!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	We NEVER buy DVD's, but couldn't resist this one for a Father's Day gift. Wow!  The entire family LOVED every minute of it. It was the highlight of our summer TV viewing. I think every American should see this one. It showed the realistic formation of our country, not the fairy tale version we all learned in grade school. It is definitely a MUST SEE.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	"This is the closest to a perfect movie I have come to in a long time.  Imagination, music, great characters.  Just perfect.  The imperfections in the acting remind me of the tale of the persian carpet.  Each persian carpet has a n incorrect knot built into it, because perfection is only possible in the hand of god.  The story is filled with forgiveness and extraordinary power.  Characters who can feel pain and forgive.  Even the evil queen is filled with sorrow, longing and confusion; lonely and pathetic.  She is addicted to beauty for the sake of nothing other than to feed her addiction.  The evil in this story reminds of the satan as seen through the eyes of dervishes....Satan was so in love with god that he refused to bow before man....evil in this story is a human construct, very much understandable, if out of control.  And Snow white, well she is sublime....""you cannot have my heart"". understanding and forgiving.  resolute. "" who will be my brother""  and ""NO YOU CANNOT have my heart"" and she sheds a tear knowing that she is denying a pathetic creature a desperate need.  The music brings you to tears.  The seen with the white hart is seared in my memory for ever.  This is a perfect movie.  Perfect."
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	If you're a fan of the original Indiana Jones trilogy, save yourself the time and money and skip this disappointing sequel. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg went completely off the mark on this one losing all the essence, spirit, and fun of the previous movies.<br /><br />Instead of a solidly believable story strongly rooted in historical fact, the audience is force fed an overly elaborate and lifeless story masked in an endless series of special effects and cheesy nostalgic one liners. The Indiana Jones franchise is taken almost totally out of context here and regurgitated as an ill conceived cold war era/sci-fi version of tomb raider.<br /><br />This movie should never have been made. It was so bad, I actually got up and walked out. In over 30 years of watching movies, I have only done that once before. It's an insult to all Indiana Jones fans.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I had bought this for myself a while back and I liked it so much I had to buy one for a present for Christmas!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is a movie you should not miss. Great Acting, Great detail for the time period. An all around good story. If you like History this this is a real plus.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	If you like Jeff Dunham you will absolutely LOVE this DVD!  The DVD includes most of Jeff's most popular characters including a new one. As an added bonus this DVD includes the development of his newest character and shows how he personally hand crafts each of his dolls!  I was very impressed by his artistic talent! My husband, children and I love this DVD and have recommended it to all of our friends and family.  You will not regret purchasing this one!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"I would recommend this to anyone, He is very very funny. I especially like Achmed the suicide bomber.  He says ""Silence, I'll keel you.""  Very funny.  You get to thinking the ""puppets"" are real cause he is so good and the puppets are so ""lifelike""<br />You'll will not regret it and will share with family."
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	I ordered what was supposed to be a new copy of a tv series on dvd. However, the box was damaged and all 5 discs had scratches on them. The scratches did not allow us to watch the movie. I got my product very promptly, but didn't know about this issue for 2 months because it was a Christmas present. I would not recommend buying from this seller. If you want to take the chance on getting something that is fake but still usable, go for it. But I personally wouldn't use this seller again.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"I'll be honest: I wasn't that big a fan of Gangs of New York. The story was just not interesting at all and the only thing that saved it was the production values and the performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. The Aviator was a good movie but the main problem was that it didn't seem like a film you can watch over and over but rather something that was good whenever you watched it, whether it was recently or not. The Departed, revisiting territory seen in Goodfellas, was immediately jumped on as one of Scorsese's best. Is it, or is it just simply the best he's done in years, since possibly Casino but definately since Goodfellas? Maybe.<br /><br />The main man in the Departed is Frank Costello, a crime boss in Boston. A particularly nasty and blunt fellow and dealing with many illegal practices, the police have been after him for years. Doesn't help that he's got an informant in the police department named Colin Sullivan. The police, headed by officers Queenan and Dignam, decide they need their own informant in Costello's crew. In comes Billy Costigan, who after a stint in prison gets accepted in Costello's crew but both sides know a rat exists so both Billy and Colin have to outwit each other without actually meeting.<br /><br />When a film is mentioned as being a director's best since whatever, it always nags me since that's not always the case. With the Departed, coming after simply ok films like Aviator or Gangs and Bringing Up the Dead, it's easy to say that it's Scorsese's best since his output isn't like what we've had recently. It's an exciting movie filled with twists and turns but at the same time it seems like a movie where it feels like Scorsese's niche. In other words, he knows how to make mob movies and is good at it. The only thing is that the story seems to twist without being shocking. Certain plot points don't have as much kick as they should and at the end, one character out of the blue says his connection with Costello, it's like ""him? where the hell was he the entire movie?""<br /><br />However, the casting is great with the accompanying performances through the roof. Jack Nicholson, seen in such comedies as Something's Gotta Give and Anger Management, it's finally nice to see ""actor Jack"" back and not the superstar. And once-reviled Leonard DiCaprio proves there's more to him than just a handsome face. Supporting players also work from scene stealer Mark Wahlberg to Alec Baldwin but strangely the only one I felt didn't work was one of the key ones. Matt Damon felt slightly miscast since I never got that feeling that this guy was corrupt and misleading. When he starts swearing a lot near the end or being kind of a jerk to love interest Vera Farmiga's character, it just seems...off. Of course it's probably just me.<br /><br />It's too bad that the DVD cover is so classy when the special features seem light. Yeah the Scorsese documentary is long and informative but there just doesn't seem to be enough features for this to be the definitive Departed DVD. Even the Aviator was more packed than this. The exclusion of a Scorsese commentary is one thing but an extensive making-of about the filming is kind of inexcusable. Look for an eventual double-dip in the near future.<br /><br />I will admit that the Departed was a lot of fun and I'd recommend it to buy but this is a career highlight that hasn't had one in almost 20 years."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Before I had my son I loved going to the gym and pushing myself as hard as I could on the bike, step machine, and treadmill.<br /><br />This set of videos pushes you hard, makes you sweat, and leaves you aching. I love it! I have only been doing it a week and I am already seeing and feeling results. I'm back to a 26 inch waist and my thighs aren't quite as jiggly! Love, love, love it!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	this is the best ventroliquist i have ever seen. the comedy is side splitting funny.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Movies like Iron Man restore even the most bitter critic's faith in Hollywood. This movie is the way films should be - entertaining, yet though-provoking; exciting yet educational; realistic, yet futuristic; and more importantly, well acted, well directed, and well written. Its main characters self-prophecies to have flaws, but this movie hardly has any. With superb special effects, amazing gadgets, and stunning visual effects - this movie was meant to be seen in Blu-Ray.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This was great. Much better than the TV version. Jeff is the best comedian ever
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	As you probably know, Jeff Dunham is a ventriloquist who appears on Comedy Central a lot. Apparently he has his own show now, but I haven't seen it. His comedy is not politically correct, but he's an equal-opportunity offender. He's topical and he's very, very funny.<br /><br />The characters who worked on this show with him include:<br /><br />Walter, an old curmudgeon with a face like a prune.<br />Sweet Daddy D, introduced as his new manager.<br />Bubba J, a beer swilling NASCAR fan.<br />Peanut, who is something alien, I think.<br />Jose Jalapeno in a stick. Yes, a jalapeno pepper in a Mexican hat. On a stick.<br /><br />So long as you're not easily offended, I think you will love this show.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"I liked this movie. I didn't watch the theatrical version but rather the extended version and thought it was very good. I have read reviews that said Kristin Stewart was horrible, and that Chris Hemsworth wasn't much better. Although not a Stewart fan for many reasons, I thought her portrayal of her character was very well done. Except for riding to battle in armor in which she looked cold and uncomfortable (and who wouldn't under the same circumstances) She came across as very believable to me. Watching the bonus features, I learned that she is NOT a horsewoman, so her acting in that very brief scene was also understandable. I also thought Mr. Hemsworth's acting was right on point for his character. In all, I really liked this movie. The other actors were well done, and believable, except perhaps for the brother, and even the Queen. I find characters who are so evil a bit hard to take, but then, that is just my personal opinion. The acting was well done in all cases.<br />Now, on to the movie itself.  I don't care for dark movies:  meaning, scenes done in pitch black lighting. I can't see anything! Why directors feel the need to make things completely dark, so that only in a movie theatre can they be seen is short sighted. Even at night with all the lights out, there are many details totally lost to the viewer due to this fact. Also, and this may be due to my age, I really wish that moviemakers would take into account that ""background"" music and noise should be just that: IN THE BACKGROUND!!! Most movies these days feel that emotional music scores and sounds not related to actual actors speaking should be louder than the actual dialog. WRONG! If I can't hear the actors lines, how am I to understand what is going on? In some of the bonus features, I actually HEARD the lines missed in the movie because sound was not a major distraction in those interviews.<br />So, except for some major problems with filmmakers, which has nothing to do with this movie specifically, this is a great movie to watch for general entertainment value. And that, for me, is the reason I watch movies: Entertainment. I don't watch to be `preached' to about social issues, or for the most part, to learn about history (although sometimes that is a benefit, since I realize movies that have historical background are usually full of inaccuracies, which I am also aware of, so that doesn't bother me).<br />All in all, I would definitely recommend this move to others. It is great fun and well acted, in my opinion."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	I love this movie--have seen it maybe 15 times already. Time to buy it!It is full of philosophy and action. It is never boring. The film noir style works perfectly for this genre (graphic novel) and the quality of acting, directing and writing is evident. There is also plenty of eye-candy for boys and girls alike. It is intensely creative. It is also extremely violent and perverse--not for the very young or those unused to extreme violence. I recently saw The Spirit, another film by Frank Miller and it cannot compare to Sin City. It is the very best of the genre.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	If you like the whacky humor that can be had with a ventrilopuist, then you will LOVE Jeff Dunham.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	This film is bound to stir up some admiration from lovers of postmodern narratives and controversy from lovers of classic noir and/or western narratives because its gruff white narrator played by Tommy Lee Jones, consciously or no, begs the viewer to meditate on the veracity of all white narratives of the west where the good are usually the determined and god and nature favored white man and the bad are almost always some sin-stained other. Here that other is a Mexican sociopath,a kind of demon conjured out of the guilty conscience of the white ruler-creator, but the white ruler-creator is past his prime and his myths of the world are fading, have faded, from the scene and all that is left is sound and fury (and some signature Coen Brothers tenebrific humor).<br /><br />It would seem that the Coen Brothers are interested in revisioning or deconstructing the American mythos of the west as a kind of no man's land where men (white men) do battle with their own metaphysical demons/narratives. The problem is not that the sheriff of this no man's land is not a law and order man because he is that, but that hes a law and order man who thinks too much and does too little. Whats baffling and fascinating and frustrating about the film is that the gruff sheriff is just not all that interested in catching up with the villain anymore; he's just too fixated on his own conscience, and his own inability to pass judgment of any kind on any one; he knows his time, his people's time, has passed. He (instinctively, if not consciously) knows the time for white narratives/myths has passed. And a sheriff contemplating the end of his line is not a very effective enforcer of the public good. He's impotent like those wanderers in the desert of modern poetry...his only friend the end. His constant companion, his only companion, is his own mortality and the mortality of his forefathers. In an earlier generation the sherrif went out with a bang, but now he and his father just whimper on.<br /><br />Like the sheriff in Touch of Evil, Tommy Lee Jones instantly understands everything he sees(noir fanatics will love this sherrif), but unlike that earlier noir sheriff Tommy Lee Jones just can't muster up the courage to act. He wants very much for there to be some Ur-father or God administering some kind of metaphysical justice, but all he experiences is the absence of any such figure to grant authority to his law and his narratives, and thats what haunts his nightmare visions, a lack. And while the sheriff waxes metaphysical-existential-nihilistic-fatalistic there's no one to look out for the white man's or anyone's best interest.<br /><br />Its not that white people come off as the good guys here, they don't. In fact theres plenty of white men implicated in every crime. McCarthy and the Coen Brothers are careful not to portray whites as any better than the rest of humanity but what sets the whites apart is that they seem to be haunted by a nostalgia for a time when it was easier to believe in their own ability to shape myths about the land and myths about their own innate Godliness/goodness. By the time Tommy Lee Jones' generation arrives that time has long since passed away. The film is a lament for the death of white heroes/narrative(s). We root for Brolin, but we know he's doomed. Tommy Lee Jones attempts to conjure the mythic past to give him strength to endure (classic Faulkner and McCarthy stuff) but even his dreams are of waste lands populated only by desert riders.<br /><br />If we still believed in white mens prophecies we might be tempted into believing that the escape of badman Bardem into the light of August is meant to be prophetic, but its just blind chance, random and bland, running the show from here on.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	This documentary is a real eye opener.  It is informative, shocking, and riveting.<br /><br />Although some think that this is about promoting intelligent design theory or creationism, that is not the case at all.  It is really about exposing a repressive academic environment that is more about political correctness and maintaining the status quo than it is about seeking the truth.<br /><br />The 'science' community in academia and elsewhere has become a big kool-aid drinking cult on the issue of Darwinism.  The filmmaker, Ben Stein, does a superb job of showing how universities and other organizations have retaliated against those who do not follow the party line.  He documents how they have been denied tenure, fired, had research money cutoff, etc. when they have dared to raise questions or take an unpopular position.  He also names names.<br /><br />This should be watched by everyone who is interested in academic freedom and the search for truth.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	People would've liked this a lot better if they didn't know Shyamalan had made it.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This is one of the best movies to showcase HD capabilities.  I popped this in the Playstation 3, on a 61 inch Samsung DLP with a Denon soundbar and it was amazing.  The Iron Man suit looks like it is standing right in front of you.  I didn't know the suit had so much detail and movement until I watched it at home.  It looks better at home than it did in the theater.  The sound is superb.  You must watch this with the audio turned way up.  You can hear every blast and jet propulsion sound coming from the suit when Iron Man is flying.  My favorite visual and audio part is when Iron Man is flying in the sky and the 2 jets are chasing him.  Turn the volume way up and hear the surround sound go from one side of the room to the other as Iron Man and the jets fly by.  I love it.  Simply amazing.  One of the better movies in Blu Ray.<br /><br />All the special features, BD live plus a digital copy to watch on your iPhone/iPod makes this a great deal!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	American history has never been so easy -- or so enjoyable.  We particularly appreciated the pop-up text boxes in the Blu-Ray version, which provided snippets of history that deepened our understanding of what we were watching.  Bravo, HBO!
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	This was a great movie at a great price. I also have the six CD set and I enjoyed watching a couple of the previous movies before watching this one.<br />For the most part, I don't believe the movies can do the books justice - but this one came close. I pre-ordered the movie, and as usual, Amazon delivered quickly and at a good price.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	When people ask me wha my favorite movie is I always say it's more about directors rather that actual titles. Martin Scorcesse never lets me down in that department. This year he graces the movie going public with yet another exciting and all out fun shoot'em up twisted up masterpiece in 'The Departed'<br /><br />How can you say anything bad about this movie? I had spoken to about 20-35 different people who had seen this movie in the theaters and not once did I hear a single negative word towards it. The cast couldn't get any better, this is the best cast Scorcesse put together since Goodfellas. Matt Damon Boston native extrodiare and Leo DiCaprio put on probably their best performances of their careers and each were in two very well put together movies on their own this same year. I was shocked that neither got a nomination for best actor for this movie. Eventhough DiCaprio got a nomination for Blood Diamond it was a stll a shock. The great Jack never lets you down with his intimidating on screen presence and his signature wit and classic quotables. Probably the best performace in this movie was Mark Walberg. He was a power house and really knew how to do that Bostonian accent to a tee.<br /><br />All and all if you are a fan of great mob movies its your movie. If you are into big casts its your movie. If you are into artsy films that can possibly win best picture of the year...oh wait too late, it is  winner for you. This is one of those movies you will probably watch a million times and finally credit was given where credit was sorely due.
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"In this movie, Scott explores again the theme of creator versus creation. However, it is maddeningly incomplete - sometimes purposefully, I hope. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br /><br />A pale-skinned ""god"" sacrifices himself to seed a planet - ours? - with his DNA. Why is his dramatic death necessary? How about a blood extraction? It appears to be ritualistic and gratuitous. Perhaps it speaks to the theme of God's self-sacrifice in Christianity, and is meant to be a basis (racial memory, etc.) for such elements in religion.<br /><br />So, the team takes off in a Weyland ship to meet their makers. On the journey, we are entertained by watching David, the android, who passes time shooting hoops, watching movies, and eavesdropping on his co-passengers' dreams. Rapace's Shaw remembers her father, who passes on to her his reasons for belief - ""choosing to believe"" - which Shaw echoes.<br /><br />On the one hand, this sounds maddeningly unscientific, which is Scott's intent. However, as recent philosophers and historians of science have come to agree, Shaw's answer is actually the only basis for believing science can tell us anything - faith in a rational God who is consistent (due to his promises) is the underlying foundation of modern knowledge. As Nancey Pearcey summarizes for us in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0891077669"">The Soul of Science: Christian Faith and Natural Philosophy (Turning Point Christian Worldview Series)</a> Rejection of this foundation has left the sciences (and even math) in deep confusion, although we see the external shell continuing to operate.<br /><br />Also, in our real world, many scientists or agnostics have embraced ""faith"" due to what they have discovered in science (e.g. Allen Sandage). But that's another story. I doubt that Scott, whose ""1492"" was filled with historical gaffes (no one during Columbus's time thought the world was flat), was even aware of these points.<br /><br />Things start to not make sense. Finding that the air is breathable, they remove their helmets. That's right. Who needs to worry about infectious agents in an alien world? Then two scientists, including the one who mapped the alien structure/ship they find, get lost. Later, one of them tries to pet a hitherto unknown alien life form, with bad results.<br /><br />Some of the crew are dismissive of David, almost rude and contemptuous. This behavior is hard to believe, unless we accept this as objective, scientific callousness (they know David has no feelings - or does he?), but is needed for a creepy plot point where, in conversation with David, one of them essentially approves his own demise. It's a very effective and squirmworthy scene.<br /><br />In another scene, the captain opens the door to an unexpected visitor. Right. Chaos ensues. In a way, it's all rather silly, if you think about it.<br /><br />There are questions. Is Vickers an android as well? Or is she Weyland's daughter? Weyland says David is the closest he'll have to a son, and Vickers looks pained. Some think this means she's really human (along with the fact that she has sex with humans). Yet later she slams super-strong David against a wall to get him to divulge something. Is this super-strength or is David merely humoring her? (The fact that she calls Weyland ""Father"" means nothing. Androids tend to become unpredictable in the movies, and David is no exception, either.)<br /><br />Also, why do the Engineers want to destroy us? Are we a threat? There is a phrase in the movie to the effect that ""sometimes to create you first have to destroy."" Likewise, Vickers is waiting for Weyland to die so she can take over (""A king dies ..."") and David seems to want his creators dead (""Doesn't everyone ...?"") Do the Engineers want to start over? Or is it just a necessary step in their whole scheme of things? Is something else going to take over from us?<br /><br />Or ... are we their creators? Wow.<br /><br />Why does the awakened Engineer go beserk? What did David say to him? A great scene underscoring the importance of android-thought-process monitoring, but somewhat abrupt.<br /><br />And why are there still other ships and Engineers on the planet, after 2,000 years? Are they on Union rules? (Note: this seems to be a different planet than the one in Aliens.)<br /><br />So many questions, hopefully to be answered in a sequel, where Scott can really jump the shark. A real fear, if you know what his ""twist"" in Blade Runner (regarding Tyrell) was supposed to be, thankfully averted.<br /><br />Note, though, the movie's tie-ins to ""In the Mountains of Madness"". I don't know how much Scott sticks to that plot, but it may explain most everything.<br /><br />The CGI is mostly great, except for the Engineer's death at the start (looks a little cartoonish). But otherwise the visuals are sci-fi wonderful. The monolithic spaceship hovering over the barren planet. The Prometheus, the Porsche to the Nostromo's Tonka. The Engineers. The Engineer seated in his slithering seat. The falling of the alien ship. (Too bad the cause was telegraphed in the trailers - I would have liked that to be a surprise.) The color palettes and production design demand to be seen over and over again. And I can't wait to see this on a 3D TV.<br /><br />The score evokes a theme or two from Blade Runner, appropriately.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's a little confused or confusing. The people don't behave logically, and some plot points don't make sense. But any fan of Blade Runner and sci fi will enjoy it nevertheless. Fassbender's David is spellbinding, and is reason alone to enjoy this movie."
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"Oho! I knew it was only a matter of time before Kristen Stewart and I would cross paths. I've avoided the Twilight saga like the cooties, and so I've missed out on the fuss and the furor about her. But I couldn't pass up on SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN like I passed up on MIRROR MIRROR, and, it turns out, I sort of fancy Stewart's performance. Skin white as snow, lips red as roses, hair black as a raven's wing. That fleshes out Kristen Stewart to a tee. Still, it's nigh impossible to trump Charlize Theron's turn as Snow White's rather... self-absorbed... step-mother. Theron simply mesmerizes. She's so good there are moments you sympathize with her - that poor, gorgeous, demented queen who as a girl was cursed by a mother's dark gift. Evil begets evil, and you sense that Ravenna must have endured some unspeakable sh--. Not that that makes up for her nasty practice of sucking the beauty and vitality out of innocent girls... Queen Ravenna is like the grim fairy tale version of Project Runway.<br /><br />It's a darker iteration, grittier, moodier, more full-blooded. I think the Brothers Grimm would've approved of this interpretation; it matches their gristly sensibilities more. If you've brushed up on the fairy tale, then you know the kernel of the story. SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN tweaks and embellishes on that. When the vain and vile but oh-so-beautiful witch Ravenna (Theron) murders her husband, the king, on their wedding night, it upends the kingdom, sinks it into a realm of despair and oppression. We also learn that this is only the most recent in a long series of regicides that Ravenna has committed. The king had one young daughter, Snow White, lovely and bright and pure, whom Ravenna promptly sentences to incarceration in the castle dungeons. For years Snow White languishes in wretched confinement.<br /><br />I don't know how I feel about how the magic mirror is presented, the film granting it the ability to metamorphose, liquid metal like, into a faceless, flowing figure that stands before Ravenna whenever she extends that one familiar question. I get that they were trying to change it up with the mirror, but then they forgot the follow-thru. so, the mirror can assume a form. And then what? And then nothing.<br /><br />In the story I read ages ago, the huntsman takes Snow White into the woods, at the Queen's behest, and in the woods the huntsman was tasked with carving out Snow White's lungs and liver (if I remember it right) as proof of her demise. But the huntsman demonstrates mercy and allows Snow White to flee. He instead presents to the queen the lungs and liver of a boar, and so the queen comes to believe that Snow White was indeed deaders. And so the huntsman exits the tale. But you only have to glance at the film's title to get a whiff that the huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), this time out, lands a meatier role, sticks around a bit longer.<br /><br />Another fashion in which this film veers away from the fairy tale we know (**coughDisneyAnimatedFilmcough**): I like that there's only a smidgen of romance, but I like that the smidge that IS there is crucial to the plot. Not to get all Twilighty, but the story does force you to choose a camp to follow: that of the surly, drunken huntsman What'shisface or Snow White's childhood pal and the Duke's dashing son, William (Sam Claflin). Note that William is a bowman who seems to rival the Avengers' Hawkeye in uncanny marksmanship. Meanwhile, I think Chris Hemsworth exhibits solid acting chops, lending tortured depth and melancholia to his huntsman. He takes a Scottish accent out for a spin, and I'm gullible enough or listened to James Doohan enough to be convinced by it. But the trailers to ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER put Hemsworth's axe-work to shame.<br /><br />SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN flaunts a secret weapon, or rather, eight secret weapons, in the shapes of dwarves. It kinda sucks for actual dwarf actors out there, because the film employs normal-height actors who then were CG'd down to Gimli-size. But, then again, Peter Dinklage is damn busy nowadays. These contentious dwarves - as played by the likes of Ian McShane, Ray Winstone, and Nick Frost - end up stealing many scenes.<br /><br />It's a stunning-looking movie, or to quote my date: ""Ohhh, so pretty!"" Rupert Sanders, after a career of helming snazzy advertisements, makes his debut as a feature film director. He brings along that same eye for spectacular visuals. He lends a spooky and foreboding atmosphere to the twisted Black Forest, and it marks Snow White's abject desperation that she elects to seek dubious sanctuary within its sickly boughs. When tree branches make it a habit to transform into serpents, I tend to wonder where I left my chainsaw (sorry, tree huggers). Conversely, Sanders' depiction of the fairyland is pretty damn wondrous and speaks to that inner child still in you (yes, even you). The narrative further expands to allow for Snow's encounter (or yell-off) with a bridge troll, and, later, with a tribe of females that had committed self-mutilation rather than face the Queen's attention. The film's final action flourish consists of the almost requisite epic battle. I've gotta credit Kristen Stewart. She does have presence and she does have charisma. Or maybe those eyes suckered me in. She rolls off that hokey rousing rally speech and just about pulls it off, and that with a British accent (that, okay, occasionally strays). Still, maybe my favorite bit - and I realize I kind of pooh-poohed the romantic angle earlier - concerns the kiss that galvanizes the poisoned princess. I saw it coming, I'm sure you'll see it coming, but it was still a very strong scene. An ""Oh, yeah!"" kinda scene. Crap, there goes my mushy side. Great. Now even my date is telling me to man up.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Option to view the film in either the Theatrical version (02:07:12 hours) or the Extended Edition (02:11:30 hours)<br />- Audio Commentary by director Rupert Sanders, visual effects supervisor Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, and co-editor Neil Smith<br />- ""A New Legend is Born: Director's Vision Comes to Life"" - behind-the-scenes featurette that explores various elements of the film such as the incredible art design, the stunts, the locations, the special effects, etc. (00:20:53 minutes)"
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	Well done and very entertaining. Good acting and great action levels. Congratulations to them for keping it tastefull not overdoing gory violence scenes.
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	Good movie on all levels, but still a leftwing view of the U.S. military, and in that sense disappointing. Very uncreative, politically.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	I enjoyed this movie for the sake of what they were trying to do with technology.  However I can't help but think that I would have like this as live-action, not the way is was done, but I suppose cost was the driving factor.<br /><br />Be warned, I tried playing this movie on a JVC and a Norcent player, and it could not be read.  This happened with two versions of the disc.  So maybe some players can't read it.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"I never followed Iron Man in the comics, so the idea of this character as a movie intrigued me.  The story and character build is one that keeps the viewer interested quite apart from any ""superhero"" quality.  It is not as far fetched as the imagination would recommend rather quite feasible in technoloy although some of the action takes it further than a rational story.  actors/actresses are well cast for the most part."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Got this movie last Christmas since my parents and I have to purchase new cars last June.  I decided that I should have this movie too which reminded of last June.  To all NASCAR fans it is also perfect since it begins with auto racing.  Movie also had a bit education which talked about US 66 out west from the past to present.  Movie was also scenic which took out on a scenic drive through the desert, the forest, and river.  Bonuses were also interesting too which feature real pictures of the old cars of the past including the Hudson Hornet.  Here I had a bit of fun watching this movie since it reminded of a vacation.  Therefore for families and children this would a perfect roadtrip during the cold winter.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	It was a good movie but I think they could have done more with it.  The action should have been more I think and the story line could have been more in-depth.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I bought these movies for my children.  It is a great movie.  This particular Christian movie has action and emotion and is not the typical Christian movie.  I would recommend it to ANYONE.
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	"I may not be ""the guy"" to review this flick because frankly, I'm not a Marvel comic junky. When I reach into my holster for comic-to-cinema, I only come up with Spidey Part Deaux and Batman Begins...so there you have it.<br /><br />Do I love RDJ? Yesssssssss! Jeff Bridges, too for that matter. Still, I didn't get the smarmy fun out of this movie I was hoping for based on the pre-release hype. Certainly watchable even for the non-die-hards, I just can't find myself gushing over it as I hoped I would."
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	Look, we all knew it was unlikely to be better than those that came before it, but my GOD! This film was bad beyond all expectations! We're talking POD-RACE levels of stupidity. It's troubling and sad to see characters we grew up loving and caring about being manipulated and tortured in the hands of their insane creators. Look at the stunts in the recent Batman film. Look good, eh? I don't understand why Lucas & co. insist on not getting their hands dirty and CGI-ing this film beyond all recognition.<br /><br />I'll be honest. At the start of the movie, CGI aside, it didn't seem THAT bad. I thought maybe there was a chance it was going to work out. Without giving spoilers, I can tell you that as soon as Indy and the gang hit the jungle things went terribly, terribly wrong. We have Shia swinging like tarzan from vines followed by an army of CGI monkeys and Marion defying all her natural maternal instincts by DRIVING THE JEEP CARRYING HERSELF AND HER SON NOT TO MENTION INDY OVER A FRIGGING CLIFF!!!!!!  INTENTIONALLY!!!!!!!<br /><br />Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. There was no coming back from that for me. My brain turned to jelly as, much like the Star Wars prequels before it, the Indy show looked more like a video game than a film. I suppose there are plenty of gamer types out there who might enjoy this thing. Me? I'm interested in cinema, not all this baggage, so I have now severed my connection to anything with LucasArts seal of approval stamped on it. At least we can watch the old Indy films without a hassle. Try doing that with Star Wars, at least on a big screen tv. I better not go there.<br /><br />Am I the only one who smells the Indy/Star Wars crossover potential? Was not a giant door kicked open toward the end of this film that will now allow Lucas and his sick imagination to run wild, culminating in the dreaded Han Solo/Indiana Jones handshake?<br /><br />In summary - new Indy stinks. Terrible film making. Good effort from the actors, but the people behind the camera have apparently lost their sanity. Do what I do, and what I did for the Star Wars prequels - pretend it never happened. Let Indy and his daddy ride off into the sunset at the end of Indy III, a fitting and classy ending to a wonderfully entertaining franchise.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham has some of the funniest material that I have seen in a long time, I just wish he had more offerings.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	If you haven't seen this movie yet then buy it today! The storyline is great for all ages and can be enjoyed by both the young and old. Randy Newman does a great job with the soundtrack along with Rascal Flatts, Brad Paisley, Sheyrl Crow, and John Mayer. I would definately recommend it to everyone.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I got this in great condition and I am hooked from the first episode!! I also saved 20 bucks!!!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"I bought this movie because a friend of mine was in it, and everyone I know that saw it begged me to watch it, so I reluctantly did because it was 2.5 hours long. I didn't even notice how long it was because I was so drawn in right up until the last minute, and that almost never happens (Lord of the Rings: Return of the King?). People love to nitpick and say ""it wasn't original"", but every movie at this point is going to be moderately similar to something else. I don't know what they expect. It's a fantastic movie, and definitely deserves a spot on your shelf."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	It's been a long time since I've laughed so hard. You know the kinda laugh where you can't breathe, tears are rolling down your face, your belly  is aching. I first saw Jeff Dunham on Comedy Central and just had to see the whole video.  If you've seen him there, don't think you've seen the video, there are a lot of good things that they cut out on Comedy Central so they can fit it in the time slot with commercials. It's well worth getting the video. Jeff is so good that you forget that he's the one making the voices for all the puppets. And don't miss the out takes, first listen to the commentary on them so you know what's going on, then watch without it, it's hysterical!
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Shipping was fast and the item was recieved in excellent condition! My boys love this movie!
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	I've been a big fan of the Alien franchise for over 30 years, & can't express my disappointment enough with Prometheus. I can't believe that the creator of the original Alien would screw over the franchise like this. When John Carpenter prequeled The Thing last year, he tied it together to the original perfectly. Ridley Scott surprisingly was as far off base as one can get with his prequel to his original Alien. Gone are the face-huggers which have been the staple of the entire Alien franchise, & now replaced with the kraken, snakes, & a deadly virus!? WTF! Gaping holes are left between this & the original as Prometheus plays out, with the debacle finally concluding with an ending that could not possibly be any worse. The only consolation is the visual perfection that is present in all of Ridley's films.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"This film is absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end. The ""beginning of time"" montage that starts the film is beautiful; roaming shots of the Icelandic countryside and angry waterfalls wash over you as the score tries to soothe you in a way that feels like it's trying to mislead you. It's as if it's trying to say, ""There there, it'll be alright,"" and pats you softly on the hand like a caring grandmother before turning around in the next scene and growing to its peak as something horrific takes place on screen that wasn't expected mere moments ago.<br /><br />Everything is awe-inspiring to look at. One of the reasons for that is that Scott tried to use as little CGI in the film as possible (although there are over 1300 digital VFX shots) and mostly stuck to computer generated shots being used in space. If you're not blown away by the scenery, their exploration of the planet's surface and what that leads to, or the incredible shots in space, the technology they use in the film is beyond astounding; Reacting with holograms, 3D maps that can be accessed with the swipe of a finger, and an android capable of doing things some people only dream of is only scratching the surface.<br /><br />Where do we come from? Who are our makers? Will we still trust our faith when we find the answers? These are the questions ""Prometheus"" explores in its story. You also have a pretty great idea of just what the heck a Space Jockey is by the time ""Prometheus"" ends. The thing is that if you go into this expecting a straight shooting ""Alien"" prequel, you'll more than likely be disappointed. There are definitely nods to it and parts of the film play out similarly to ""Alien,"" but this is more like taking place in the same universe as ""Alien"" and more of an indirect prequel. That quote Ridley Scott gave about this ""having 'Alien' DNA,"" is extremely accurate.<br /><br />""Prometheus"" isn't perfect. It may be really slow moving for some. It takes its sweet time establishing its atmosphere and you may be left wanting a bit more action. Patient viewers who can sit still and admire dialogue and a solid story will be rewarded while trigger happy viewers will more than likely get antsy. The ending, although somewhat satisfying, is mostly just this huge tease. If a sequel isn't made, we should probably riot; although, with repeat viewings, it's less of a problem.<br /><br />The biggest issue people may have is that technology seems so much more advanced in the past than in the future. ""Prometheus"" mostly takes place in 2093 while ""Alien"" takes place in 2122. You also have to keep in mind that the Prometheus is a more advanced ship than the Nostromo, a towing vessel; more of a grunt ship. So the argument could go either way.<br /><br />Repeat viewings also leave you with more questions. The main one being why did the atmosphere have such an altering affect on the ampule room yet didn't affect the cargo hold at all?<br /><br />""Prometheus"" is really freaking superb on one hand. Its cast is ridiculous and every one of them delivers, the visuals are fantastic, and the storyline is mostly incredibly enthralling. Imagine being a film critic who's used to taking notes throughout the duration of a film, but during ""Prometheus"" you were so absorbed in it that you didn't write anything down other than the title. That's kind of a big deal.<br /><br />On the other hand, something more definitive seems like it would have been more gratifying. With stakes so high that define what we, as humans, actually are, an open ending leaving room for a sequel feels like a bit of a cop out. ""Prometheus"" is still spectacular and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott is back in top form, but ""Prometheus"" suffers from pulling (and relying on) the strings of anticipation a bit too much."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	GO TO christianfilms.com and click on creation series. If you can afford it, there's your information as to why we are against evolution. Only the bold would dare. And if you do so happen to order anything the best one to watch first would be lies in the textbooks. I recomend this series to all those who love GOD as well. But no one couldve put it better than Dr. Kent Hovind. GO AHEAD...DONT BE SCARED!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I bought this for my grandchildren but found it quite interesting myself. I especially liked the documentary containing information about the people behind the voices. Amazon's service was excellent.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	The extras are kind of interesting but this could be the best movie of the 5 right now what can i say.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	A lot hasn't changed in 20 years.<br /><br />Indiana (Dr. Henry) Jones is still a professor in his day job, a swashbuckling, whip-toting, fist-flying finder of thingies on his side job as Archeologist Extraordinaire. Of course, this isn't really how archeology is pursued; but who cares?<br /><br />We find Indy at the start of this rendition in the trunk of a car, being made off with by the Evil Commie Russians during the Cold War of 1957 (come on, those of you of Russian descent; it's only a very, very hokey movie, operating from the mindset of the 50s). He has expertise their Fearless Leader wants to utilize(Fearless Leader: Commander Spalko - Cate Blanchett, in a throwaway role). She is after artifacts that exhibit mind control (jeez, where have we heard this plot before?). In the dry expanses of the Nevada desert, she has located the warehouse where all artifacts with intrinsic occult properties are taken to languish by the United States government, and she thinks Indy can help her decipher one of the most powerful ones.<br /><br />Plot gets in the way, however, and Indy escapes. Further along, still pursued by the bad guys, he meets up with Mutt, a young man who also is pursuing him for his own ends; Mutt's mother has been kidnapped in South America, and she has noted Indy as being her most likely savior, without explanation to her equally swashbuckling - but lacking in experience - son. He has tracked down our intrepid aging hero to aid in the freeing of said Mom.<br /><br />What follows is an almost nonending series of fights, flights, encounters, escapes, and pursuits, in true Indy fashion, over desert terrain, narrow mountain passes, and thundering, high waterfalls and rapids. There is nothing you might not expect; some pretty good special effects; and some crystal skulls that Mr Spielberg would have us believe point directly to the early intervention of beings from another world, who came here long ago for unexplained purposes, and who seem to want to impart some of their wisdom to us - but in a way that probably is not recommended for anybody.<br /><br />This was a movie primarily for those of us who have fond memories of Indy and his exploits (I must admit to being a fan of #1 and #3, but really, really grossed out at #2). It may seem a bit tired for a new generation, but darn, it's good to see Indy looking so fit at, what? 60? 65? Good to see Karen Allen too; she doesn't really seem all that much older. Cate Blanchett must have been free from filming for an uncomfortably long stretch; this movie seems out of her league. References to Rocky and Bullwinkle have been noted, and they are not too far off. I'm sure she'll rebound with a movie better suited to her talents next time.<br /><br />Also present, very briefly, was Jim Broadbent, a great British actor, and John Hurt, in another one of his quirky character roles, basically walking through his part virtually voiceless until the end. I miss that voice. His part was fairly limited but he did all right with what he had. Shia Labouef, as Mutt, was an interesting addition, and a bit at the end hints that he might pick up the torch and carry on as Indy's successor. I really can't see Indy doing another one. I'm there too, and at some point the bones put an embargo on further derring-do, but who knows? Anything is possible.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good couple of hours, and those of us who count Indy as part of our collective journey through life will want to include it in our libraries. Somewhat dated, but eminently watchable.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	This was by far the worst harry potter movie. It felt mediocre and really dumb and I hope people get this.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This is the best movie that was made this year. HAs a great cast. It is not just one movie, more like 3 stories in one. Bruce willis is as always a tough badass. Mickey Rourke made his come back. He did a great job playing Marv. A criminal who is in love with Goldie who was killed, therefore he tries to find who killed her. Bruce willis is an old cop who tries to save a young girl. Even after many years when this girl was in danger, he still tries to help her out. Clive owen is the next big thing. He did a great job. He tries to help a waitress and goes after a guy who was bothering her. the guy will end up dying, but it is found that he is a cop and many problems bagin from then onwards. All the three stories are well done and unite at one point, because it s a Sin City and all the crazy things are happening there. Totally would suggest to every one to go and check it out!!!
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	I was interested in this movie because I liked the idea and was open to the story. The beginning was good, but then it just dragged as soon as the Kristin Stewart part strengthened. The Dwarfs were great and there were parts when Kristin was good, but I wondered when she cried how they got that effect. Her range of emotion is so limited. The Chris Hemsworth character was also limited and almost appeared to be a caricature.<br /><br />I believe that some of the blame should be with the director who seemed to be more focused on Kristen than on making a good movie. Thank goodness Charlize was in it! She was so believably evil and acted so well. She was just great. Most of the special effects were also centered on Charlize and where good. But the story was just predictable and where it could have been interesting in the relationship of the characters, it just was boring. The only good parts were the scenes when Charlize was doing her evil bit and trying to kill snow white.<br /><br />A disappointment and waste of time!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This movie was top of the line.I wacthed it on bluray and it smoked the Darknight!!!!!!  I wacthed 3 times in 2 weeks.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	This was my first Blu-ray movie. I bought it because I read it was one of the best showcases of the technology and damn were they right! The digital transfer is top-notch, the picture is crystal clear and the sound is great (too bad I don't own a FullHD set nor a sound system that supports uncompressed sound signals).I must add that unlike 'Ratatouille' the movie plays just fine in an European Blu-ray disc player (I'm from Europe).<br />The bad? The product info is wrong, this edition doesn't feature French nor Spanish subtitles, so Amazon should update the product specs. It must've been a last minute decision as the distributor had to include an additional cardboard insert (over the original cover) with updated technical info that does reflect the lack of these features.<br />Must buy!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	My son showed me Jeff Dunham and after seeing him, I had to have this DVD. It is way too funny. Whenever I feel kinda down, I pop it in and I am laughing and upbeat for the rest of the day. I highly recommend it. It is witty and fun. Jeff Dunham is so terribly talented. Can't wait for him to come out with new stuff.<br />CJM
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I received this is a Christmas gift and began the program this summer as a P90x/Insanity hybrid. It has been the best way to challenge my fitness level and keep me motivated. The intensity of the cardio is addicting. I feel like a good insanity workout helps my mood and my ability to control my weight, and I am over 45. I have been unable to lose weight for years, plateauing at a certain weight, though working out. Becoming more tone and muscular has allowed me to drop some sizes. So I stopped weighing myself and allowed myself to be satified with my size. My clothes fit comfortably and I feel GREAT. HOWEVER, I just got back from the doctor's office and after doing these workouts for a few weeks (I am in the second section- harder, longer workouts) I have actually dropped a few pounds. Those of you women over 45 (or even over 35) know what I am talking about when I say we hold weight and that scale doesn't budge. BTW- I eat a healthy diet, but I don't give up my after dinner treats- it never made a difference when I did. These workouts are flat out FAT BURNERS. Bear in mind I almost finished the whole program before I noticed the weight loss. It was definitely making me smaller and I was satisified with that. In fact, one workout can begin to make a difference and that is enough to have you trying it again the next day. I also like Sean T's style. He is not boring and he is encouraging and challenging when he coaches. If you have been working out for awhile, have done P90x, are fit and looking for your next challenge, this could be it. I look forward to these workouts everyday and I have ordered the asylum so that I will be ready for my next challenge.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I'm not saying this movie didn't have some rough scenes in it but they just didn't bother me and I'm the biggest wuss ever! I absolutely loved this movie.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and couldn't wait to see what happened next.  There hasn't been a movie of this caliber in a long time for me. I plan on buying this movie to have in my collection. Fantastic, clever, superb story. Love it!!
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"A few years have passed since we last saw him. He's a bit gray around the muzzle, and the bad guys aren't the WWII foes any more, but the Cold War Soviets. It's not clear that all the Americans are good guys either, with the commie witch-hunt in full swing and government investigations looking ever more like mafia shakedowns and intimidation. (Any commentary on current events is wholly in the mind of the reader.)<br /><br />We got past Indy's ""cute"" phase. There's a kid again, but this one's a 1950s greaser with a shiv, who'll stand against anything as long as his hair looks cool. As with Sean Connery, he's more a colleague in this adventure than sidekick. And there's the babe too. This time it's Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen - again. Indy's aged since the first movie in this franchise and so has Marion. She's a strong and handsome figure again, in more than one sense. Seeing the two actors genuinely age, as well as skipping forward in story time, adds a charm to the pair that really can't be synthesized. The reunion makes for some nice points in the plot, which I leave you to see for yourself. Oh, and Indy's hat gets a few really good scenes.<br /><br />Summer movies like this tend to be commodity entertainment, but this is a very fine commodity. The heroes stand tall, bad guys (including Cate Blanchett as the baddest of the bad) fit all the stereotypes they need to, chase scenes thrill and amuse, and the effects become increasingly grand as the story reaches its crescendo. There's lots of ineffectual gunplay and some really bad science, but the violence takes on a comic edge just before it would have turned realistically bloody. The plot wears thin enough that I had trouble avoiding spoilers, but hey - that's not why you're watching this movie. You signed up for a roller coaster ride, and you get one.<br /><br />-- wiredweird"
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	Cars is a great movie, and my son (and my whole family) continue to love the story and characters. Anyone who has not seen the movie yet, should go buy this great movie with a great story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is little on the DVD but the movie itself. This is uncommon, and leaves me feeling that there will be another release with director commentary or some other extra. I somehow feel cheated these days when I get a DVD without a director's commentary.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	We already have the regular version of Polar Express but I wanted to see how my new HD TV would handle 3D. It was fantastic. Most of the time you're right in the middle of the action...I'm kind of a Christmas nut anyhow, so it was right up my alley to watch this during one of our hotter weather periods. Well done.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	My Husband and I were really looking forward to watching this movie.  When we opened the case, the CD was broken and we could not watch it.  We were very disappointed.  Other items we have ordered from Amazon were just fine, so will continue to use them in the future.
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"The purpose of Ridley Scott's film ""Prometheus"" apparently is to explain the origin of what was found on the hostile planet by the group of space travelers in the beginning of the original film ""Alien"" (1979).  The conclusion of ""Prometheus"" may be rather ambiguous to those not have seen it and seems to be setting us up for yet another sequel.<br /><br />There are, as expected, amazing optical effects compared to the earlier ""Alien"" films, but I had difficulty in becoming emotionally involved with  the characters in ""Prometheus"" as I did not in ""Alien"" and especially in the later film ""Aliens.""  I have had the complete Alien collection for a couple of years now and  I still haven't gotten around to watching the third and fourth films in the series and possibly never will.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but I am coming to regard ""Bladerunner"" as my favorite Ridley Scott sci-fi film.  In its odd way it perhaps creates characters and a universe you can believe.  The Blu-ray release of this film is especially impressive and greatly encourages repeat viewing.  While ""Bladerunner"" cannot boast of the technical sophistication of ""Prometheus"" there is an atmospheric aspect to ""Bladerunner"" that cannot be denied that ""Prometheus"" somehow lacks."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	A fantastic comedy show.  Jeff goes on a bit too long in the beginning about his dog when all you need to know about is his car.  However, every puppet is full of laughs.  Melvin is a bit shaky, but when you watch the amazing extras (5 stars) you'll see he didn't have much prep with him.  So hopefully we'll get better jokes the next time we see him.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	John Adams: An American president whose name isn't as well known as many others. He was a 1-term president from Massachusetts, sandwiched in between two 2-term presidents from Virginia--George Washington and Thomas Jefferson--whose portraits appear on our coinage and currency. (Yes, there are still some $2 bills floating around.)<br /><br />I caught only snippets of the miniseries, but from what I saw, I knew I had to see the entire story. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are both excellent in this movie, and the more I see Paul Giamatti, the more I realize what a fine actor he is.<br /><br />John Adams was a man of conviction, honesty, trustworthiness, stubbornness, and intellect. He became very frustrated when he saw evil and ineptitude, and he was very outspoken. Perhaps some of these characteristics pushed him into the background of history and caused him to be unpopular during his lifetime, but two hundred years later, I believe that many have come to appreciate him as a great leader--a man misunderstood by too many others.<br /><br />If you missed the HBO series on TV, get the DVD. Especially if you are passionate about history as I am, you will greatly enjoy this miniseries.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"This movie was horrible.  I saw it in theaters when it first came out, thinking it might be interesting.  I remembered Win Ben Stein's money from Comedy Central, and who could forget Ferris Bueller?  Plus it was about the current science education system in the US which is something I feel is extremely important.<br /><br />First of all, I just could not get over the fact that the movie compared evolution-accepting scientists and educators to Nazis... what utter drivel.  As a biology student in my university, hopefully on my way to becoming a professor, I found this horribly offensive.<br /><br />Next I realized the movie was essentially propaganda supporting a direct injection of pseudo-science into the school system via the court system.  This is NOT HOW SCIENCE WORKS!! For more info on that, research the ""scientific method"", and the ""peer review process"".  Neither Creationism nor Intelligent Design have been able to make it through either of these necessary scientific processes.  The one and only problem with a democracy is that the masses can be easily controlled with a slick media presentation, especially one that uses scare tactics like comparing its opponents to Nazi Germany.  This movie worries me for this reason...<br /><br />The movie did make some seemingly interesting points (if they had been true) about various scientists who were fired from their jobs for doubting evolution.  Lucky I had my notebook on me, and was able to write down their names for further research later that night.  Guillermo Gonzalez and Richard Sternberg are the two names I still remember.  Turns out they weren't fired at all.  One was an astrophysicist who was only able to bring in about $200K in grants at the university he worked for (Univ of Iowa I believe) when the average for a prof there is right around 1.3 MILLION DOLLARS... thats only 15% of the average.  He tried to apply for tenure, but obviously his application wasn't accepted, due to his abysmal performance.  The movie calls this being ""denied tenure"" and acts like its some huge big deal, as if its illegal or something, when its not... its business as usual.  Tenure is reserved for the big fish... the really smart guys who the schools can't afford to get rid of.  Its not for the guys who can't manage to get a reviewed research paper published within the 7 years they work for the university... and its also not for the Professors who don't even manage to pass one graduate student during their career.<br /><br />The other name I'm able to remember, Richard Sternberg, had a similarly false story.  There were 6 or 8 of them in all, and if you do a google search for ""Expelled Exposed"" there is a pretty good resource there to find out more about ridiculously-over-exaggerated claims in the movie.  Several of the people who claimed they were ""expelled"" or fired from there teaching and research positions because of their views seemed to be bending the truth a bit, to the point that they damn near broke it in half.  Most of them were simply not great professors (or they were lowly research assistants) whose contracts ran out, and who the university saw no reason to re-hire... once again, this is business as usual, and should not be misconstrued as misconduct of any kind!<br /><br />I could go on for about 10 or 15 more paragraphs, but I don't feel like wasting my time.  All I can say is DON'T WASTE YOUR'S EITHER!!  Save your money, too!  This movie is awful, dishonest propaganda... don't trust the good reviews... they were obviously made by people who didn't follow up the film with research into its false claims, and/or they are ignorant as far as biology goes."
B0006989TE	5.0	b	I heard people talk about this movie before I went to see it.<br /><br />Yes, I did expect a horror flick, but what a nice treat and a suprise.<br /><br />I think anyone who didn't like this movie just can't accept what they didn't expect.( read shallow).<br /><br />The movie turns out to be a beautiful story about the power of love, with an essence of fantasy and horror. This is easily Mr. shyamalan's best work so far.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"I liked it a lot. At first I thought it would be a documentary written with a vegan intensity(you know, angry, blaming, condemming and invasive), but it's not. It really did open my eyes and my wife and I are much more conscious of our food and our ""votes"" in the supermarket."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"A husband and wife on the brink of divorce learn the secrets of staying in love and for establishing a secure family into which children can grow and be taught while experiencing the ""emotional security"" of a mom and dad (family unit) who love each other and them.  In that environment a child is free to grow and develop interests and life career goals with purpose.  They will also grow in respect for their parents as their parent's recognize, acknowlege, respect and encourage their individuality."
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	Great Family Movie, great family fun.<br /><br />My daughter loves this movie, I prefer the 2nd myself as it has a cool james bond feel to it.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"I took my kid (age 6) to see ""Cars"" last week, not really knowing what to expect.  I've never been into racing, but was attracted by the concept (anyone else remember the shortlived cartoon ""Wheelie""?).  Both of us were able to connect with the humor right away, which like the diverse characters in this film spans several generations.  The concept of a world populated entirely by inanimate vehicles (mostly cars, but a tractor or train here and there) is a relatively original one on the big screen, and the studio must have had a lot of fun with this one.<br /><br />Character development was terrific--just as each make and model of vehicle has its own technical characteristics in real life, each personality in ""Cars"" has its own talents and quirks.  The plot revolves around rookie racer Lightning McQueen, who is part of a 3-way tie for the Piston Cup, and must cross the country to Los Angeles where there will be a tie-breaker between himself, dependable veteran The King, and perpetual second-placer Chick Hicks.<br /><br />Along the road to Los Angeles, Lightning McQueen's selfishness is the cause of an unintended detour to a little town called Radiator Springs.  Radiatior Springs is a nifty village on route 66 complete with chrome and neon styling that the new interstate left off the map years ago.  Characters include the older and wiser Doc Hudson (Hornet), who has a secret past and manages to mentor Lighting McQueen and teach him a thing or two.  Sally is a Porsche who left fast-paced Los Angeles to settle down in Radiator Springs and open a Motel. 'Mater is the town's friendly (if rusty) towtruck with a true sense of country humor.  Flo runs the service station, Ramon the Paint and Detail shop (always with a new coat!), Luigi the tire store...There really is something for everyone, including a running humorous dialogue between ""Sarge"", an Army-regulation olive drab AMC Jeep who runs the local military surplus shop, and Fillmore, a '60's VW Bus with a psychadelic paint job.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away too much detail, I don't want to spoil the experience for fellow viewers.  My kid loved this film and understood the humor.  There were a lot of laugh out loud moments for the both of us.  As a parent, I liked the lessons ""Cars"" taught about ethics, hard work, respect, kindness, keeping your word, and the importance of friendship.  Not to mention appreciating things that aren't necessarily brand new or in the fast lane!  A cute movie, fun for the whole family, a reminder that the best things in life are sometimes hidden off the main thoroughfare.  Oh, and hang around past the credits--you WILL be rewarded with the punch line for an earlier gag!"
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	I am not a Kristen Stewart fan, and this movie didn't change that, but Cherize Theron is a wonderful villain.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Even if you don't have a Blu-Ray 3-D player (I don't), the Blu-Ray bonus disc offers a wealth of special features that takes you from initial story genesis straight through the principal filming and post-production processes.  It is reminicent of the detail put into the Aliens Extended Edition Laserdisc release.  Truly a great film with bonus features to match.
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	I bought this because it was said that all couples should see this. I truly agree. Marriage is for life and you need to give it your all before you give up. I yelled at both the actors to just stop but in the end I was happy.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"This was the most horrible, depressing movie.  The only reason I finished this movie was to try and figure out why the movie has the name that it does. I don't believe that it was so ""deep"" that I couldn't figure it out.  I just think it was a movie about a lot of senseless, brutal killing.  I just could not believe it got the academy award for best picture of the year.  It in no way deserved it in my opinion.  It did have some good acting, but for what?  It was senseless.  If you compare this movie to others throughout the years that have won the best picture awards, this was a pitiful, pitiful choice.  It definitely is not for young people, and not for people who have a problem with depression."
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	I purchased this series and the 2nd disk was broken had to go out and rent the disk to finish the series was very disappointed
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Fabulous movie. Loved kristen Stewart. Ordered one day and received the next with prime. Love it. Not for small children, otherwise awesome movie.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	`Sin City' directed by Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller is truly a fantasy cartoon for grown-up men. As this particular release of the film to DVD has virtually no extras, I can devote all my space to considering the movie.<br /><br />As a major fan of some both violent and avant-garde movies such as `Zardoz', `La Femme Nikita', `Kill Bill', and `Straw Dogs', my biggest problem with this movie is reconciling the violence with the art of the film. I suspect this issue is as old as the Greek playwrights and their philosophical critics. The most recent issue on this stage was the controversy over Mel Gibson's `The Passion of the Christ'.<br /><br />I think the issue can be stated as a question on the extent to which visceral reaction to illegal violence, sex, sadism, or whatever can outweigh the negative reaction to this social pathology or actually enhance the artistic experience, as the right amount of salt improves the taste of virtually all food.<br /><br />For starters, I believe there are great masses of viewers who will simply be so repulsed by what they consider inappropriate violence. To them, I give a gentle lecture on the Bill of Rights and a copy of the DVD `Hitch' or `The Wedding Date' as an alternative.<br /><br />The landmark movie for establishing the correct aesthetic for violence in film is `Bonnie and Clyde'. Many argued, correctly I believe, when the movie was first released that the more graphic violence and bloodshed enhanced the movie experience not by being titillating, but by revealing the horror of both the gangsters' actions and their demise. This argument has been successfully played out in hundreds of movies, not the least of which was the recent `Saving Private Ryan'.<br /><br />I believe the problem of relating this argument to `Sin City' is confounded by the comic book fantasy style of this film. It is really hard to make any case for the film as an examination of a gangster's impotence or an American army captain's dedication to duty in war when the main characters are plainly cut from a fantastical cloth. No one short of Rasputin survives strangulation on top of gunshot wounds on top of severe angina and lives to the last reel. The other side of the coin may be that the argument that the aesthetic of `Sin City' is classic 1940's film noir taken to its logical conclusion. This may be seen as `The Maltese Falcon' or `The Long Goodbye' as done by Rodriguez and Tarantino, with the part of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett taken by Frank Miller.<br /><br />All this is a rationalization to the fact that the pathological and unrealistic violence in this movie can put off even people who may be disposed to like this kind of movie. Basically, my sense of implausibility of the events in this film outweighed my sense of guilty pleasure from all the violence. `Kill Bill' may have taken me to the brink of that abyss. `Sin City' may have gone that one step too far.<br /><br />But what then explains the good reviews garnered by this film. Does `two thumbs way up' tell me I'm taking on just a little too much old age prudery and that maybe I have to recalibrate my aesthetic sensibilities?<br /><br />I will say that the cinematic artistry in the production of the movie is excellent. All the effects are done to a level which far exceeds that other recent blue screen epic, `Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' (aside from having a much better story as well). The only annoyance in the graphic artistry was where in most scenes, blood was seen as a bright red in this black and white world, while in one scene with one victim, all blood was white, not red. Very confusing!<br /><br />Another triumph was from the casting director. With Bruce Willis and Michael Madsen and Rutger Hauer and Mickey Rourke and Benicio DelToro, we are just missing Harvey Keitel and Gary Oldman to complete our rogue's gallery of seriously dark heroes and heavies. The appearance of former (`Lord of the Rings') hobbit lead Elijah Wood is a masterstroke of casting against type. I can just imagine Wood's jumping at the chance to play this role.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the sly little graphic Easter eggs such as the makes of the various automobiles, including, I believe, a Chevy Corvair, 1957 Chevy station wagon and the great finned 1959 Cadillac. Also, while the location of `Sin City', named `Basin City' is vague, there is a clear reference to Interstate 287 that runs through some of the most darkly fabled minor cities of New Jersey such as Perth Amboy.<br /><br />The movie is based on three largely unconnected episodes with one of the three serving as a bookend to the other two, opening the movie briefly, to be picked up after running through the other two stories. It is hard to tell where Tarantino's contribution may have come in. My first guess would be as the director of the Bruce Willis bookending story, but I suspect it is more likely he directed and choreographed the scenes in which the female ninja character does her stuff.<br /><br />It is hard to evaluate the acting. There is no question that the male leads, Willis, Rourke, and Clive Owen carry their weight and that the heavies are suitably heavy, but the thin dialogue and the fantastic biology and physics seen in many scenes prevents us from really becoming fully engaged with the characters.<br /><br />The bottom line on this movie is certainly to check your critical baggage at the door and simply fasten your seat belts for an unalloyed thrill ride.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"ENTOURAGE, FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS, GENERATION KILL, and now...TRUE BLOOD:  HBO has created another winner!  What's the show about?  Blood and Sex!<br /><br />Those of you who have read the other reviews here may have noticed that poor reviews typically come from viewers who had first read (and loved) the series of books written by Charlaine Harris.  I have also read the books (after I saw the series), and I can tell you...the HBO series is much MUCH better.<br /><br />The first season of the HBO series is based upon the first Harris book, but the show has diverged quite a bit from that book, and rightfully so, in my opinion.  The producers astutely decided to veer away from the lightness of the novels towards a darker, edgier vision and in the process gave the story much more depth (MUCH more than is contained within the ""romance-novel"" flavored books).  Let's hope they stay the course!<br /><br />Arguably the best opening credits of any TV show, ever (MADMEN comes in a close second).  Great cast, great characterizations: more fully developed (and thus much more interesting) than those in the novels, and a great Anna Paquin as Sookie Stackhouse.  One of the best shows of 2008 -- check it out!"
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	A great movie with a fabulous cast, director and script.  Violent for sure and not a good show for young kids, but for those who like to be scared alittle and into a place of constantly guessing the outcome, this is for you.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"I have rarely and mean RARELY have ever felt compelled to write a personal view on a film. I am a great fan of really good scifi...this is not it. I own all the major dvds on the major Alien franchise...personally saw ALIENS two times at my theater...when the BIG SCREEN meant that; not those over sized projection screens we are all now subjected to. Those were all awesome films...personally the first two Alien and Aliens kicked, the last two were mediocre at best but workable and had a story line. (also loved Gladiator and own that too; Sir Ridley Scott shined). I am personally surprised this film ever received above a one star rating by any objective critic. It SUCKED..sorry for the venacular.<br /><br />DON'T READ BEYOND THIS SINCE IT INVOLVES SPOILERS....OR LACK OF THEM.  This story starts with the alleged human god or human ancestor with a ship coming down, perhaps after him and then basically he takes some suicide drink, falls off the cliff into water and is dissolved, with DNA strands disbanding in the water he fell into and the ship leaves...no explanation what any of that meant..(even later we don't know)...later in the film we discover this weird DNA match to these massive humans or this particular human is brought up to show our lineage to them (i am guessing but we arn't sure anyway how or in what way) later wants to kill all humans on earth (ending of the film and the other heroes ((captain of the expidtions ship)) destroys the ship going back to destory earth) and inbetween all that are good actors with no script to work with and having multiple different FRAGMENTS of individual stories that in the end never become cohesive. No one can like or have any personal bond to any of the characters because they are too many and too many individual elements that never largely meet anywhere. But our expedition ship arrives. No Aliens actually transpire but the story alludes (sort of) that these vases found in the caves they explored were (aka alien pods) found (yes they went many times to caves and opened up several doors and saw holographs of our alleged alien/ancestors running around the caves, which we chased after them...again nothing is resolved for sure there or ultimately ""explained"" at any time for sure). Two crew members who chose to leave early and ran into some snake like creature and now want to make friends with it...strange since they left earlier for reasons they were geologists and wanted to go back to the ship and left the safety of the party to avoid the strange holographs that made them feel unsafe...but later seeing this snake thing, they almost play with it like a pet...to their end. (ONly Hollyweird can write such inconsistent BS). Later it is suggested or inferred that this anomoly or the area was a product of the military (aliens for biotech warfare is alluded to) and a greedy company to make money from that helped in the construction of something...again what we never are told (geeze does this sound new??) but sent this party to this rock/planet. David the robot/cyborg is evil then turns kind of good but protects his architect who is this old man who funded this operation, who was in a holograph at the beginning of the film and was to be dead long before they arrived and before the major crew being defreezed for the expedition...but lo and behold he is alive (towards the end of the film) and with all the greedy company (motives) and military weapon testing (movites to create something and not sure what???) alluding to the first story line and now the changed story line was really this old guy (the one funding the expedition)was looking to avoid death...his fountain of youth hoping to be found in the alien ship...of course that never happened and he and the robot/cyborg David died...(well David the robot is decapitated but alive and can speak....geeezze now isn't this new) the alleged hero (who got impregnaged by her briefly exposed boyfriend to an ""alien"" microbe)had this weird thing removed from her stomach...that later grew and killed the alleged ancestor/father to the human race who also wanted to destory earth ((again)) we don't know why) now he (David the robot/cyborg) later (missing his body from his head wants to help her (the hero) after she successfully runs from the ship and the evil human god/ancestor now fighting an alleged alien that came from her stomach, this alleged protype alien that looks like a squid (truly national geo has a more frightening large squid photoed than this) and kills this alleged human ancestor/god with some weird tongue going down our alleged ancestor/alien throat and David the now NICE robot/cyborg will take her (our hero) elsehwere to find the answers to all of this....THE END......I truly wish I were joking but that is it (largely) in a nutshell...I DEMAND my whopping $5 I paid for watching on ""demand"" tv.  Horrible, horrible film and yes Sir Ridley Scott should bow his head in shame to have his name associated with this monstrosity. (as far as these 5 or 4 points stars given; my ONLY explanation is they didn't WATCH the film or they are friends or relatives to the performers, director with a personal issue to hold).<br /><br />OK now for the good points:  (crickets..the sound of silence hmmmmmmmmmmm)  Ok Ridley Scotts name; good actors (with a limited script); hype and good special effects...truly THE END! (STILL WANT MY $5 REFUND....ON PRINCIPAL)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Martin Scorsese pulls off yet another winner of a film and finally wins his long overdue and very much deserved oscar. Even though it may not be his best film, it sure was the best film of 2006. The Daparted contains great performances all around, plus a story line taht keeps you on the edge of your seat. Plus unexpected twists and turns that will sure to surprise you.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"I guess this movie was good, but I really wish the directors would consider making the movies a little longer so they could include more of the book details.  My least favorite movie so far was Prisoner of Azkaban.  The actors lips were way too red and the general ""feeling"" of the film I didn't care for.  I did think the special effects were excellent though.  Sorcerers Stone was by far my favorite out of all the movies so far.  I am still going to purchase this when it comes out of DVD though.  I have all the audio books and listen to them quite often.  Even my husband has gotten interested in the books via the audio versions."
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"This is a bad film on every level. Its an exploitation film made to cash out anything left in the character and you can kind of tell that everyone involved hated what they were doing (with the exception of Shia Labeouf who seems clueless about how bad it all is).<br /><br />The Indiana Jones character was a homiage to 1930s/1940s adventure films and serials. The first mistake made is that this sequal is taken out of that context and placed into a cardboard vision of the 1950s. Elvis (check). Nuclear weapons (check). UFOs (check). Eisenhower (check). Phony leather biker extras fresh from the wild one (check). Commie russians (check). Joe McCarthy (check). None of it works. Its like putting Dracula or Frankenstein in a 1960s beach movie.<br /><br />And of course because of who owns the character, the film has to throw a large amount of cash at ILM in exchange for big cheesy CGI effects. The first problem is that the effects are fake looking. The second is that effects are often for their own sake rather than to serve the story of the film.<br /><br />The filmmakers go out of their way to make Harrison Ford look old. And Ford sleepwalks through the film like it was the last thing he ever wanted to do.<br /><br />Shia Labeouf is horrible. He can't really be called an actor because he shows no sign of being able to act. He plays ""annoying"" real well but thats about it. Speilberg gave his reasons for casting him as: ""He's every mother's son, every father's spitting image, every young kid's best pal and every girl's possible dream."" Saying that is either a sign of being out of touch with reality or a cry for help.<br /><br />Its a funny thing. You would think that people making a film with a large budget, low expectations and little chance of another sequel would just have fun with it. But they didn't. This film is the opposite in every sense of the original raiders."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"Great collection! I was only a Twilight fan at first but then heard of the True Blood series & now I'm most definitely addicted to this show! It's got sex, drugs, vampires and other ""abnormals""...I love it! Can't say enough<br />About it!"

B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This movie has changed my life.  I no longer eat meat, eggs, or dairy products, I read labels, and try to buy only certified organic food.  I show Super Size Me in my high school health classes, Food INC. is the next major film to make the world aware of what we are eating, the major food industries abuse of farmers, workers, animals, and the ultimately the American people. I bought two copies of this film, one for my neighbors, family and friends, and one for myself.  I cannot get those images of penned, caged, and slaughtered animals out of my head, nor the working conditions for the meat industries employees.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"This is a fantastic video if you love ventriloquism.  It also gives you the option to watch it censored or uncensored, so if there are children, they can also watch it and enjoy the magic that Jeff Dunham has to bring his puppets ""alive"".  You will find yourself watching and listening to the puppets themselves, forgetting that a human brings them to life.  Just a wonderful video."
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	Although you know there is one more movie coming, you just don't want this one to end.  Brilliant cliffhanger to make you crave the next installment.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Oh, my!  I knew it was bad but I had no idea the way our food is grown is as bad as it is!  I knew beef was bad but chicken is worse.  I had no idea how our vegetables and grains are produced.  The farmers are abused and threatened.  I am very blessed because I can buy so much from local producers at Farmer's Markets.<br />I highly recommend this DVD to EVERYONE!!!!!!  It really is life altering. A friend bought it from Amazon, told me and I ordered it from Amazon that afternoon, it came in 3 days and I really think EVERYONE needs to see this.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"This is perhaps the most powerful movie in my lifetime...and I am old.  The strengths of this documentary is two fold.  First, it clearly shows the lack of objectivity in science today.  I know of what I speak as I was one of the 100 plus professors denied tenure for doubting Saint Darwin...this in spite of over 100 peer reviewed publications, my invitation and speaking as the keynote speaker at an international biotelemetry conference at Oxford University and the BBC filming my alligator research for the TV documentary, a smile for the crocodile.<br /><br />Second, it clearly shows some of the detrimental applications of evolution in the mass murder of over 5 millions Jews and other by Hitler, attempting to ""improve"" the race by ""helping"" evolution eliminate those he deemed unfit.<br /><br />Perhaps the most important effect of this outstanding movie is it has opened public discussion of this important topic.  Yet, some still believe science is above all objective.  It is not.<br /><br />E. Norbert Smith,Ph.D."
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	Loved the story line and soundtrack.  Good values in the plot also.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Top to bottom this is the standard that all comic book movie will be judged by. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. It is the perfect blend of comedy, and a movie that stays true to the comic. The special effects are great! Jeff Bridges does a great job as the villian and I must say that the bald head looks cool as hell on him. Even Pepper Potts is good. I am not a fan of Paltrow but she is great in this part!<br /><br />GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"All I can say about the oy polloi who gave this film two or less stars is... they are either not highly educated, motivated or have been dulled to a grey mush by the anesthetized & antiseptic films that seem to meet their simple canon. American cinema has been spoilt for far too long by commercialization and by the dumbing AND the numbing down of its collective cultural mindset. To the point that basic storytelling touchstones as symbolism, mood & character development are lost on the untrained and unforgiving mind.<br /><br />""No Country for Old Men"" is a remarkable tone poem of epic dramatic sweep. It's ending ISN'T ""solved"" by the screenwriter. It is left for the viewer to piece together. If you arrive at anything of an epiphany, Coen, Coen & McCarthy have accomplished quite a feat. Kudos to the legendary Roger Deakins for the absolutely astonishing photography. The man's the best in the biz & this just furthers his rep as an auteur.<br /><br />And oh, by the way, Bardem's performance, the method acting so unforced & nuanced it would have made Lee Strasberg applaud, was absoLUTEly deserving of Oscar note, as he may have set the villain bar to brand new heights, friendo. The always excellent Tommy Lee Jones brings an warm &  leathered humanity & crisp regional core to the piece that centers it on us all...gives us a toehold to gain entry into an otherwise surreal, Boschian Grand Guignol to which perhaps only the toughened border folks can relate. Huzzah to all involved!"
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	This film is a pack of lies, poorly presented, and unbelievably tedious. I was unable to watch the whole thing. It made me so angry I couldn't bear it. I lasted about 45 minutes.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	Very well done movie. Enjoyed movie very much.  Followed the book's story line. Enjoyed seeing the characters come to life. Well done special effects were great. Harry was darker in this movie. Ron was less winy.  Hermine was very brave as was Harry.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	The program is really insane. Great for already fit people who want a challenge and a way to get to the next level of fitness. Program involves a lot of plyometric or jump training which may be harmful to people with arthritis or painful joints due to the impact of the exercise moves. Its been 4 weeks and its been very challenging thus far.
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	"I have just never responded to Scorsese [okay, I liked Kundun]. I just don't find much meaning in all that macho blustering, and I find his movies very unemotional and cold. I also just don't respond to gangster movies. I don't find them compelling at all. So this may account for my feeling of intense annoyance when walking out of The Departed.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes are fantastic. Scorsese lays out the histories of Damon as Sullivan, being a good boy and rising up the police ranks while all the time beholden to Nicholson's Boston crime boss Costello. DiCaprio has a more troubled history [during which I was never convinced WHY he wanted to be a cop], but both of their stories are laid out in a very quick and energetic way. The friend I went with was talking about the quick, staccato editing here that ""is almost like the intro to a TV show where they tell you what happened last week,"" but for me it really worked.<br /><br />So Damon goes on this elite police force and DiCaprio is asked to go undercover with Costello. From there it's all Donnie Brasco, Donnie Brasco, Donnie Brasco [okay, there's one gangster movie I responded to], with the additional wrinkle of that both guys need to discover the identity of the other one. There are lots of near-misses, lots of one-person-relaying-information-while-the-other-is-too, and gallons of macho bluster and OTT mugging from Nicholson [who wasn't quite as bad with that as I expected]. There is funny faux-Mamet patter like Alec Baldwin quickly saying ""I'm gonna go outside and get a smoke. You want a smoke? No? What are you, some kind of fitness freak? Go f*** yourself,"" or a guy, after being shot in the knee. Whining ""I thought I was supposed to go into shock. I'm not in shock. It hurts!"" that are amusing, but that's when you still believe that this story is going to come to something.<br /><br />I can't even be bothered to talk about the many twists and turns, because in the end they turn out mostly to be just time-wasters, and as we headed into the last hour I started thinking ""Why do we need this scene? This scene could go. And what about that scene before? That was just another version of the many scenes we've seen before"" which is not something I think any filmmaker wants the audience to be concerned with while they're watching a film.<br /><br />And finally, it just doesn't come to much. Maybe it's a case of my expectations; I thought we were building toward a big showdown between Damon and DiCaprio where they would really have at it, and then it's getting to be 30 minutes `til the end [I was definitely waiting], then 15 minutes `til the end.... And that's when I really started to turn against the movie. Which is not even to mention the overall dissatisfaction of the ending. I want to avoid giving anything away, but suffice to say that the thing I wanted to see, we did not see. And we saw a whole lot of something else that, yeah, I guess it's one worldview, but it's not a worldview I find particularly compelling or interesting. And it's kind of a worldview that you don't need two-and-a-half hours to express, and is probably why I was so bitter that I felt this movie wasted so much of my time... for that. But Scorsese seems to be unable to make a movie that is less than two-and-a-half hours, and if he did, well, how would we know that it's an important film?<br /><br />My friend [who liked it a little more than I did] asked me ""well, how is this different from De Palma?"" [And I was indeed sitting there wishing De Palma had directed it instead.] My answer was, well, in De Palma there is emotional content that gives me something to get involved with, whereas with Scorsese it's all tough guy blather with a little emotional stuff [here, the psychologist] thrown in for a little color, but the focus is on the guns and the cell phones and the tension and just how very hard these guys are. Wow, they sure are hard, tough guys, Marty. Wow.<br /><br />Secondly, when De Palma enters into a set-piece, the sense I get from what's on screen [and this is highly subjective, just my feeling] is that he's inviting you, the audience, to play along and he wants you to enjoy it. The sense I get with Scorsese is that he wants you to passively sit back and admire his skill. Add that to how cold I find his films, and the sense I get is of Scorsese casting himself as the tough guy through his show-offy-yet-stand-offish technique, just as his films are filled with tough guys that he is unable to be. Yeah, yeah, Marty, you're the man, okay? Now go be the man over there.<br /><br />The final shot is a somewhat sledgehammer-subtle message that there will always be corruption in the highest offices of power. Is this a statement? Well, obviously it's a statement, but is it an interesting statement? Did we need a 150 minutes to tell us this? Especially given the current state of Congress?<br /><br />Everyone else loves this film, so take that as you may. As I said, I just don't respond to gangster movies and I just don't respond to Scorsese movies. The performances here are all very good and it's certainly well made but... take a half hour off and I'd be fine. And change the ending."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I've been a fan of Dunham for a long time - I saw him live in Orlando in 1992(?) and was fan before that. I knew what to expect, but my wife (who has belly-laughed exactly once since we were married 8 years ago) was totally taken by surprise - she laughed so-o-o hard!!! Dunham is funny, creative and his puppets are so believable you can actually suspend belief and think of them as people. Dunham's wit is great - even off the cuff things like when a member of the audience steps out on a call of nature - Dunham waits until he comes back to continue.... One of the funniest comics you'll ever see...
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"Addressing the review Soulles Christmas.<br /><br />Since when does a move (book, painting, poem etc.) need to have a universal theme? Certainly there are many who don't have Christmas as a cultural tradition, but certainly find other reasons to enjoy the company of family and friends in the spirit of giving at least once a year (well apparently some don't). How exceptionally dull this world would be without cultural distinctiveness anyway. Of course there are some inclined to force their views upon those around them with a sense of indignation toward the recipient. Have we not learned the folly in this yet?<br /><br />I don't see why some feel it is compulsory to view Christmas from the standpoint of capitalism (slaves and coca-cola, that descends to inventive level). Is it possible to realize that the central idea could be about giving (that should be universal)? Of course when someone finds it necessary to preface any gift giving they do with ""You know how hard I had to work to buy you these things,"" I prefer they keep the item and work a little less, they may realize that giving isn't really a sacrifice (you can actually feel good doing it - imagine that).<br /><br />Polar Express is simply I fun movie wrapped up in a Christmas theme. If Santa gets under your skin, because he offends your grown-up, seriously minded, it's all about me, soulless view of the world, go back to your scheming ways and board rooms this movie will grate on your nerves. If you like trains and unique animation give it a go it's actually quite fun to watch.<br /><br />PS Edward Scissorhands is a great movie also &lt;g>."
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"I'm in total agreement w/ J.Lail. This is listed as a scary movie? A bunch of freaky unnatractive pilgrim people living in a wildlife preserve while the elders of the community lead them to believe it's like that everywhere. Can you say cult?? So I'm waiting for the monsters- let's see terror! We see a hint of a scary figure. And then- what? It's all made up? No monsters? Stories made up by really mentally challenged elders to keep the village from going into the ""woods"". A crazy guy dresses up in costume to follow the ucky blind blonde to get medical supplies after crazy boy stabs her weird ""boyfriend"" THE STUPIDEST movie I have seen in a long time. No scary things. Avoid at all costs!!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I ordered this for my fiance and let me tell you, I have watched parts of this DVD and watched him do it and this is definitely insane! He is a young and fairly in shape guy (works out daily) and he almost falls over after every work out! He is a week into the program and loves it. We did order from beachbody through amazon and had no issues with packaging or DVD's not working. Good luck to everyone who tries this workout! It is crazy!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	delivery time was great, this is a xmas pressie so have not watch them yet, we know that these are just hilarious, so cant wait to watch them
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Excellent product - lives up to its name!  Can't wait to see what the end result is as I'm in week 5 and seeing results already.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is an ultra-intense, no holds barred, crazy workout.  There are strength training movements using your bodyweight, but the focus is really on cardio.<br />I am a 23 year old female and was in really good shape before I started this program.  Even so, the workouts kicked my butt!  Insanity will challenge even those in unbelievable shape.<br />Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.  I love these super high energy workouts and actually look forward to them.  I love that they are relatively short (average about 45 mintues, less if you skip the time consuming and unnecessary pre-workout stretch).  Shaun T and his crew are very motivating.  The music isn't great, but isn't bad either.<br />My only gripe- the warmups.  They are very intense and might be an overload for someone not used to warming up that fast.  And the fit test has no warm up so you are putting yourself at risk of injury if you go right into it.  When I first started I was getting awful headaches whenever I worked out and my chiropractor said it was because I was overloading my system.  So I would do my own pre-warm up warm up for a while until my body adjusted.<br />A side note- I have actually gained weight since I started.  I was pretty thin to begin with and doing such intense workouts really increases your appetite!  So if you are trying to lose weight, be conscious of that.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"""Cars"" IMHO is the best Pixar movie yet.  It has much more for us Baby Boomers than the other films.  It has humor for all ages, especially the adults.  Young kids 3-6 probably won't like it but older kids and adults will.<br /><br />It is the best ""G"" rated family movie I have seen in years.  Go see it and stay through ALL of the credits!!"
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" written by George Lucas and directed by Steven Spieldberg""<br /><br />1957: WWII is over and the US and Soviet Union have emerged as the worlds super powers and the Cold War is begun. The Soviets have heard of an artifact that they suspect will provide them with the ultimate weapons. The only person who can locate this item is none other that Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. (Harrison Ford)"". Jones is captures and forced to go to work and adventure ensues...<br /><br />I think Lucas and Spieldberg made the same mistake with ""Kingdom of the Crystal"" as many do when making sequels trilogies and the like. They worked harder on pushing the action sequences and special effects than they did on the story and how it unfolds which is usually expected but the fact that this mistake was made by these two makes it a little more disheartening an unexpected.<br /><br />The Good: The good you enjoyed in the other Indy movies is present in ""Kingdom"" as well. Harrison Ford actually still manages to pull the Indy character off. It was nice that they re-visited the Marion Ravenwood character (Karen Allen). Good performances by Cate Blanchett as Irano Spalko who is Indies nemesis this go around and Shia LaBeouf as well.<br /><br />The Bad: I think they pushed too far with the unbelievable escapes, lucky falls, near death misses etc. I realize this in an Indiana Jones movie and everything isn't supposed to be believable but there is still a line as to how far it should be pushed and I think the line was shattered. I can't go into detail without giving spoilers so will just leave it at that. As I said a classic mistake in that they tried to out do all of the predecessors in the wrong way.<br /><br />They added CG special effects in some scenes. I liked the fact that all of the old movies were done with practical effects and I think they should have stuck with that. That was kind of a signature of the Indy franchise.<br /><br />I also think that the comic relief was overdone. When you couple the fact that the comic relief was overdone with the fact that the actions sequences were overdone the finished product almost has a campy feel to it which isn't good.<br /><br />Overall: ""Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"" isn't terrible and is still an enjoyable movie for the most part. If you are a fan of the franchise go check this out but don't expect something equal to ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU"">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a>"" as this movie pales in comparison."
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	But I will be waiting at least another 5 days. :(<br />This review is for AMAZON'S Lame-oh shipping delay.<br /><br />Why bother pre-ordering from Amazon if it doesn't get shipped until 3 days or so after I could have bought it at W*lm*rt?<br /><br />Amazon gets a thumb down on this one. I guess I figure that, if people pre-order, then the inventory should match up and we shouldn't find ourselves gritting our teeth that we didn't just get a copy when we stopped at the W*lmart. Or the Kr*ger. Or order it for ~ 17 bux from an Amazon marketplace seller who had it the day after it became available.<br />If they had it....why didn't Amazon?!?<br /><br />'Nuff said, next cool movie, I'll just pick it up somewhere else. Amazon blew it this time.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is an amazing program. If you want to lose weight AND be in the best shape of your life, it's only 60 days away. I'm only on week 4 and I've already lost 24 pounds. Please try this if you're physically able to. Remember to consult a physician before doing this program as it is not for everyone. But if it isn't too hard for you, you/re crazy not to try it!!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	These movies have never been good, especially with the books held in comparison.  Their popularity has resulted only from the books.  Improvements are made in each new movie, but this one was a disappointment even with my lowered standards.  I think it was mostly the emotional scenes.  Corny enough to make you cringe.  They took the ending of this book, which the entire book leads up to and which is hugely critical to the story, and they compressed it into a few minutes.  I felt the need to apologize to those who saw it who I knew hadn't read the book and justify why I like the book in the first place.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	This is a truly great movie that takes a look at what is going on inside of America's colleges. This movie will show you how America's colleges have been 'expelling' Christian professors. This was an eye opener!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	We bought this movie as a gag gift for my dad, because he's a big fan of Paul Newman. I must say, I was pleasantly suprised. The youngest person living in my parent's house is 18, but we all still enjoyed this movie. My dad also loved Toy Story (my brother and I were children when that one came out). I've seen all of the Disney Pixar movies, and this is my second favorite, behind the original Toy Story, but above The Incredibles. I wasn't a huge fan of Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc, or Finding Nemo. If you liked the same movies that I did, then you will like this one too.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is a great comedian.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone.  A great way to make you laugh.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I have watched this DVD 3 times with different family members and friends since it arrived in early December.  I laugh as much as I did the first time I saw it, if not more.  Each time I pick up details that I didn't see before when I watched.  The material is extremely funny.  His interaction with the various dummies brings them alive.  They each have individual mannerisms and I forget that they are inanimate objects.  This is especially true when he has Peanut and Jose Jalape&ntilde;o on a Stick having a conversation and arguing with each other.  Jose is complaining to Jeff and Peanut is laughing to himself over what he did to Jose at the same time. The talent it takes to switch back and forth between characters, accents and mannerisms and make it believable is pure artistry!  I highly recommend this DVD!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5LEXS"">Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself</a><br /><br />This is the funniest think I have ever seen.  I can't stop quoting and have watched it several times without losing interest.  Every one of the puppets are funny, Walter, Sweet Daddy D, Bubba J, Peanut and Jose Jalapeno.  Not to mention that the stand up that Jeff does by himself before he starts with the puppets is hysterical!  I laughed all the way through and then kept laughing after."
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	I enjoyed this movie.  It had a good plot and the comic-book feel of the production worked well.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes their drama with a dark side.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"When I saw the first advertizing for this show and noticed that Paul Giamatti would have the leading role in HBO's mini-series <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGWQG8"">John Adams (HBO Miniseries)</a>, I had my doubts that he could pull it off.  However, after the first episode, I was completely hooked.  Giamatti ended up more than ""pulling it off"", he did an outstanding job, doing justice to McCullough's wonderful novel <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/141657588X"">John Adams</a>.<br /><br />The producers took the time to do it right--costumes, set-design... even using the language of the day.  At some points it was a challenge to easily penetrate the eloquent prose of the day; but it also made the production more genuine... as if I were transported back to the time period.<br /><br />I've ordered by copy online so we may enjoy it again and again.<br /><br />John Cathcart<br />Award-winning author of ""Delta 7"""
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I've seen Jeff in concert at least 6 or 7 times before, and he's funny everytime. If you've seen him in concert before in the last year or two, about half of what you see on this DVD is new and about half is material you've seen before, but that doesn't matter--stuff this funny can be seen over and over and you'll still laugh. A word of caution to parents, though: Jeff's characters look warm and fuzzy, and to be honest, compared to many contemporary comedians Jeff is really clean, but his stuff is NOT apporpriate for the youngest members of the family. True, there's a bleeped and non-bleeped version on this DVD, and the bleeped version is a definite R, but the non-bleeped version is still PG or PG-13. Just keep that in mind.<br /><br />By the way, someone mentioned earlier that he couldn't find Jeff's concert information at Ticketmaster. You can see a list of all of his shows at his website, onastick.com
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This is one of the best superhero movies ever made so far. It has 5-star action, a 5-star story, and 5-star actors.
B000H7I6CU	2.0	b	"Cars was the first Pixar production to disappoint me. For a family with no interest in automobiles or racing or Nascar, the film had little to offer.<br /><br />The characters weren't anything new. An arrogant lead (who never grew on me), a hick, a fiesty businesswoman type...these are all characters that have been done before. Where were the totally new ideas, like Dory the forgetful fish and Flik the inventor ant?<br /><br />The plot was a transparent recycling of ""Doc Hollywood"", completely devoid of surprises. The audience knew from the moment Lightning McQueen arrived in town, that he would eventually come to love Radiator Springs. And personally, since I didn't care about the characters, the race held no suspense for me at all. It simply didn't matter who won or lost.<br /><br />Aside from a couple of isolated moments of humor, I didn't even laugh until the John Ratzenberger scenes during the credits.<br /><br />I'm sure the film was a lot of fun for John Lasseter to make, but it wasn't as fun for those of us who don't share Lasseter's love of cars."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	This last Academy Award winning movie for best picture is simply that---the best picture!  I was mesmerized, scared and blown away!  Totally impressed!  On the edge of my seat and my eyes never left the screen the entire 122 minutes!  The Coen brothers did it again!  And I thought Fargo was good!<br /><br />My best buddy and Amazon friend, CLINT BRONSON, told me I had to see it it, because it was my type of movie, boy, he really knows me inside and out!<br /><br />Briefly, the movie begins where Lewellyn (Josh Brolin) goes hunting and comes across a bunch of dead bodies---humans & dogs both.  He investigates and finds a briefcase full of money.  He takes it, sends his wife to her crazy mother, and tries to take care of himself.  But Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), one ultimate, psychopathic killer, is the owner of the briefcase and has put a transponder in it. NOTHING will stop him from getting his possession back.  Tommy Lee Jones is the local Texas sheriff and Woody Harrelson is the bounty hunter.  This is one hell of a journey and back and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />I liken this film to Silence of the Lambs---one exciting movie---FLAWLESS!  Buy it and enjoy!  The sound on a 5.1 surround system was so intense my dogs were barking from a distant room in the house---they were convinced it was real, and they don't do that often.<br /><br />THANK YOU CLINT, for more-or-less forcing me to buy this---it is definitely one of the best!

Besides false advertisement I am pretty sure that is against the law seeing as how they made 13.00 profit off of me for something that they never paid for to begin with. I am going to try and contact Amazon.com to see if I can get this seller removed but until then buyers BEWARE"
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of movies. Is it the best quality - no. Is it the best acting - no. However,that is only because it was done on a shoestring budget. Movies like this can't get the expensive and special effects of Hollywood movies but it still does a pretty good job.  It's really sad that there are some people who are going to see that this is a Christian movie and never watch at all or won't follow through. This has so many good lessons for everyone.<br /><br />There are some fire and accident scenes thrown in that will keep you on the edge of your seat. However, the main part of this movie is that it can help if you're in a marriage - whether good or bad. If you think it's hopeless, it shows it's isn't. If you think it's good, then it shows how to keep it good.  If you had a previous marriage that didn't work out, it can show you how to be a person wothy of being married, finding the mate and being the right mate. If you are wanting to find someone, there are tons of lessons to show you what to do and not do. It can also be a great movie for anyone who has any kind of addiction, whether it be porn, alcohol, drugs, etc.  The scene of him dealing with his addiction was wonderful and the whole idea of how that addiction was destroying his marriage was so important.<br /><br />Because of time limits, they sort of made one part a bit more speedy. There was a part where she told him that it would be a while before she could trust him again.  Sometimes, it can take nearly a lifetime to rebuild trust but that doesn't mean that life is not wonderful and that marriage is not wonderful in the meantime.  Every little thing they do to prove that trust just makes it better.<br /><br />My husband loved the surprise ending the father revealed to his son.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of this movie, most people won't know. When he had the kissing part with his wife, the scene goes to shadows and his real wife stepped up for that part because they believed that a person should not be kissing someone other than their mate. That's something I hate about other movies and wonder how spouses handle it. No wonder Hollywood divorces are so high.<br /><br />There are funny scenes thrown in but there is room for plenty of tears.  Don't miss this movie!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"I really liked this DVD. Jeff Dunham is so good, you actually ""forget"" that his friends are puppets! Such a variety of characters: cranky old guy, flashy black guy, not-too-bright white guy, even hispanic ""on a stick""! So funny, you'll laugh till you cry!"
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	"My take on this movie..?  I wouldn't recommend watching it.  It's not like it was epic and awesome and so what the hell if it's violent, depressing and disgusting (although Tommy Lee Jones' presence in ANY movie gives it at least enough value to be rated).  Nah, it's more like this... just some crazy s.o.b. running around after some wannabe cowboy/lousy-hunter idiot who accidentally finds some drug money.  Both get shot up.. *SPOILER STOP HERE -- *FINAL WARNING!! -- k, so bad guy gets to use spiffy li'l air gun to make himself unique whilst breaking and entering and shooting ""south'n innocents"" for no reason, plus we get the added bonus of watching lots and LOTS and lots of black, thick, icky but definitely fake blood dribble, gush, spray, splash and ooze from countless folks dead or alive.  This formula (yep, that's it) continues throughout.  I am stunned that anybody offered awards for this.  Seriously?  ""Best Picture Oscar?""  Anyway.. violent (but not in a fun way), Stupid vs Evil contest where evil wins.. sigh (whatever!) left me (and mine) feeling disgusted, numb and stunned that this ""award winning"" movie is what wins awards in the first place these days.<br /><br />Here's hoping America (and Hollywood award pickers) raise the bar.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones... good God man... you're still one of the greatest actors who ever lived, your epic performances can't even be stifled by stories like this.  Bravo."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	After watching The Departed I pretty much knew that this was the movie that would finally win Martin Scorcese an Oscar for best director.  The Departed is basically a distillation of all of the themes and techniques that Scorcese has been exploring since the mid 70's.  Honor, loyalty, and crime are all in The Departed.  His quick and creative edits, fast paced dialogue, apt placement of music, and quick burst of violence are also present.<br /><br />So there was a tremendous sense of the familiar when I watched The Departed.  The only thing that was really different is that there are no longer Italian mobsters like in Goodfellas and Casino, but Irish cops and Irish mobsters.  But The Departed is hardly just a rehash.  You can tell that Scorcese's job is making movies, but he definitely loves his job.<br /><br />The Departed follows the exploits of two main characters; Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a cop who has been placed undercover inside of mobster Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) organization, and Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who is a mobster that has been placed inside of the Massachusetts State Police to act as informant for Costello.  The two men work against each other at every turn, and they both engage in a cat and mouse game to try and outwit the other.<br /><br />The interaction between the characters is based around the duality of each role.  Costigan is acting like a tough thug even though he is a cop who comes from a decidedly middle class background.  Sullivan is a mobster who has been working for Costello ever since he was a kid but looks and acts like a straight laced, clean cut young cop.  As the movie goes on, both men have a hard time maintaining the roles that they are playing.  Costigan begins to show his vulnerability and have panic attacks and abuse Oxycotin, while Sullivan makes some attempts at being a legitimate citizen.  He gets engaged to a police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga), and expresses a desire to start over in a new city and become a lawyer.<br /><br />The performances are uniformly good throughout the movie.  DiCaprio puts in the best performance of his life playing Costigan and was robbed by not being nominated for an Oscar.  The subtlety, paranoia, and desperation DiCaprio puts in to the role have you really feeling for his character.  His performance ranks up there with Pacino's Frank Serpico as desperate and paranoid cop performances.<br /><br />Besides his role in the Talented Mr. Ripley, this is probably the most evil character Damon has ever played.  His performance is no where near as dynamic as DiCaprio's, but he is mostly convincing as Sullivan.  Nicholson mostly hams up his performance as Costello, but it adds some comic relief to the movie.  He had me laughing out loud when he was sniffing around like a rat and when he comes out of a back room with his hands covered in blood.  The dark house of the movie is Farmiga, who's character Madolyn is vulnerable, confused, but strong at the same time.  She is in love with two men who lead false lives, but she tries to stay genuine and authentic throughout.<br /><br />This isn't even mentioning the performances of Mark Wahlberg, who plays the abrasive Sgt. Dingnam, Martin Sheen who plays Captian Queenan, or Alec Baldwin who the quirky and high strung Captain Ellerby.  All three put in great performances as well.<br /><br />The music is also a high point in the movie.  The well placed Dropkick Murphy's tune I'm Shipping Up to Boston adds an interesting sense of dread to the movie.  The rest of the music, even the score is also very effective.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended and ranks of one of Scorcese's best films.  He may not be breaking any kind of new ground with The Departed, but he keeps refining his craft and is on top of his game.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	We are a large family (9 of us), and all of us enjoy superhero movies. My husband is a comic book geek, and we have all learned about the DC and Marvel universes via osmosis. In other words, we know our comic book heroes.<br /><br />Ironman far outshines all other comic-based movies to date. This movie has the rare mixture of a comic book feel, great story, characters you care about, AND...NO Cheese. I was hesitant when they cast Downey for the part- I am a huge fan, but felt he would not make a good Tony Stark. I was completely wrong- Downey IS Tony Stark. Flawless. The Director was wise enough to let Downey do what he does best- ad lib. He is a natural comedian, and added just enough humor to turn an ok role into a work of art. This movie would have been average without his comedic presence.<br /><br />Paltrow ended up being a good choice as well. She is like wallpaper most of the movie, present, but not overwhelming. This allows Downey to stay in the spotlight where he belongs.<br /><br />I have seen ALL of the comic based movies, as well as many of the animated straight to DVD as well. Mind you, there are many other good movies. Heath Ledger was INCREDIBLE as the Joker in the latest Batman movie. However, as an overall great comic-based movie, Ironman is going to be really hard to beat as my all-time favorite.<br /><br />I hope there is an Ironman sequel in the planning, and hoping they do as good a job with the Avengers as they did with this one. MArvel has stepped it up a notch. Maybe this will push DC into giving us the Justice League movie we all know they're capable of????
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	Very dissapointed. Good acting, but the screenplay is just awful. Did the person who wrote it read the book? I hope they won't let him to mutilate the next one.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	No wonder Brandon Frasier passed on this one.<br /><br />Raiders is one of my favorite movies. The second one is okay, the third I enjoyed quite a bit.<br /><br />But I don't remember any silly little CGI creatures in the originals. There was Indy's old flame, Marion - in Skull her character is abandoned - all you get is Karen Alen with a dumb smile on her face. When a jeep lands on a tree and springs off it into a river - she has a ridiculous smile the whole time. The original Indy flicks were fun but almost scary at times. This one is just plain silly. CGI ants, monkeys (the monkey scene is probably one of the lowest points in the flick), prairie dogs, etc. And yes, they're silly, too!<br /><br />The dialog is so stiff at times, scenarios are so forced, all I could do was wait for the movie to end. And it took a long time for that wonderful moment to come.<br /><br />There's not really much of a plot. There is a skull, they must get it and place it somewhere. That's it. And oh my, the last 20 minutes must have $30 million in CGI but not much really happens.<br /><br />If you loved the over the top CGI from the first 3 Indy movies and the complete lack of an interesting story, then you'll LOVE this one.<br /><br />I would rank this down as one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Probably about halfway in I lost interest and spent more time examining my fingernails, noticing all the little details at my theater I'd never paid attention to. I didn't have a phone or Gameboy so there wasn't a lot to do.<br /><br />I've spent more time discussing Crystal Skull than I had to. May the minutes wasted on Crystal Skull be a warning to those fortunate enough not to have scene the Mummy 4.<br /><br />I'd really like it if George Lucas stopped producing films.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	We love this guy. No matter how many times you watch, they are just as funny
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"I had heard mixed reviews of this film before I went to see it. I heard it wasn't M. Night Shyamalan's best work and I wasn't expecting much. I actually thought from the trailers that I had already figured out the whole plot... but I was way off.<br /><br />The film opens to a small grave-side ceremony where a man buries his young son after a lengthy illness. The grave marker gives us the time period - 1897. In this modest village, the townsfolk are friendly and easy going. All are mild-tempered and seem to have strong family bonds. There are chickens and sheep - even the occasional dog, but we never see a train, a wagon or a horse - the only mode of transportation in this town is by foot.<br /><br />We quickly learn that there is something sinister that bonds these townsfolk and it's not just the brevity of life in this era. There are creatures - very large creatures, with hideous claws and a creepy growl that live in the woods surrounding the village. There is a truce among them - no one from the village ventures to the woods and for many years, the creatures have avoided entering the village.<br /><br />Dead animals start appearing - baby sheep and chickens - killed and clawed - all fur removed, but the meat remains - just the animals skinned alive for no apparent reason other than to frighten the villagers.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix plays Lucious Hunt, a soft-spoken, thoughtful young man who is the only child of his widowed mother. His mother, played by Sigourney Weaver, is one of the town's elders. Lucious approaches the elders' weekly meeting, asking permission to pass through the woods and go to the towns to retrieve new medicines that could help prevent deaths of more children in the future. The death of the young boy, Daniel, greatly affected Lucious and he fears more dead children more than he fears the creatures.<br /><br />We find that all of the elders once lived in the towns - all of them had beloved family members that were cruelly murdered in the towns by criminals and they find the towns to be wicked, evil places, which is why they call Coventry, their village, their sanctuary from evil.<br /><br />When Lucious tries his theory, that the creatures will sense his good nature and let him pass through the woods, the creatures wreak havoc through the village. They put red marks on all the doors and upset the living quarters in every home. They leave more dead, skinned animals behind as further chilling warnings not to penetrate the woods again. We see one of these creatures and wonder, ""what in the heck are these hideous things?!""<br /><br />We see about as many glimpses of the creature as we saw of the aliens in ""Signs,"" brief and just enough to scare you out of your drawers.<br /><br />Even if you catch on to the plot before the film comes to an end, you will still be entertained. The film is so well shot - every angle and reflection is so well-thought out - it is truly a work of art. As is his custom, Shyamalan gives himself a small cameo role, but unlike his cameo in ""Signs,"" it is so unobtrusive, you may not even notice him or think, ""when will this awkward scene be over?""<br /><br />There is not much more I can tell without spoiling the story - it will keep you guessing until almost the end. There are no sex scenes and there is no foul language, but there is mild violence. The PG-13 rating is appropriate, in my opinion."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	EVERYONE, STOP GIVING THE MOVIE 1 STAR BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL EDITION COMING OUT SOON. YOU'RE LOwERING THE AVERAGE SCORE.<br /><br />this is a good movie :( and i wish more people would say that without giving it one star because of no special features. it's stupid.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My three year old son just loved cars. Especially the opening racing sceen. Great family movie.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	A star is far too much for this pathetic movie.<br /><br />I wanted to leave after 5 minutes and then i hoped it would finish( it never did).<br /><br />It was like a butcher's stall; this movie is just about people cutting each other apart. Violence is omnipresent and valorised.<br /><br />The roles are stereotyped: all women are whores in sex-gear, and all men are brutal, pitiless drug-addicts that spend their time killing each other. It's not realistic: Dwight jumped from a building and didn't get hurt.<br /><br />There is no point because the movie is just a massacre so it's not entertaining or interesting.<br /><br />This movie is only a waste of time and money.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	WATCHING 3 KIDS GOING CAMPING IN HD IS A TERRIFIC  EXPERIENCE.  TRULY BRINGS THE MOVIE INTO NEAR REALITY.  GREAT MOVIE SERIES TO BEGIN WITH.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"Ben Stein WISHES he could produce an inflammatory propaganda film with one-tenth the quality of his couterparts on the left. He can't, and ""Expelled"" proves it. Lousy in every respect: research, direction, editing, lighting, narration...you name it. Stein's lame attempt to discredit *real* scientists through clever editing and documented deception is a comic failure.<br /><br />Anyone with a college education--or a reasonably good high school education--understands the mechanisms of natural selection. Those who are educated *and* religious usually have little difficulty accepting scientific truth along with their faith; some don't and, like Stein, choose instead to attack biology because it threatens their deeply held mythologies and superstitions.<br /><br />Stein's cinematic tripe isn't going to change anyone's mind about evolution or religion; content aside, though, it is a very poorly produced film, and it has certainly exposed Stein as a hack."

B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Sookie Stackhouse is your typical girl next door. She lives with her grandmother in a small Louisana town called Beau Temps where everything is seeminly normal. Normal until Bill Compton returns to town.<br />Strutting into the bar and grill Sookie works at she finds herself immediately drawn to Bill. Unfortunately for Bill his charms that Sookie is so drawn to doesn't sit well with the rest of the town for Bill is Beau Temp's very first vampire resident. Sookie quickly falls for him and thrusted into a river of troubles that runs way above her head.<br />A tale of sex, blood and murder this show will have you scratching your head as you try to figure out whats to come next. If you are a virgin to True Blood you are missing out. This show presents more action, more mystery and more spine tingling suspense than any show that has come out in the past five years.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"The plot of The Departed basically a question of ""find the mole."" Jack Nicholson plays Frank, the head of an Irish organized crime unit in Boston. His protege Colin, played by Matt Damon, has joined the police force and works as a detective. Not to save the world, mind you, but to fish out information for the mob and prevent Frank from being arrested. On the other side of the law is Billy Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Billy comes from a family who has a history of ties to the mob, but Billy wants to put that behind him and join the police force. His shady past, however, makes him a better candidate for being an undercover informant. So there you have it. Two moles on two different sides of the law. Who will catch who first?<br /><br />The Departed is visually stunning, as any Scorsese fan will tell you is to be expected, but besides that it's enthralling. The characters are richly drawn and the emotions run high in this crime drama/thriller. It's also a story with so many twists and turns it was hard to keep up. At several times I thought the movie was about to end and then, nope, here comes another twist and the story goes on. It was great and multi-faceted. I think anyone who likes well-planned crime capers, and films about organized crime will love The Departed. With its all star cast and big name director, I wouldn't have expected anything less than perfection. It's nice that I wasn't disappointed."
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	"I'm so dissapointed about it. I love all Indy movies, but this one, is far boring, unoriginal and in some parts, lame and stupid.<br /><br />I know it's all fiction, but all other films, while still worked around a story that in real life could just not happen, it's so entertaining that you still said ""why not"". But on this fourth movie, unreal crossed the line to impossible, and let me resume this thought in the following numbers:<br /><br />1.- Survive a nuclear blast, even inside a fridge... gimme a break!!!<br />2.- ""Loughing desert marsupials""???? Weren't the Ewoks enough for lucas on Episode VI? Compleately unfunny and unnecessary<br />3.- ALIENS!!!!! The story it's all around an alien skull... that, unoriginal idea for a Indy film, just was out of place.<br />4.- Special effects at the jeeps chase on the jungle... not only I got stressed out about this sequence, but standing on a jeep fighting and not falling at a speed over 60 mph... I guess cazy glue was an important issue here.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong it entertains, but this is not a type of movie that has no history behind it in order to do just anything. To Spielberg everything circles around aliens, but... come on, not Indy, that was just pushing it to far.<br /><br />It dissapointed me the fact of the unoriginality for the plot. It could have been a great movie. And everyone was so concerned about Fords age, why bother."
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	"See <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053TWVA0"">House II: The Second Story</a>for a more entertaining story about a crystal skull. Kingdom of the Crystal Skull isn't exciting and the plot is a failure of the imagination that did not connect with audiences. Yet again people were let down by mastermind of the Star Wars prequels. And Indiana is an old dog now. Old Baby Boomers like Lucas know how it is not having the energy for adventure and risk taking like they did 40 years ago. Time to settle down professor. So they marry him off to one of his former conquests and make him take care of his basterd, Mutt, played by the undeservedly big role landing Lebuff or however he spells it. Next Indiana will be in a retirement home and sort of rip-off the plot from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001LQJMQ"">Bubba Ho-Tep (Limited Collector's Edition)</a> and doing commercials like Dennis Hopper before he finally left the spotlight. Harrison Ford looks soo tired.<br />Actually Spielberg had much more to do with the creation of Indiana Jones and of course with the style and creation of the classic first film, Raiders of the Lost Arc, which made Indiana Jones a household name and movie icon. So Lucas gets unfair credit for Indiana Jones. Instead, when thinking of Lucas think <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWUWU8"">Howard the Duck</a>.<br />A resentful but filthy rich Lucas told Spielberg that people will call them a word that begins with the letter ""a"" and hate the movie... Now having the ability to predict his own future through his use of the Force the prophecy mostly came to pass.<br /><br />Some indulgent comments: I recall Quintin Tarantino saying directors do not improve with age and you have to think there is something to that. But no, this doesn't apply to the creator of Indiana Jones*. I'm not sure George Luca$ ever had much talent in the first place at this point. He was lucky! Imagine if they'd given him more money and he had better ""special effects"" technology... those movies weren't the movies Lucas wanted to make and he has repeatedly said so. And his least favorite is...The Empire Strikes Back. And Spielberg..well has he gotten better? I look forward to Spielberg's biopic of Lincoln with the great Daniel Day Lewis playing the part.."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I am way past the age group that this series was written for but I have read all of the books and see the videos as they become available and I like many love Harry and all of the other caracters involved.  This is a series that I wish could go on and on but there comes a point that it will lose its grip on the reader or watcher but I do<br />not feel that it has happened yet
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"This little movie tackles a big subject:  ""Why are so many marriages failing in spite of money, success and beauty?""<br />What's missing in many modern marriages is GOD.  God = Love. No God, no love.  It's a simple equation that served as the plot in an excellent story of a modern marriage in trouble.  The movie is fun to watch, exciting in places, a bit hokey in places, and overall a wonderful value as both entertainment as well as a lesson to us all."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"Loved it, true to form from the first movie. Hope a marriage and child comes. I will watch that one too! Suspenseful. Intriguing. From the beginning you had my attention as a child of the Great Wizard of Oz!  Loved the work here.  Bring on more but you have to step up the craft.  Don't use the same ol same old.  Stimulate and create what viewers have not seen yet.  Make another 8 to generate a series off of the ""Order of the Phoenix.""  Re-begin here and create lives of all of the original characters with Harry as the lead Dumbledore of the future with Dumbledore visiting Harry and Harry's family in spirit and as a guide.  I have great ideas for more if you would creat a future from here.  Loved the whole HP.  Can't wait to get my hands on the HP DH2.  Hermoine could take over the future McGonagil with McGonagil as lead headmistress.  Hagrid, well gee, no one can do another Hagrid.  He is just so cool and can not be reproduced.  But Hagrid and GiAnt could relate with future children as supporting actors and actresses.  Just keep it coming - don't let the storyline end here.  We need good examples of creative energy in film.  No one will ever do it again like Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Dumbledore, McGonagil, Hagrid and all of the little creatures.  They are awesome."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	this was a normal harry potter, the people are older but that the way it goes...all in all it was very good
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	We're not a fan of the genre but our son sure is. He really enjoyed the film and has thanked us profusely
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	My only regret is that I never saw this in theaters. This movie is great! It's really well paced, the characters seem thought out and the action... ah.. the action is fantastic! I love it all! GET IT!
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	Do not let the slip covers and giveaways fool you! This is the rushed version of the DVD! In a short time the 2 disk S.E. will be here with more extras than you will know what to do with!
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"To quote/paraphrase a line from the movie (no, this gives nothing away); ""my father created weapons in the hope that they would not have to be fired.  I respectfully disagree.  The best weapon is the kind you only have to fire ONCE.""<br /><br />All I had to do was see Iron Man once, and I was utterly hooked on it.  To further my impression of the movie before I plunge into the actual review, I will say this; I have seen the movie IN THEATRES five times.  I paid every single time, and not only that, I plan on buying the special edition disk set.  One hopes that will give you some indication of how good the movie really is for the diehard Marvel fan.<br /><br />I admit, I had my doubts.  It'd been a long time since I'd seen Mr. Downey Jr in a film, and Ms. Paltrow as well, come to think of it.  I've been suffering through renditions of how directors and producers saw Spider-Man, assiduously avoiding The Fantastic Four franchise because I didn't want to see the F4 being mutilated along with the Silver Surfer...but Iron Man completely restored my faith in a director's ability to cut through the ""SPECIAL EFFECTS FIGHT SCENES MAKE THE MOVIE!"" crap that so many directors of today suffer from, most fatally.<br /><br />Mr. Downey Jr BECOMES Tony Stark, brilliant alcoholic multi-millionaire.  He is so believable that when I bring him up in conversation, I don't say ""Mr. Downey Jr was great in that scene,"" I saw ""wow, Tony did really well right there!""  He submerged himself and became, instead of simply acted, his role.  It was beautiful to watch.  It is rare than an actor of Mr. Downey Jr's considerable talent finds a role that suits him so perfectly, that allows him to be so expressive, that makes him truly become one of the best actors of this decade, if not this generation.<br /><br />I could easily wax more eloquent on the abilities of Mr. Downey Jr, but that would defeat the purpose of this review, so I will continue.  Simply put, the plot of this movie and the origins of Iron Man synchronize without rough edges, and the characters are utterly believable humans with human motives and flaws.  The actors and actresses in this movie are flawless and the dialogue is engaging and humorous.  This movie is well worth the money to own, or in my case, to see five times and then proceed to ownership.  Give it a try!  You will not regret it."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Overall, Iron Man is the best two-disc package available on Blu-ray. The film is fun, the audio is mighty impressive and I can't in good conscience fault the video quality enough to deduct points. It may not be the most detailed picture I've ever seen, but I believe that could easily be accounted for by the camera work and CGI integration. Robert Downey, Jr. does a great job and the special effects give Iron Man a fresh, unique vibe that sets it apart from most action or superhero films. There are enough surprises and plot twists to keep any audience on their toes; enough humor to keep any audience laughing; enough character development to satisfy the critics and stark nerds; and enough effects and action to get the adrenalin rush thru our bodies. Iron Man gets my highest recommendation on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Now this is what you get for the BD version:<br /><br />Blu-ray Disc 1:<br /><br />Hall of Armor<br />The Invincible Iron Man Origins<br />Friends & Foes<br />The Definitive Iron Man<br />Demon in a Bottle<br />Extremis and Beyond<br />Ultimate Iron Man<br />Deleted/Extended Scenes<br />BD Live: Iron Man IQ<br /><br />Blu-ray Disc 2:<br /><br />I Am Iron Man The Journey Begins<br />The Suit that makes the Iron Man<br />The Walk of Destruction<br />Grounded In Reality<br />Beneath the Armor<br />It's All in the Details<br />A Good Story, Well Told<br />Wired: The Visual Effects of Iron Man<br />Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test<br />The Actor's Process (scene rehearsal with cast)<br />The Onion ""Wildly Popular Iron Man Trailer to be Adapted into Full Length Film""<br />Theatrical Trailers<br />Image Galleries<br /><br />Overall 10 out of 10, this is how a superhero movie gets done and how a BD is made."
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"Simply put, this was a very entertaining movie.<br /><br />Despite the movie running a little long for an intense, action movie, overall it was still very interesting and fun to watch because the pacing was so good. Neither the action segments nor the lulls, the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but, frankly, what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a ""kids"" movie made today. Thankfully, that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent ""Transformers"" film I viewed.<br /><br />The scenes with ""Iron Man"" a.k.a. ""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance, catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot, piloted by the corporate bad guy ""Obadiah Stane"" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see, too.<br /><br />Some complain the film is not really all that ""smart"" and it's a bit too predictable, but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters.  And.....it looks fantastic on Blu-Ray."
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	Although the photographic style shows originality, some of the violent scenes were fun, and the actors did a good job, the story is boring.  By the time the movie was almost over, I was waiting for relief from watching this stinker.  When it was over, the only satisfaction came from not having paid movie theater prices for the entire family.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull; This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat with action every second.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is absolutely amazing!  I have watched this DVD over and over and laugh just as hard each time!!  He's the best!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	If you have never heard of Jeff Dunham, you owe it to yourself to get one of his DVDs, they will make you cry with laughter.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Part of the fun of watching the Harry Potter films is watching the actors and the tone of the films age. Columbus created two cheery, mildly dark films that are fun yet candy-coated. Cuaron had a darker style and brought his actors into more mature form with a tighter faster-paced story. Newell showed the trio as the teenagers they've become while Yates created the first truly adult Harry Potter experience. I've read all the books and while I'm disappointed with some of the cuts I must say they've done wonderfully in capturing the spirit of the books. Order of the Phoenix is arguably the best in the series so far. Harry's become isolated and it's meant to be a darker story so I don't see the complaints on this end.  It may not be as magical as the previous entries but neither was the book! Anyway, I highly recommend this film for Potter fans and simply casual film goers. It really shows how well the series is maturing and bridges the gap for the next two installments.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	By far the best Marvel comic hero movie yet.  Yes, even better than Spiderman.  A must-see for any Marvel comics fan...
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"I went into the theater with a smile on my face and left with one, too. Sure there are a few moments in there that I could do without, but when you look at the big picture, KotCS is a damned good film. I've since seen it three more times, and it doesn't get boring for me. It's almost non stop action.<br /><br />I feel like this movie gets unfairly treated by an audience that not so much dislikes it, but outright refuses to accept its extra-terrestrial plot. For some reason, we can accept that a giant pillar of flame and smoke can melt a bunch of nazi's faces and then whisk them away to heaven or hell, or that a man can pull out another man's heart and have that man still live while being lowered into a pit of lava. However, we refuse to accept the possibility of alien life and its possible influence of early man and his view of ""who your god is"".<br /><br />Another complaint I hear alot is that the CGI is ""bad"". Watch the 2nd disc and you'll see that, save for the ending, a majority of the action was done on giant sets with real stunt men. They actually built that entire retracting stairwell near the end. It's pretty cool.<br /><br />Another gripe is ""Ford looks too old."" Are you even watching the movie? Of course he's older! They go out of their way to tell you that. He's even referred to as ""old man"" more than once by Mutt. Lucas and Spielberg did the smart thing and made that his character. Indy's getting on in years, and things aren't what they used to be. It was a conscious decision to make Ford play Indy much more like Connery played his father in The Last Crusade.<br /><br />So is KotCS a ""great"" movie? No, its not my favorite of the series, and it wasn't even my favorite flick of the year, but god damned is it a good film. For me, it has held up to multiple viewing. I think KotCS will eventually be seen for what it is over the years: a lighthearted, action packed adventure with awesome visuals and sound, a great cast of characters, and yes a solid story."
B000H7I6CU	3.0	b	"I really wanted to love ""Cars"" when it came out! Trust me, I did. While many think I may be cold and emotionless and it's quite unfashionable to be critical of this movie, I had actually been incredibly impressed by Pixar's track record prior to this film. ""Toy Story,"" ""Finding Nemo,"" and ""The Incredibles"" are all film I would have rated among the best in their respective years. And ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" are astute crowd pleasers that tug at your heartstrings.<br /><br />But, alas, I was a bit let down with ""Cars."" It's not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It just might have been a tad too calculated for its own good, and for the first time--the emotion seemed too manufactured. I never cared about the plight of our automobile friends in the same way as I did for the toys, the fish and the superhero family. With a plot as obvious as this, so linear and expected in every way--maybe the movie's heart never connected with me because their was no ""real"" drama or surprise. Everything proceeds just as you know it will.<br /><br />""Cars"" is a great looking movie as you would expect. The visuals are fun and colorful. The soundtrack is great--the sound effects and ambient music are crisp and spot on. Layering in known songs like ""Life Is A Highway"" actually enliven the film far more than the few original tunes that unfortunately play as cliche. The cast is game. Owen Wilson's distinctive voice lends great amusement and Paul Newman is terrific. There are moments of genuine humor and great laughs--come on, tractor tipping is classic.<br /><br />Then why, oh why, am I so apathetic about this film? Ultimately, I've just seen this formula before--it's too predictable. Is it still a movie worth seeing? Sure. Might the kids love it? Sure. But it's missing the heart and genuineness of Pixar's earlier works. Oh, it still has all the emotional elements in place--but here they just don't ring true. Never once, after viewing ""Cars,"" did I remember it fondly. It was gone just as soon as I'd seen it. Pleasantly entertaining in the now, ""Cars"" just doesn't have the same enduring appeal as I'd have liked. KGHarris, 11/06."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My family (2 girls, 1 boy, myself, and my wife) love this film.  Product was in excellent condition.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I saw this on Comedy Central and laughed until I cried.  Jeff is amazingly talented, and each character has a distint personality.  This is definitely the funniest thing I've seen in years, and I'm going to order the DVD so I can see it over and over again.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	This was a well told story, with excellent acting and enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat, but from start to finish, this movie is loaded with violence, so much so that I actually had nightmares after watching it.<br /><br />Outstanding performances were given by Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss who stumbles upon a drug deal gone bad, also by Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell, and Kelly MacDonald as Llewelyn's wife. However, of special note was the Academy Award worthy performance by Javier Barden who absolutely personified evil as Anton Chigurh, the cruel, sociopath with his own twisted sense of honor, hired as an assassin to recover the stolen drug money.<br /><br />You won't get very far into the film before you begin to lose count of the murders, and the bloodbath continues for about two hours in high def blu-ray clarity. It's a bit overwhelming.<br /><br />I almost gave this a rating of 3 stars due to the extensive violence, but the acting was so well done I had to bump it up to 4.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	The show was a great remake of show white with many different changes that I didn't mine. The effects of the movie were astounding. A little bloody but it was great!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Amazing. The bastions of science argue with epithets, assertion, and bombast to uphold their steel rational logical conclusions without evidence to the contrary. Talk about self serving reviewers - they might as well be Captains lecturing on navigation as the ship sinks. The passionate outbursts of emotion only show these 'scientists' protest too much - and at the expense of freedom of speech.<br />Good for Ben Stein!!
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	this is just my opinon, but it was not as good as the awards it received. i don't get why javier got the oscar; he didn't cry or laugh or even get angry. i'm guessing it takes skill to pull off his character, but i don't see the oscar worthy performance. reminds me of denzel getting it for training day but not for the hurricane and russell crowe getting it for gladiator and not for a beautiful mind. i guess it was the movie of the time and the acadamy had to give him something for them liking the coens so much. i haven't read the book, but i'm guessing its better than the movie? i also saw the movie all the prety horses and also didn't like that movie. maybe it's just me, but at least those 2 books weren't supposed to be transferable to the screen. i personally don't like the bad guys getting away with anything either. i actually liked it when robert dinero gets killed by al pacino in heat; to me, that is the way movies should end, even though in real life, real killers, pedophiles, and rapists sometimes get away with it.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	The photography and the performance of the new star, Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy, are absolutely great. The plot is mildly surprising but isn't particularly full of intrigues. Many, me included, might feel actually a bit cheated as the much awaited &quot;truth&quot; is finally revealed near the end. It's not because the story as a whole is bad; but it's because of the way the movie is marketed, of what we have come to expect from a Shyamalan movie, and most importantly of Shyamalan's misplaced focus in most of the movie.<br /><br /> Give the same story to other directors, I am sure most likely most would prefer to treat it as essentially a drama and accordingly downplay the &quot;mysterious&quot; elements in the plot. It's actually a shame that what could have been a beautiful movie (the romance part of the story and the stunning visuals) was unfortunately turned into a mystery that cheats, and a horror flick that offers only empty scares.<br /><br /> The gothic atmosphere created in the first two thirds of the movie is great. I felt totally engrossed, and couldn't wait to be led to find out the &quot;truth.&quot; But disappointingly, this first part of the movie promises far much more than what the story could subsequently deliver (in short, the movie cheats). Since nothing great, in terms of the revelation of the &quot;truth,&quot; is in store, and I cannot help wondering why the director seems totally happy to build up the audience's hope in the first place. To me, it almost feels like dishonest tease.<br /><br /> &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; has most of its story independent of the movie's final surprise. So even if some smart audience thinks the twist is predictable and cheap, they would not feel cheated and question the integrity of the movie. The surprise is an extra treat and something that gives the movie an additional rich layer of texture. But &quot;The Village,&quot; &quot;Unbreakable&quot; and to smaller extent &quot;Signs&quot; all have their stories orbit around their respective &quot;twists.&quot; And unfortunately those twists are not all that satisfying, hence rendering those movies neither refreshing nor extremely likable.<br /><br /> With his tremendous craftsmanship in creating atmosphere and the movie's great cast, I believe &quot;The Village&quot; would have been a much better piece should Shyamalan have not sacrificed the focus on the dramatic elements in favor of the disappointingly empty mystery. In fact, I find myself enjoying the movie most in the last half hour of the movie after the &quot;twist&quot; has been revealed.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	The greatest thing about `Cars,' the latest film coming from Pixar, is its rich and beautiful colors of the picture. Even those who points out the weakness of the story (which resembles that of Michael J. Fox film `Doc Hollywood') would admit the merit. After all, you just cannot keep telling good stories with originality forever, and Pixar is no exception. In `Cars' the respected company has decided on seeking the originality in another direction, that is, the setting of the film, in which all the characters are really cars, trucks, or any vehicle you can see on the road.<br /><br />That means you don't see any humans here. The hero of the film is Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), hot shot race car who is stranded in the middle of nowhere, a sleepy town called Radiator Springs, after a series of incredible but funny misadventures. After damaging the town's main road, he is sentenced to community service in the court by Doc Hudson (voice by Paul Newman) while Lightning has to be in the next big race in California.<br /><br />The town's `people' or cars are mostly misfits and rejects - the motif frequently used in Pixar films - and corky Lightning finds the life there miserable and hellish, but you know, people, no, cars change.<br /><br />The film's idea about the cars and other vehicles is stretched to the point of some bizarre scenes - such as groupie cars, public restroom for cars, or car bugs that really fly - and you may not be impressed by all of them. Unlike `The Incredibles' or `Monster's Inc' the script of `Cars' is not the most original one in the marvelous history of Pixar, and the film's length (about 2 hours) makes us wish for the year 1995 when Pixar managed to make `Toy Story' that runs only 81 minutes and still is as good and enjoyable.<br /><br />Still brilliant images full of striking colors and wonderful designs would appeal to everyone. The speedy car race sequences are brilliantly done, and the designs of the deserted town of Radiator Springs are often astonishingly real. And in spite of the weak story, the characters themselves are all well-written and likable, as those in the previous Pixar films are. Maybe `Cars' failed to reach the high standard of recent animations that Pixar has been pushing higher and higher, but it is still entertaining with a bit of sentimental and nostalgic feeling.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I ordered this blu-ray/DVD/digital copy on Nov 7, and afterwards saw the reviews that pointed out that Amazon was still showing a photo that indicated a digital copy, but that it expired Sept 13.  Mine did include a digital copy code, and when I tried to redeem it, I received this message from the WB website:<br /><br />Thank you for submitting your request.<br />You will receive your Digital Copy disc in 2 weeks<br /><br />So, I'm hopeful that it might work when it comes.<br /><br />If not, it is not too hard to turn a DVD into a digital copy with Handbrake.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"I think poor reception of ""The Village"" lies with expectations.  Too many patrons expected one thing and were severed something quite different -- hence the massive let-down that incurs.<br /><br />Part of the problem lies with incessant comparison to Shyamalan's preceding films.  Watch this one anew.  Fresh.  Not expecting it to turn up like a carbon copy of ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs""... never mind ""Unbreakable"", that was awful to begin with.<br /><br />Another contributing factor to the film's less-than-appropriate, sub-par rating is the film's improper promotion.  It was promoted as a sort of horror film, when in actuality it is a film about people, and the extremes we might take to content ourselves.  The previews built the film up into a kind of chill-fest, when what we got once the film was over is a chill of a different kind.<br /><br />""The Sixth Sense"" was scary.  The film featured ghosts.  It was supernatural, and thrilling.  ""Signs"" also hinged on thrill and awe, mystery and fright to achieve it's success.  So no wonder that repeat Shyamalan audiences would expect the same,  legitimate frights.<br /><br />The film fell from its deserving grace due to the tremendous success of its creator, and audience-grabbing promotion.  The previews and trailors for the film are false, clashing, and unfortunately deceiving.  The film suffered from it's own image.<br /><br />Such a shame, because it's brilliant.<br /><br />Grade: A+"
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This comedian is the BEST. We have seen him in person, but now to have the opportunity to watch whenever is great. I would highly recommend this as a Must Have!
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	If film technology had existed at the time of Copernicus, then  the Catholic Church would have made a movie similar to Expelled to convince people the sun revolves around the Earth.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	I could enjoy this movie in August 2004 when I visited the US for pleasure. I just made the decision to enter the cinema with no previous references. This is not a film which can be easily set into a group; it is a love story, a hero (Ivy's) history but with a touch of suspense, far from grotesque special computerized effects, no spectacular action scenes but a superb performance by actors. Everything falls into place at last. Of course I did not know many actors but they made the film work, and work fine.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"Where do I begin?  All others have posted really good reviews.  I plan to recommend this movie to as many people as I can.  At least then they can't say ""I didn't know that""<br />I'm not sure if I'm more disappointed in the government for their support in this or disgusted in what I have been eating all these years.<br />A patent on soybeans???  Really???<br />I will definitely be reading and watching more about this topic.  Also making more conscious food decisions starting today!"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I have HBO, but only caught bits and pieces of it on the channel. If a show gets enough positive buzz, I make the leap of faith and buy it on DVD or blu-ray for the extras. I enjoyed it so much that I watched the series in record time -- and it would have been faster had I not made a commitment to watch it with my husband. He really enjoyed it too, he just doesn't have my ability to completely OD on a show. True Blood is very good at cliffhangers and that pretty much compels you to watch the next episode right away.<br /><br />The show is definitely adult and every episode is packed with adult themes and activities. (While Sookie and Bill the vampire head towards greater intimacy at a fast pace, the show still milks the slightest reason to break them up, like any show.) It's nice to wrest the vampire them away from children and teenyboppers, although they probably watch this too, yeah? The concept is supposed to be dark, sexy, dangerous, and wrong. The dark humor is also welcome.<br /><br />I've watched the commentary for the pilot featuring Alan Ball -- pretty good -- but no other commentaries so far. The shows also feature an option for enhanced viewer. What this means -- and it is meant for subsequent viewings, but the show is rewatchable -- is that maps pop up to show you where the characters live, facts and hints are given, and Lafayette (a character on the show) pops in to give you some gossip or wisdom. It was an interesting way to make the world seem even more real and to fill in back story.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of the vampire myth, dark humor, the occasionally cringe-worthy moment, and the demented sensibilities of Alan Ball (Six Feet Under.) And, of course, for fans of the Charlaine Harris books.<br /><br />(I watched on my PS3 with no issues.)
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	I saw this movie in the theater and had high hopes for it.  I like Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth and although I'd heard bad things about Kristen Stewart's acting, I'd never seen any movie she was in so I was hopeful that perhaps rumors of her poor acting had been exaggerated.  Sadly, they were not.  She was truly awful and if this woman is supposed to inspire a kingdom with her beauty and charm, I just didn't see it.  And although she may have had an affair with the director, the editor clearly didn't see it either and she had a very limited speaking role.  Most of her part involved being silent and expressing emotion non-verbally, of which she seems incapable.  Unfortunately, even Charlize Theron, who I hoped would save the film, was awful in this.  Her Queen tended to drone, with every word overly-enunciated as if spoken by a high school thespian.  I think this was supposed to give her character gravitas but instead it gave the impression of overacting.  Chris Hemsworth was good as a man haunted by the death of his wife but even he could not convince me that Snow White was worth believing in.  Plus, as others have mentioned,**SPOILER ALERT***the fact that his kiss awakened Snow White was a plot twist that made zero sense.**END SPOILER ALERT**  I cannot possibly imagine what in this movie was inspiring enough to spawn the apparently impending Snow White and the Huntsman 2, but this is one moviegoer who learned her lesson the first time.  Fool me once, after all.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	I love this movie,of course not scary as i expected it would be when i rented it.But this movie did not disappointed me , it was great with alot of romance and even poetic scenes.In some scenes it even made me cry( not really).Thought the climax was a little silly.But i guess this is a must buy.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Expelled is so fallacious and manipulative that I felt insulted after watching it.  All I can say is that if you don't see through the complete lack of arguments, inconsistency and appeals to irrational emotion, just read the wikipedia pages for Intelligent Design and Expelled.<br /><br />Freedom of inquiry in science does not require scientists to accept every crackpot non-scientific theory cooked up by a right wing think tank (which is exactly what ID is.  Again, do a bit of research).  The reason Expelled makes no real arguments about why ID is science is because there are no arguments to be made!  The reason scientists act as if the debate about evolution has been settled is that it has!<br /><br />ID is fine for philosophy classes and such, but it's not science because it isn't empirically testable, isn't falisfiable, hasn't produced any productive research, etc.  There's no vast conspiracy of scientists, the media and atheists that is keeping ID out of science.  It does that on its own.
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	After the extended cuts presented in volumes 1 and 2 of the ultimate edition releases (which are indeed the only reasons I began collecting the ultimate editions), volumes three to six are incredibly disappointing. If you do not own the films, or do not own them on blu-ray, the ultimate editions may be worth purchasing and for this I am giving it an extra star beyond the first. However, the precedent set in the first 2 releases leaves this one so incredibly disappointing that I feel I was cheated out of my money when I ordered volumes 3-6 to watch before the DH2 premiere.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Go see this movie! Robert D. Jr IS Stark,Paltrow is great,and Terrence Howard WILL be War Machine in the sequels(my prediction).<br />Stay after the final credits to see more of the movie! WORTH IT!!!<br />Now I'm waiting for either the extended version or the directors cut on DVD!! :o)
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This was a great movie for the grandkids.  They watched it over and over again.  Got them ready for cars 2.  Great choice for the kids and parents too.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"First I must tell the editor who wrote the review that I personally don't think any Latin guy who understands English will not laugh his guts out watching this. I was born in Cuba, and I am way beyond that ""politically correct cr@@p"". Although I would suggest one thing: next time any guy out there talks about us Cubans, please remember two things: 1) No, we DO NOT consume chili, jalapenos or whatever (that is a MEXICAN custom, not Cuban) and 2) We have no idea back in Cuba what a taco is. In fact, that for us, means a completely different thing; and a tortilla for us is an omelet, not some floury thing that, by the way, we again DO NOT know anything about back there. But then, enough of that, and let's give a huge round of applause for this guy. He is simply BRILLIANT. And for those of you Latin guys who go: ""Oh this is wrong, politically incorrect.."" I would say, get a freaking life!!!"
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography by David McCullough, ""John Adams"" takes an in-depth look at the life of the title character, and his role in the first fifty years of the United States. From his time as a Boston lawyer, to his death on the Fiftieth Anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the life of John Adams and his wife, Abigail, are told with powerful drama and epic sweep.<br />While the story itself is a bit slow at times (the film could definitely have used some additional music than was there), it is overall very powerful, with dramatic renditions of the events that shaped our nation. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney both give brilliant performances as John and Abigail Adams, piercing the soul of these dynamic characters. Tom Wilkinson is fascinating as Benjamin Franklin, while Stephen Dillane does a fine job as Thomas Jefferson. But the best supporting role is David Morse, who is surprisingly effective as George Washington, portraying him with great humility, along with occasional bouts of anger, in a performance that is deserving of an Emmy. Sarah Polley, Rufus Sewell and Danny Huston also give strong performances.<br />""John Adams"" is a remarkable miniseries that sheds light on one of the most fascinating characters of the American Revolution. Historians and non-historians alike will find much to enjoy in this epic look at one of the men who played a large role in the birth of our country.<br />Program/DVD Grade: A"
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"This is one of those movies where everyone talks really quiet, BUT THEN THE MUSIC'S SO LOUD!  I don't get why people always have to whisper in movies.  The magic mirror's not really a mirror, it's a gong.  I kept telling her, ""Bitch, that ain't no mirror!""  The queen's brother is seriously the biggest creeper I've ever seen in a movie.  There's one scene where Kristen Stewart's running away, and she happens to find a magically convenient horse, and she's like, ""Hey, can I ride you?"" and the horse is like, ""Sure.""  In another scene, she staves off a troll attack by batting her eyes at it.  The fairy forest is pretty awesome, I'd like to live there.  Oh, and there's ass-kicking dwarves.  No really, the dwarves are in this movie!<br /><br />Anyway.....it's a good movie.  The way it's advertised, you'd think it's just for teenagers, but that's not necessarily the case.  The romance is mostly a minor plot point, it's not overly sappy or anything.  A lot of people will immediately hate this movie just cause it has the Twilight chick in it.  They'll say, ""Oh my God, that person's existence is so untrendy!""  To them, I say grow up, it's not that big of a deal.  Basically, it's a spookier, more adult-ish version of the story.  If you're into that kind of imagery(I am), then you should like this movie.  If not, then you might like it anyway.  Give it a chance.  Don't just say, ""Oh, it's too gothic, it has Twilight lady in it!"" cause then you're attacking your own intelligence.  My only real complaint is that it's maybe a bit too long.  There's nothing mind-blowing about this movie, but it's all good fun.  Worth a rental at least.<br /><br />Of course, this movie begs the question...if you were friends with Snow White, what would you call her?  Snow?  Whitey?  I would call her Whitey."
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" - the fifth Harry Potter film - is the most sombre and subdued so far.<br /><br />It has the usual stunning special effects but there is more a focus on the characters especially Harry Potter himself who is beginning to understand the burden he bears.<br /><br />JK Rowling and the film-makers continue to successfully create a parallel magical universe for us to explore.<br /><br />Dolores Umbridge (played by Imelda Staunton) is right up there with other Potter villains playing a smug Margaret Thatcher-like matron sent to tidy up Hogwarts.<br /><br />Harry Potter's first screen kiss plays a very small part in the film and his relationship with Cho Chang is never explored.<br /><br />This is not really a film for little kids but fans of the series will not be disappointed."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Very intense thriller, no time to be bored, this movie needs no special effects to keep you on your toes!. Oscar winner what does that say? Buy it now. Blue ray rocks!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I have been shopping on Amazon for years and have bought countless products from them.. and never have i ever felt the need to write a review.  Nothing has been either good enough or bad enough for me to have an opinion that I just NEED to share.  I guess there's always a first.<br /><br />I bought Insanity after watching the informercial even though I never really trusted them.  Insanity seemed simple and true enough: no gimmicks, no fancy contraptions, just PURE HARD WORK and u'll get the body you've always wanted.  I am getting married in a few months, so i figured hey why not give it a shot.<br /><br />I've been fairly fit.. playing competitive sports from middle school all the way to varsity.  I had a two year stint in the Army after college as well.. though i have to admit, the past two years, i've been going to the gym way to little and not eating healthy.. my fitness level though decent is no where near fit.<br /><br />Onto the product:  Insanity Works.  plain and simple.  The first week was quite shocking.. half way through the fit test and i realized how truly out of shape i was.  wheezing, coughing and lying in a pool of my own sweat, i questioned if i had the will to continue.  Just going through the warmup (Shaun T makes you do a circuit of about 7 exercises repeated 3 times without stopping) was a real challenge.<br /><br />Somehow i survived and by the second week, i was feeling much better, being able to go through the whole dvd stopping only occasionally.  By the second fit test, i was feeling good, my results showing a drastic improvement.<br /><br />By the end of the first month, I was feeling fit and healthy, i dropped 6 kgs and 3.5 inches off my waist, and EVERYONE noticed how much leaner i've become.<br /><br />Recovery Week:  Don't let the title fool you.. recovery week is not easy!  Although they are not the same intensity as the regular exercises, they will make you sweat!<br /><br />So.. I just completed the first day of Phase Two and OH MY GOD.  Shaun T kicks it at least 5 gears higher and pushes you to the max.  It doesnt help that the first day of phase 2 includes a fit test AND a max interval training (team beachbody should consider changing this!), but I feel like I've started all over again.  Phase Two workouts are ONE HOUR each and will absolutely destroy you.<br /><br />So here I am writing this review with my arms barely working.. I am spent, exhausted, still pouring sweat but excited.. if the first day can make me feel like this, i can't wait to see the results at the end of the month.<br /><br />Apologies for the rant.. believe me when i say this.  Insanity IS THE BOMB.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"i have been awaiting for this movie to come out for 2 decades! i have been a fan of Iron Man since the learned to read comics! I really enjoyed the ""other"" version i watched this move in. However i knew this would be a definite Bluray addition to my Marvel Bluray universe.  I actually had gotten eh Sound track first and was just too excited about the movie.<br /><br />I felt Robert Jr. really came through and the role of Tony Stark just fitted him like a glove. Well done!  the story of course is sort of leading up to something just like the incredible Hulk.  But definitely a must have bluray for any HD and comics fan!"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I received the item fast and in great condition.<br /><br />Love the series and can't wait to buy the next season on amazon. Great price and great item. Enough said.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Memories are made of all these things. This is a masterpiece by Steven Spielperg, the only movie of the Indiana Jones series that can match the Raiders of the lost arc, the only one that successfuly transmits the spirit of adventure mixed with the nostalgia of a paradise lost, all present in the earlier Steven Spielberg films, the ones that weren't serious enough, the ones that were supposed to be just fun. By returning to his most famous hero, Spielberg goes back in time and unravels all his memories of an era that considers his own: the communist fear, the atomic bomb, the rock' n' roll, all slide gently in a film of great wisdom, where the old generation gives his place to the new generation, and where Spielberg is the father and the child for once. After experiencing an excellent but also deliberately old fashioned adventure, there comes the closing time: the hat that flies, the young one that holds it in his hands, and the old one that takes it back because it is HIS hat. The young one, if he wants, may go and make something of his own. This could be the last Stieven Spielberg film (I don' t say that it will be), a great farewell to us all, to all these things that memories are made of, to the world, and after this Indiana Jones passes to immortality. For the sake of all things we once loved: Indiana Jones for ever!
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	Iron-Man doesn't mess it up when it could have been easy to do so and Robert Downey Jr is on top form in a story about him being a multi-billionaire weapons tycoon who finds his products used against Americans and so develops an Iron-Man suit to combat Muslim terrorists that kidnapped him, killed his friend and tried to use his technology in ways that he didn't foresee. Things go from bad to worse when he finds his company has been double-dealing and business partners have turned bad.<br /><br />In short Iron-Man is Robocop for young adults but Downey Jr actually puts on a worthwhile performance that overshadows when he puts on the suit. Even with the suit on the flying through the sky moments are well worth the wait and while the fights and finale are kept on a somewhat small scale they are still good.<br /><br />Overall Iron-Man delivers on an interesting balance of action and content. If you like quality superhero movies then you can't go wrong with this.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"This movie is destined to become a Christmas classic for all ages. The effects, narration, and the very overall integrity of this movie lends itself to ""classic"" status. We took our grandchildren (their first visit to the movie theater ever) and they were totally enthralled with the movie. Finally, someone has put out a product that all ages can enjoy without fear of some adult themes creeping into a scene etc. If you want to turn back the hands of time in your own life, or you just want to enjoy a Christmas movie with your family and friends, then by all means, please, get this movie. I'm 51 years old, and you can bet that when this becomes available, I'm buying this movie!"

B001KZG99A	2.0	b	Dear Amazon,<br /><br />You sold me this product stating that it is new. I must say that there is no way that this product is new. I worked with the 2nd largest video/dvd chain and know DVD packaging when it is new. The shrinkwrap is not tight, there are no labels on the video, no security label, nothing. So come on Amazon. You repackaged this and sold it for new huh?<br /><br />I have to say I am dissapointed and embarrased that we gave it as a gift and it looked used....<br /><br />Tell me how this happened?<br /><br />Thank you.
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"First: the sets and special effects are beautiful, so praise goes to the artists and tech creators. That said: Humans this stupid would not have lived to carry their genes into space! And except for the robot, the inarticulate actors chosen as ""scientists"" would have been better cast as members of a futuristic motorcycle gang. Someone else (one star) has gone to great lengths to detail the scientific stupidity of the script. Why, when the filmmakers obviously had a gigantic budget to work with, did they scrimp on professional consultation? Prometheus could have been intelligent and thought-provoking - even moving - were it not for the ignorant script writers. It's pretty hard movie to sit through without cursing at the screen if one is a natural scientist or archeologist (as i am), as none of the basic protocols are followed - or even the dictates of basic common sense! In spite of all this, I thought the movie's premise was exciting and fun, and I even liked it overall by what I thought was a rather graceful end. But hold on! Scott (?) just couldn't resist a final, totally gratuitous, gross scene - proving that all these years as a director have brought little maturity."

B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is the funniest comedian! You can watch this over and over. Jeff is so talented. His characters are unforgettable. It has both a censored & uncensored version so all ages can enjoy. You won't regret buying this video.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	"For a 21-year-old, it's been a long time since I believed in Santa. It was getting a bit stupid when I got told Santa didn't come down the chimney in our house (as we didn't have a chimney), he came in through the front door, which my parents left unlocked for him. OK then. And my mum always left out sherry for Santa, which she would then drink. And I get freaked out by these people who dress up as Santa to entertain the kids. He's not real. Does that mean I'm not going to get any presents this year? No. Cos they're sitting upstairs that's why.<br /><br />But for me, this film made me feel like I should still believe in the big Mr C, simply because of the magical, sweet ending. It meant so much, and showed how much you have grown up when you watch it. Just a simple thing like a bell ringing means you believe in Santa or you don't.<br /><br />I'm always a bit iffy around animated movies, simply because now I'm older, I notice the lip synch doesn't match etc. But I didn't notice it here. And in fact it was so well done, that I actually felt like I was watching a real movie with real actors. Also, it had all the classic 'moments' from cartoons in there. You never saw adults' faces and no one is given really proper names.<br /><br />Tom Hanks does a lot of the voices, and is the characters in this, and it's absolutely amazing how they managed to pick up his facial expressions. The animated character(s) even look like Tom Hanks. He voices these characters: Hero Boy, Father, Conductor, Hobo, Scrooge, and Santa Claus. I didn't really get the character of the Hobo, I thought he was originally going to be Santa, but he appears & disappears. That was really the only character I wasn't sure about. And Eddie Deezen also voices the know-it-all kid, who appeared in Grease, as wait for it, a geek!!! Even the kid looks pretty similar to how he did in Grease, just with lighter hair.<br /><br />There's a lot of bits relating to Robert Zemeckis' other big film Back To The Future. In a news photo of Santas on strike, their placards say they're picketing Lone Pine Mall. Hero Boy says, ""I've wanted to do that my whole life,"" after tugging on the trains whistle. This is the same thing Doc Brown says.<br /><br />The score is also magical, and has one of those memorable cues, that sounds so much like Edward Scissorhands, you'll actually think it was. It's a brilliant score by Alan Silvestri.<br /><br />It's a shame it's a Christmas movie, as it's so magical, it could be watched at anytime, but the obvious references to Santa etc, kinda means it can only be watched once a year. I can't wait for next year to watch it again. This will definitely be a film you'll watch year after year."
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	A lot of publicity (hype).<br />Terrible sound quality ... No equalization ...Had to increase volume while talking and decrease during music and action.<br />Terrible unintelligible accents made it difficult to follow plot.<br />Disjointed, like pieces of the movie were cut out.<br />Depended on visual effects. The only decent acting was presented by Charlize Theron (Evil Queen)<br />Overall, the most worthless movie I've rented since joining Amazon.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	He's been watching in every day for the past week and he LOVES, LOVES, LOVES it.  I would definitelly recommend it.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Everyone should see this. It is hilarious, you will fall out of your chair laughing! We had to stop the movie once so we could catch our breath and go back because we missed the next part! Get it, its worth it.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Both discs play great, couple very tiny scratches on them (doesn't hinder performance). Shipped without the slip cover, which is a bit of a bummer, but DEFINITELY not a deal breaker. Shipped and delivered in nine days, very sppedy!
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"My son and I went to see the the new Indiana Jones flick, and we both agreed that it was a fun film, and a good way for the series to end (if ending it indeed is).<br /><br />The real stars of the movie were Harrison Ford, who I think excels his other Indiana Jones performances here, Shia LeBeouf, who achieved a really good mix of adolescent tough-guyness and adolescent insecurity in the character Mutt (altho I can't quite see LeBeouf as the next Indiana Jones; he's just too baby-faced), and the Special Effects, which are really breath-taking (especially in the grand finale scene).  John Hurt has such a minimal role that his fantastic acting talent never gets a chance to get going, but Jim Broadbent, with an even smaller role, is brilliant.  Cate Blanchett vamps it well as a female Boris Badinoff.  The only real disappointment is Karen Allen's wooden performance (but in all honesty, it was her spunkiness rather than her acting ability that made her memorable in her previous Indiana Jones).  Most of her time is spent either shrieking at Indiana or swooning in lovestruck hero-worship.<br /><br />One of the cleverest aspects of the film involves the give-and-take barbs that Indie and the young Mutt trade:  a battle between youthful vigor and slower but wiser experience.  Mutt digs Indie about his age--""what are you,"" he asks at one point--""about eighty?!""--and Indie digs at Mutt because of his fear of nondangeous but scary scorpions.  They make a good team.<br /><br />I was glad to see Harrison Ford end his Indiana Jones career in this way.  It's a very respectacle way to make an exit."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This video was ordered as a gift.  It came in a timely manner, and it made my daughter very happy!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	After seeing Jeff in person I had to buy this DVD and was very pleased. It's laugh out loud funny and the out takes are great it's almost as good as being there live . Would highly recomend.
B001OHS8BQ	2.0	b	"I did not really like this movie and i did not like how the christian community as a whole gobbled up this movie as one of the best movies ever.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that the wife is not a very likeable charecter.  Ok the guy was into porn that was not good and in a marrage that can really mess things up. but then again he TRIED and TRIED and TRIED to go out of his way to work things out....and the woman still was cold to him and even considered cheating on him.<br /><br />The message basically is that men you have to roll over backwards for your wife.  I dont think this is a good message<br /><br />I think a marrage is a partnership and its not about men having to bow down to the wife it should be a partnership sure the guy was a little bit of a jerk at the beggining but he TRIED to change. I think only superman could have kept doing what he was doing and having his wife keep rejecting him<br /><br />Its really a biased and unrealistic look at what a marrage should be in all honestly i think the couple should have considered a divorce its clear the women only wanted him as long as he was Mr Perfect.  and only at the very last moment did she accept him after he did EVERYTHING EVERYTHING for her.<br /><br />So basically this movie is saying that Love is a man bowing down to a woman.  Im sorry I dont see that.<br /><br />and the problem is most christians are going to use this movie to cram down peoples throats (mostly this movie is directed at men) it was most likely a movie orginized by a bunch of church women in order to get their husbands to do what they want.<br /><br />I dislike this movie and if your a woman i am sure you will love this movie but youd have to be very shallow to not see how bias this movie is!<br /><br />I could have produced a better christian movie with one eye closed. This one is just preachy to the point of extreme<br /><br />why cant a christian movie be good without having to be overly preachy?<br /><br />Decent production values but you can still tell that the movie was not the greatest production wise<br /><br />and no offense with Cameras that can produce good cinematic video and independent films that really have great cinematic even with not a huge budget it would be nice if at least they had that.<br /><br />But to me it felt like a lowish budget ""preachy"" Christian movie."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"I can't imagine anybody else portraying Tony Stark better than Robert Downey Jr. I walked out of the theater at the end of the movie glad that the movie turned out so much better than expected...<br /><br />Full synopsis below:<br /><br />The movie begins with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) visiting soldiers on duty in the Middle East. He is joking with some members of a convoy who seem to be genuinely amused by his persona. Suddenly, the convoy is attacked. The soldiers fight to defend themselves but are quickly killed. Stark flees when a bomb (bearing the logo of his company, ""Stark Industries"") explodes, severely wounding Tony's chest. Tony is captured and recorded by a group of terrorists.<br /><br />A flashback sequence reveals Tony's history as a child prodigy before taking over his father's technology company at age 21. Colonel James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) attends a ceremony to present Tony Stark with an award for his work, but Stark is not in attendance. Tony's right-hand man (and his father's former partner) Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) accepts the award in Tony's honor. Rhody later finds Tony partying in a casino. On his way out, a reporter named Christine (Leslie Bibb) approaches Stark with some questions regarding the ethics of his weapons business. Stark deflects her questions with some swift quips and the two end up spending the night together.<br /><br />Next morning, Christine is awakened by a voice on a computer monitor. It's JARVIS, the artificial intelligence program responsible for running Tony's house. Christine is greeted by Tony's assistant, ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as she leaves the house. Pepper helps Tony catch up on some business before Tony heads out to the airport where his plane is kept.<br /><br />In flight, Tony talks with Rhody. Rhody is unhappy about Tony's lax attitude, and Tony tries to get his old friend to relax. Before long they are drunk and leering at the stewardesses.<br /><br />Tony arrives at a military outpost in the Middle East to demonstrate his company's latest project - the Jericho, a super-missile system. After the demonstration, Tony gets a phone call from Obadiah and they are both pleased that the demonstration went well. Tony goes off with the convoy that is soon attacked by terrorists.<br /><br />Much later, Tony regains consciousness in a cave. His chest is hooked up to a strange device. Another captive, named Yinsen (Shaun Tomb), explains that he operated on Stark but was unable to remove all the shrapnel fragments from the bomb blast. Yinsen created a device - essentially a battery-powered magnet - that will keep the remaining fragments out of Tony's heart.<br /><br />The terrorists who captured Tony & Yinsen enter the room. Yinsen translates; they want Tony to build them a Jericho missile. Tony refuses, so they begin to torture Stark.<br /><br />Hours later, the terrorists show off a huge stockpile of weapons-all made by Stark Industries. Tony appears to relent and start building the missile, but has other plans. With Yinsen's help, Tony constructs a tiny version of an arc reactor, streamlined from a much bigger design used at his company's headquarters. The power output is enough to run Stark's heart for fifty lifetimes... or something much bigger for about 15 minutes.<br /><br />Tony designs a way out for them - a powered weapon suit that he will wear and use to defeat the terrorists. Midway through construction, the head of the terrorist group (The Ten Rings), a man named Raza (Faran Tahir) arrives and attempts to torture Yinsen, angry because he thinks Stark is not working on the Jericho as they wanted. Raza gives them one more day to finish.<br /><br />Working overnight, Yinsen straps Tony into the completed armored suit, telling him the way out of the cave. They set off a bomb inside the cell as a distraction for the guards as Tony powers up his suit. Yinsen realizes that they will not have enough time. He grabs a gun and runs off to distract the surviving guards.<br /><br />Tony, fully powered, muscles his way through the cave. The guards try to stop but his suit easily deflects their weapon fire. Half-way out, Stark finds Yinsen, mortally wounded. Yinsen reveals that this was his plan, sacrificing himself so Tony could escape, as Yinsen's family is already dead and he will now see them again. Tony tearfully thanks Yinsen for saving him. Yinsen's last words to Stark are not to waste his second chance.<br /><br />Tony turns his suit on the terrorists, igniting flame-throwers. He destroys their stockpile of weapons and uses a rudimentary jet-pack to blast away from the captive zone. Not long after firing, his jet-pack explodes and he crashes in the desert, but survives.<br /><br />Stark hikes through the desert until a couple of US helicopters fly overhead. A group of soldiers, led by Rhody, come across Tony. Rhody is overjoyed to find that his friend is alive.<br /><br />Tony returns to the United States after three months in captivity. Pepper wants Tony to receive medical treatment, but Tony states that there are only two things he wants: an American cheeseburger and a company press conference. Shortly after, Tony appears before a group of reporters and announces that he intends to shut down Stark Industries' weapons manufacturing division immediately. At the same time, Pepper is approached by Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) of the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement & Logistic Division agency. They want to talk to Tony Stark about his capture. Pepper schedules an appointment for them.<br /><br />That evening, Obadiah confronts Tony about his actions, furious. Obadiah knows that the stock value for their company (and, by extension, their financial status) is going to take a serious drop because of this announcement. Tony wants Stark Industries to move forward with arc reactor technology, but Obadiah thinks that the arc reactor is nothing but a publicity stunt. Through the conversation, Tony ends up revealing his prosthetic power-heart to Obadiah. Stane convinces Tony to lay low for a while so the company can sort things out.<br /><br />Pepper watches a news report on the declining value of Stark Industries when Tony asks for her help. He's created an upgraded mini arc reactor, but can't install it into his chest without someone to help. Pepper accidentally yanks out the cords for the old reactor too soon, putting Tony on the verge of cardiac arrest. They manage to complete the process in time. Tony tells Pepper to get rid of the old model since he's not a sentimental person.<br /><br />Tony comes to visit Rhodes and asks for help with a new private project. Rhody does not agree with Tony's approach; he thinks Stark is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of his capture and needs time to recover.<br /><br />Tony turns to his other best friend - JARVIS, the A.I. program - for help. Tony's plan is revealed to be an upgrade to his armored suit (referred to as ""Mark 2,"" with the suit from the terrorist cave being Mark 1).<br /><br />Meanwhile, the terrorists who held Tony captive are searching the desert, gathering all fragments of the original armored suit.<br /><br />Tony decides that the first thing he has to do is to perfect the armor's flight system. Since the leg-mounted jets prove too unstable, he creates arm-mounted stabilizers to balance out the system. Pepper comes in when he is testing the stabilizers and they find that it also creates a powerful repulsion beam that could also be used as a weapon. Pepper leaves a box on Tony's desk.<br /><br />Obadiah visits Tony and reveals that the board of directors have filed an injunction to gain control of Stark Industries. Tony isn't worried; he still maintains controlling interest in Stark Industries.<br /><br />Tony finally manages to perfect his flight system, and is delighted at the prospect of flying.<br /><br />A new armored suit is soon finished, looking like a heavily-streamlined version of Tony's Mark 1 armor. Tony connects with Jarvis to monitor the progress in the suit. Tony decides to take it out for a test flight, and he is thrilled by everything the suit can do. Tony decides to push the limit for higher-atmosphere flying, but at such great heights the suit becomes coated with ice and his power supply shuts down. Tony is barely able to reactivate his thrusters in time to avoid crashing into the ground. Stark returns home, but the armor is so heavy that it crashes through three floors of the house.<br /><br />As Tony recovers from his crash landing, he opens the box that Pepper left behind earlier. It's his original mini arc reactor, encased as a trophy with the message, ""Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart.""<br /><br />Tony analyzes more data and decides to rebuild the suit using gold titanium from an old project to solve the icing problem. Tony also instructs Jarvis to add some ""hot-rod red"" paint to the next suit, codenamed Mark 3. Tony then leaves to attend his annual benefit dinner while the new suit is being assembled and painted.<br /><br />At the charity event, Tony meets with Agent Coulson, who still wants to learn about Tony's incident. Tony then leaves to dance with Pepper and they share a moment together in the moonlight.<br /><br />Tony is then confronted by Christine, the reporter from an earlier scene. She shows him photographs of his weapons being used by a terrorist group the previous day in the Middle East. Tony confronts Obadiah on the matter, and Obadiah reveals that he is the one who filed the injunction against Tony. Obadiah calls himself an ""Iron Monger,"" and has no qualms about selling Stark Industries weapons to both sides of the conflict. Tony returns home, furious.<br /><br />While he is at home, listening to news reports of the worsening situation in the Middle East, he tests modifications to his hand jets, turning them into a weapon. When the new suit is completed, Stark steps in and essentially transforms into Iron Man for the first time, determined to right his company's wrongs.<br /><br />In a Middle East village, terrorists are rounding up civilians for capture & execution when they are confronted by a mysterious figure in red and gold. Iron Man has arrived. Within seconds, he defeats the first group of terrorists, using his advanced weapons to take out several without any innocent casualties. He leaves the group's leader alive and defenseless for the villagers to take their revenge on.<br /><br />While flying to find his weapons, Iron Man is shot down by a tank shell. Getting up, a second shell barely misses him. He responds by shooting a mini-missile at the tank, destroying it. He succeeds in destroying his missiles and taking out most of the terrorists.<br /><br />During the fight, CENTCOM detects the unknown agent. Col. Rhodes is asked about the status of any new developments. He contacts Tony, who claims that he knows nothing about what is happening. In the meantime, Iron Man is confronted by two F-22's. He tries to outrun the jets but they are too much for him. Tony calls Rhodes and reveals that he is responsible for the ""unidentified craft."" Rhody is furious about Tony sending in unauthorized equipment, and horrified when Tony explains that the ""equipment"" is actually himself! Iron Man is hit by one fighter jet, sending him flying into the wing of the second jet. The pilot is forced to eject, but the parachute fails to open. Iron Man, still under fire, manages to fly in and successfully deploy the parachute in time to save the pilot's life. Tony convinces Rhody to pass off what happened with the jets as a ""training exercise.""<br /><br />As Tony arrives back at home, Pepper catches him removing the battle-damaged Iron Man armor.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Ten Rings terrorist group is visited by none other than Obadiah. It is revealed that Stane paid the Ten Rings members to kill Stark, but they realized who Stark was and demanded a much higher price. Obadiah takes the remnants of the Mark 1 armor they have gathered.<br /><br />Tony tries to talk Pepper into helping him, believing that nothing else matters but stopping the people who he put in harm's way. Pepper is moved by Tony's dedication, and agrees. She goes into Obadiah's office with a tiny piece of equipment designed to copy files from the computer. As Pepper sifts through stored files, she finds a video from the terrorists proving that Obadiah was responsible for Tony's capture.<br /><br />Obadiah comes into the office just as she is leaving, but Pepper manages to get away. However, as soon as he powers up the computer, Obadiah realizes what she was up to. On the way out, Pepper is joined by Agent Coulson and he agrees to help stop Obadiah with his fellow agents.<br /><br />Obadiah meets with his team of developers working on his own armored suit. They have rebuilt the components, but they cannot re-create Stark's arc reactor. Stane is furious; then realizes that he has one other option.<br /><br />Stane arrives at Tony's house and paralyzes him with a sonic weapon. Obadiah yanks out the power source from Tony's heart, taunting him all the while. After he leaves, Tony realizes that he has only one hope for survival - the preserved arc reactor that Pepper gave him in a display case. He gets the power source installed just as Rhody arrives.<br /><br />Pepper, Coulson and several other agents arrive at Obadiah's research facility. They spot the Mark 1 Armor and a storage location where something else was kept. Just then, a gigantic robotic suit comes to life and attacks them - it's Obadiah's counterpart suit, code-named the Iron Monger.<br /><br />Rhody watches Tony suit up, awestruck at the Iron Man costume. As Tony flies away, Rhody spots a new, silver-colored prototype suit... then shakes his head and mumbles ""Next time.""<br /><br />Iron Man arrives and begins to fight Iron Monger. Jarvis warns Tony that he has only about half power in the suit; the older power source wasn't designed to work alongside the newer suit. The two ironclad warriors have a huge battle. Tony grabs the Iron Monger and climbs higher. Iron Monger struggles but before long begins to freeze up - his suit still has the same icing problem that Tony's other suit had. Iron Monger manages to escape from this, and Iron Man is now almost completely powerless.<br /><br />Tony instructs Pepper to overload the building's arc reactor, which will generate a shockwave strong enough to knock out the Iron Monger's suit. Pepper is hesitant, believing that Tony could also be killed. Tony manages to keep fighting while she builds up power to the reactor. The reactor releases its shockwave, knocking out the Iron Monger, which falls into the reactor, killing Stane and destroying the reactor. Stark's original mini arc reactor sparks back to life, allowing Tony to survive.<br /><br />Days later, Rhody holds a press conference about the incident with the two robots. Tony is impressed with the newspapers coming up with the name ""Iron Man,"" and plans to adopt it. Agent Coulson has released cover stories about Obadiah and the ""truth"" about Iron Man (who will be referred to as Stark's bodyguard). Pepper thanks Coulson but cannot remember the full name of the group he belongs to. Coulson just tells them to call it S.H.I.E.L.D. and states that they will be in touch again.<br /><br />Tony goes before the reporters once more, and prepares to comply with the cover story. But, before he can even start, Tony Stark throws away his notes and declares ""I am Iron Man."" The press goes into a frenzy.<br /><br />Much later (after the credits), Tony returns home to find a mysterious man in black telling him that as Iron Man, Tony has become part of a larger universe. Tony asks who the man is. He turns around and introduces himself- Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson). He's come to talk with Tony Stark about an upcoming project- known only as ""The Avenger Initiative."""
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	To be honest this was one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. It was a true letdown because I've been a fan of Indy since I can remember. Raiders was fantastic, Temple was so-so, and Last Crusade was perfect. But this, this was pretty sucky. One thing I just couldn't get over was the aliens. Aliens shouldn't be in Indiana Jones. I think George Lucas got his franchises mixed up. Second is Indy having a son. Don't get me wrong I thought Shia Lebeouf was great, but his character was unnecessary. Now I did like Indy taking on Commies, that was one of the few good things about it. Harrison Ford really let me down.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	It was announced weeks ago that Harry Potter & The Order Of The Phoenix is being released on DVD on December 11, 2007.  Why isn't this available for pre-order yet?  While I enjoyed the film and what was shown, if you've read the book you know how much they left out.  My only hope is that some of the deleted scenes will cover stuff that was edited out of the movie.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This is a must-see documentary. Every person in America who eats needs to watch this, pay close attention and act accordingly.
B002QZ1RS6	3.0	b	These videos are amazing they really do work you out and they are serious about you having to be dedicated. Its tough!!! The only think I dont understand is why they made these videos where you cant play them in a DVD player. I have tryed on several DVD players and it has something to do with the playback. The first few that I have tried worked on my PS3 I am hoping the rest will as well. I know they work on a computer. But why would they want you to work out from a computer. Other than that the workouts are great if they would fix that it would make these videos that much better.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I watched well after the main theatrical release and with the benefit of recommendations from friends.  I was very entertained. Well worth the rental.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This definitely changed the way I view eating. I am thankful this movie came out and I plan to pass it onto all my friends.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	Our copy of this DVD has been played more times than I can count since my kids got it for Christmas 2006. It's a fairly long movie with a lot of action, which is perfect for car trips to Grandma's house 100 miles away.<br /><br />At first, I wasn't crazy about the voice of Lightning McQueen or even of Doc Hudson, but they've grown on me. And with Larry the Cable Guy as the voice of Mater, there are some screamingly funny parts to the movie. I didn't think the plot was that predictable, as others have written. The end was not what I expected, which was good.<br /><br />If you watch this on a large enough screen, you'll find that even the insects are cars. They leave tiny little tire tracks on the windows when they crawl on them. Oh, and watch for the tire tracks that some of the airplanes leave in the desert sky...
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This movie is perfect and well-developed. I like this movie. It is because this movie is very exciting, just like the previous Harry Potter movie. Compare with all the Harry Potter movie, it is very good but the ending is sad. The shooting style is great. For the acting, they are great. For the visuals, it is all good especially the final fighting scene. Overall, a perfect movie with no doubts.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I love all the Harry Potter films!  This is the first part of the last book and it is awesome.  The movie follows the book fairly well but has a few added scenes...I think this additional time should have been used with more book details though.  I still have to say I love the movie and enjoy watching the characters from the book come alive!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I debated back & forth on whether or not to buy this show because I do not have cable so I've never seen it before & because of the price... I thought that $36 was expensive for only 12 episodes, but I sure am glad that I decided to buy it!!! This show is great, very entertaining... wasn't what I expected at all! Still wish there were more episodes though. It has action, romance, murder, mystery, cool & interesting characters, but it is definitely not for kids. Lots of cursing & nudity involved, but that is one of the reasons why I like it! lol It's different. I just finished watching seasons 1-2 & am fixing to order season 3, I am completely hooked!! I hope this show sticks around for a long time.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	well they said it was ok but it like brand new not one scrach on it and it came very fast way before the estimated shipping date and it was very cheap very happy
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Okay - I cannot wait for the second (and more to come I hope) installment of Ironman.  Loved it!!!  Very action packed and entertaining on all levels...funny, fast-paced, romantic...everything you could ask for.  I really recommend this flick!!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	In a nutshell it is one of the best workouts I have ever had.  I spent a great deal of time researching it on the net before I bought it.  If you need a push towards buying this product then I hope this helps, DO IT!  I'm technically obese and I know my limits.  I did as much of the workout as I could and used the diet program without cheating.  In the first 2 weeks I lost almost 3 inches off my waist.  It works according to your level of commitment.<br />Good Luck!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is the most funny DVD I have watched in a long time.  I arrived very quickly and I am happy about that.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	Poorly written. Not worth your time. Also Flow of the movie was very choppy. The actors? Honestly I feel had nothing to work with.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"Just as Iron Man is the king of Marvel's second-tier comic heroes, Jon Favreu's ""Iron Man"" rules over the second-tier Marvel film adaptations.  Though not on par with the finest Marvel adaptations, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" series and Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" films, ""Iron Man"" rules over all others with an iron fist.  It all rests on the shoulders of Robert Downey Jr., who portrays titular hero Tony Stark with all the reckless ego which so many now associate with Americans.  Stark is a true American hero: he wasn't born with any superpowers, and though he was born into a substantially-wealthy family, it is he who pushes his corporation to its limits and who ultimately goes beyond those limits to become one of the shiniest superheroes.  He's further separated from his peers by the fact that he doesn't live his life in painful rememberance, and thus it's not pain that motivates him to do good.  What does motivate him, probably not even he knows.<br /><br />Like its protagonist, ""Iron Man"" is not one of the deepest superhero films to hit the screen.  Unlike ""Batman Begins"" (the sequel to which, July's ""The Dark Knight,"" stands as ""Iron Man""'s fiercest competition), ""Iron Man"" does not delve deep into the psychosis of its hero, opting instead to focus on his struggles as an up-and-coming superhero.  Stark's origins are explored in a gritty fashion not unlike ""Batman Begins.""  The similarities between Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne further connect the two films, but Favreau's vivid, colorful style ensures that the similarities end there.  Favreau was an interesting choice to direct, given that his past filmography is highlighted by two family films, ""Elf"" and ""Zathura,"" but he doesn't disappoint.  Stark's non-iron-clad activities mimic the character's lavish lifestyle, while the action sequences may be the sturdiest in any Marvel film.<br /><br />But far more sturdy is Robert Downey Jr.  Like Favreau, Downey was an unlikely choice for the film, but Downey elevates the film to a level it could never have reached led by another actor.  In fact, this is the best thing Downey has ever done.  His dedication to the role and love of the character shines through every one of Stark's smarmy remarks, apparent in every arrogant move he makes.  Downey turns a character who could easily lose the audience's sympathy into a guy one can't help but love.  It's hard not to get excited about Downey's cameo in ""The Incredible Hulk,"" Marvel's next movie, released in mid-June.<br /><br />Though Downey could easily hold the film on his own, he's supported by a delightful cast.  Most delightful is Gwyneth Paltrow, who is as adorable and charming in the role of Stark's gentle secretary Pepper Potts as anyone.  One wishes a character so irresistible and clever as Potts would play a bigger role in the film, but no doubt that'll happen in the sequel.  Similarly likeable is Terrence Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, military pilot Jim Rhodes - and who, as any fan of the comic knows, will wind up as Stark's iron-clad sidekick, War Machine.<br /><br />The most surprising performance comes from Jeff Bridges.  Bridges, perhaps best known as ""The Dude"" from the Coen brothers' ""The Big Lebowski,"" isn't usually the bad guy.  But that's just what he is in this film, and what a villain he is!  As Stark's partner-turned-archenemy Obadiah Stone, Bridges exhudes a ruthlessness and complete lack of morality not seen in any other cinematic supervillain.  His performance is what Kevin Spacey should have aspired to when he portrayed Lex Luthor in ""Superman Returns.""  It's a welcome change from the over-the-top behavior most supervillains are so fond of.<br /><br />Superhero films tend to be fond of heavy effects; after all, most of the films require them.  But the effect of the effects tends to be lessened by underdeveloped or overused computer-generated imagery (case in point: the last superhero picture, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"").  Not in ""Iron Man.""  There's the inevitable amount of C.G.I. effects, but the effects have been precisely designed.  They may even surpass the stunning effects from last summer's ""Transformers.""<br /><br />All this would mean little if the movie was not based upon a decent script.  This script is a fine one indeed, the product of two writing duos (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway).  It never takes itself too seriously, but just seriously enough, choosing well-timed witticism over self-conscious grandeur (as in ""Daredevil"" or the last ""X-Men"" movie).  It also, miraculously, is able to appeal equally to those familiar and those unfamiliar with the comics.  Part of this is the sensible decision to upgrade Tony Stark from a Vietnam-era weapons designer to a military designer for the Iraq War.  But while it appeals to fans and non-fans, it's those familiar with the comic that will enjoy the film the most: it hints at a number of potential storylines for sequels, and even sets up an Avengers movie.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is one of the increasingly rare films which longs for a sequel and which we wish would receive one.  Now that the film has grossed a stunning amount of money at the box office, a release date for ""Iron Man 2"" has been set for April 30, 2010, and a second sequel is ready as soon as that one's finished.  Bring it on.  ""Iron Man"" may not be an excellent film like ""Spider-Man 2,"" ""Batman Begins,"" or even the original ""Superman,"" but it's a darn good superhero film.  And if not as sturdy as steel, it is certainly as shiny as iron."
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	the movie was good and had quite a bit of action. I love Charlize Theron and she plays a great part in this.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	this movie is wonderful! the main 3 actors shown lots of growth, and it shows; more in depth acting, the last 2 movies are very dark, and more adult like, but worth every penny & every moment to watch! Highly reccommend to any one!  sad to see these come to an end
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	If you are wondering if it is a good buy for this Blu-ray format disc, buy!<br />A really good buy, beautiful colors, superb pictures and sound quality. Not bad story line.
B002QZ1RS6	3.0	b	"The workouts themselves are great.  Anyone who complains about them being too tough just has to modify and slowly build up to doing what the on-screen crew is doing.<br /><br />The problem that I have has to do with the quality of the dvd's.  I ordered two sets -- one to give as a gift.  In both sets the routines ""Max interval sports training & Insane abs,"" and ""Insane abs,"" jump from one part of the routine to another every ten seconds or so.  The on-screen timer jumps around with the sceen-changes, but the dvd timer clicks along in the normal fashion, so the dvd's were 'printed' this way.  In one of the sets I received, all of the dvd's that are supposed to contain two routines do not have the second one.<br /><br />Beachbody publishes this and does not seem be a quality company.  When I contacted them about the problem, they were uninterested because I had purchased from secondary sources.  If you want to purchase this workout, do so knowing that you may be getting only part of what you are paying for."
B00447G29S	2.0	b	"Just in time for Christmas, I have another opportunity to upset some people with my two-cents on ""The Polar Express."" I came into the film with no preconceptions--if anything, I thought it would be cute and pleasant. I am not one of those people who treasures the book and dislikes the film for not being true enough. While I may not be the most sensitive viewer in the world, I've been known to enjoy a good Christmas tale or two. The animated Grinch, Frosty and Rudolph all work for me. ""A Christmas Story,"" ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and a number of variations of ""A Christmas Carol"" always delight. And I love animated features from classic Disney to current day Pixar (only the good ones, of course). But, truth be told, ""The Polar Express"" kind of mystified me.<br /><br />The film has some visually appealing moments, and the animation is state of the art. The action sequences were technically impressive. I particularly enjoyed the scenes with no characters (for reasons I'll outline in a bit). The exterior shots of the train are stunning, especially during the more exciting moments. When the Express is racing around roller coaster tracks or sliding across ice, the movie comes to life. And an extended sequence following a ticket as it flies through the air is artfully done--a truly great moment. The voice acting is fine. While I didn't particularly think it stood out, it also didn't hamper the story. And the plot was serviceable, if not unique in any way.<br /><br />Much has been made about using the real actor's movements and turning them into animation. I certainly don't have a problem with the concept--but in some cases, it had an unfortunate effect. I truly found some of the characters to be creepy. Now, I usually try to use objective wording--but ""creepy"" is exactly how my friend and I both described it after the movie. And interestingly enough, it is a word used many, many times within other amazon reviews. The little girl, especially, was so unreal in her realness--I don't know, something was lost in the translation.<br /><br />Then there were a couple of exceedingly odd musical numbers. One, the songs were bizarre. And two, the frantic pacing of the accompanying ""dance"" performances (be it by waiters or elves) was jarring and unsettling. The music adds nothing to the story except another opportunity to be ""creeped out."" I didn't feel it was necessary to try to extend this story, the film is too long by half. Only the most attentive and patient of adults or children are likely to make it to the end without needing a break. While, of course, the film's message is sweet--it's laid on so thickly at the end. I know some people love this film, but for me it didn't work. Call me Scrooge this year, but ""The Polar Express"" will not be joining my annual Christmas viewing. KGHarris, 12/06."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	It doesn't define ID or Evolution, links evolution to Nazis and eugenics for emotional manipulation, does not discuss specific conditions under which professors were terminated.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	The new Indy film seems to continue all the elements that made the first three Indy films so enjoyable. In many respects, it recaptures the fun and magic of the very first Indy movie. There was even a brief glimpse of the Ark of the Covenent during the brawling fight in the Warehouse at Area 51. I hope they do, as rumored, go ahead and make yet another film in the series. Maybe next time they can use actual aliens as the bad guys. Indiana Jones Vs. Gort?
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I LOVE Walter!!! And the Dead Terrorist is too funny for words.  This is a must see!
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	TRUST THE REVIEWS ITS REALLY SUCKS!!!! i only give it two stars, bcuz Charlize Theron did such a great job. i kept hoping that it would eventually pick up and i'd stop falling asleep, but no such luck. i even went back just in case i missed something while i was sleeping, but i missed NOTHING. uuuuurgh i'm truly disappointed, becuz i was excited about the cast and concept for the movie. Next time i'm going to Mickey Ds Dollar Menu with my 3.99 :(!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I had never watched it before, and also the daycare children i watch enjoyed it also.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I purchased the DVD Jeff Dunham Arguing with myself, along with two others. They were hysterical. I would definately buy them again. I would highly recommend any product associated with Jeff Dunham.
B000S5KGH4	1.0	b	The funniest part of this act is the one star reviews on Amazon. One star for the act., four stars for the comments.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	My favorite movie of all-time.  This is a great irish mafia, gangster movie.  Te director and cast are all A-Listers and the movie has a lot of action and twists.  A must for any dvd collection.  Best movie of 2006, by far!
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	"This review is for the 2 disc special edition.  DON'T BOTHER!  I almost went back to the store to demand my money back.  The extras are completely worthless.  I usually love deleted scenes, but they are literally scraps here and, except for one amusing (uncompleted) scene with Emma Thompson, hardly worth watching, even once.  The ""Tonks"" tour is not informative or entertaining, and the ""Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter"" special is the one they played on A&E - entertaining, but not worth the extra $8 I paid for this version.<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews on the movie itself - I enjoyed it, but it's not my favorite (that would still be the 3rd one - Prisoner of Azkaban).  At times it seemed like I was watching a movie trailer or a recap.  But I enjoy especially how the tone of the movies are maturing and darkening with the characters and storyline.<br /><br />So - I would buy the movie again in a second - just not the ""Special Edition."""
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	I enjoyed the presentation of this move and the twist on the interpretation of the story.  It was well planned and held my attention.  I recommend this movie for  viewing by teens and above.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Most comedians will have have you laughing here and there...but he will have you laughing the whole time!!!!!
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Best movie e<br />ver! It had so much action and a little romance. I absolutely love this movie. I love CHRIS HEMSWORTH!!! :)
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"This is a movie that is not afraid to tell the truth. Meat and dairy farmers want to paint a picture of "" happy cows and chickens.""<br />Nothing could be further from the truth. It reinforces  the reasons to be a vegetarian or at least to know about the food industry.."
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	"Did you guys know there was an invention a few years ago called color television?  So what if it is a comic strip? Did you know its cheaper to make a movie in black and white? Quentin Tarantino is laughing all the way to the bank on this one, and don't give me the ""he was experimenting, trying to make a comic book, made a revolutionary new idea"" statement. The old 70's spider man series did this concept ages ago.<br /><br />Anyway. Some of the mini stories are interesting, some where silly or boring. I am not a big KillBill fan either. I like Quentin Tarantino when he does stuff like ""from dusk till dawn""<br /><br />Sin city might be worth watching once, but I would not see it again. Loved the violence though :)"
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"http://www.amazon.com/Departed-Single-Disc-Widescreen-Leonardo-DiCaprio/dp/B000M341QE/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&ie=UTF8&qid=1326659847&sr=1-1<br /><br />While the seller feedback option isn't available yet, I've already received the item from goHastings. They are prompt, deliver quality goods in a very short amount of time and I'm always happy with the product, whether it's a book, a cd or a dvd - this can be said of the numerous sellers I've dealt with, although I have ordered from goHastings quite a few times in the past year. The movie ""The Departed"" is a thriller/suspense/drama/action feature film with a superior cast and directed by Martin Scorcese, no less - talk about a seriously intense and engaging movie! Non-stop thrills, tension, constant action and interactions with the various characters, intriguing plots and sub-plots; just an all-around wonderful movie worth watching many times over. Everyone in the movie did a superb job and the movie was very enjoyable. Highly recommended!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Another Pixar success story.  This film will suit a young girl or boy.  Even though it's about cars, there are girl cars and boy cars in the movie.  My son, who is 22 months, enjoys this film as he enjoys matchboxes and real cars on the road.  Highly recommended.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	When i had watched Jeff Dunham-Arguing With Myself, I laughed so hard.<br />This video will relax you and get your mind off a hard day and will turn a night into laughter.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	If everyone in America would be brave enough to watch this film, it would help to move us all in a healthier direction!
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	Hmmm, where to start... I stopped watching this movie after 15 minutes. [spoilers] Whty would a company invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to build a ship to fly to another star system just to land at the first place they can find? Why not sending robots into the newly discovered location? Why putting people into the team that will definitely cause trouble... It's all an illogical mess.<br /><br />The good thing: The visuals are stunning :)<br /><br />Don't waste your money!
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	The angle of the movie was interesting, the special effects are very impressive and Charlize Theron is majestic, she proves once again that she is not just a pretty face, she knows how to think and act, unlike Kristen Stewart who should really rethink her career as an actress. And it's me being nice.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	I bought this for my kids for Christmas.I enjoyed this movie on DVD. I saw it over the summer on the Cape and it was just as good as I remembered.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	good i dont know what else to say about it was a fine product thats about all i have to say
B0006989TE	1.0	b	I saw this film in the cinema and disappointment doesn`t come close! It was like blowing a balloon of suspense up for almost two hours to find it bursts at the last moment.<br /><br />Watch in awe...... as what promises to be a firecracker turns into a damp squib!<br /><br />Sit back in suspense......for 15 minutes!<br /><br />Let your arms grip the armrests.....as they go numb!<br /><br />Feel the tension......as you feel yourself ripped off!<br /><br />But above all, more than anything that has gone before..... feel the relief...........when the end credits roll!!<br /><br />Now buy the DVD it makes a neat frisbee or drinks coaster!!!
B000H7I6CU	3.0	b	As is usual with a Pixar film, Cars has excellent visuals, and they really shine in the Blu-Ray version of the film.  The movie is sure to be a hit with the kids, but falls short in one area that other Pixar films have excelled -- appeal to adults.  I viewed this one once, and will probably leave it on the shelf for the sake of completeness, but I can't see watching it again, like I have with Monsters, Inc., or the exceptional WALL-E.  If you're looking for something to entertain the kids, save some money and get it on DVD instead of Blu-Ray.  If you're looking to build a complete collection of Pixar on Blu-Ray, it's worth the money.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	We bought this movie for our 2 year-old son who chooses to play with cars over anything else. He loved the movie. He watches it over and over again. After seeing the movie, we have bought him many of the cars from the movie and other items like bedding, etc. because now,  he is obsessed with the movie. My daughter likes it, too. They sit in my son's room and watch it every night before bedtime. Highly reccommended.
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	Cool effects do not a cool movie make!  A very thinly threaded plot of cobbled together scenes that might have developed into something engaging if not treated so superficially.  The 'fairy forest and the great white stag'?  How about an inkling of how this helps Snow White understand her destiny and her choices?  Awakened by True Love's first kiss?  There is no emotional connection evident between SW and the Huntsman or SW and William or anyone else that would make you think she'd ever be revived.  Really, really glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Received the item promptly.  Movie is one to see again - at least yearly - to review marital values.  Purchased it for my newly married son and wife.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I love this guy!!! Unlike those single and swinging flaunty pea cocks for 'entertainment' this one can relate to 'life' in general. He is just the medicine I need a few times a year!<br /><br />-A. Danner<br />Proud Amazon addict!
B00447G29S	1.0	b	This is not a review of the seller, the product was shipped as promised and on time by the shipper.<br /><br />I never watched the film, so keep in mind I'm not reviewing how good the film is, but the 3D DVD itself.  I purchased this because I have a Samsung 3D TV (7000).  I just assumed this would work on my TV, but it doesn't.  I tried the paper glasses to see if they work, and they do to some degree.  However, I have no idea how you could sit through the entire film with those paper glasses.  Regardless, the 3D didn't work on my 3D TV, so I'll just keep it and watch it in 2D instead.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	For the most part it was done well.  As with most movies these days, it has a lot of leftist twist and injections that take away from the historical values that otherwise would be important.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	I have really enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's other movies, especially 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs'. Each of his movies has a gimmick or payoff, so to speak. It is getting harder and harder to top them, and he must be running low on new ones.<p>You definitely have to suspend your disbelief in this one. This late nineteenth century Pennsylvania village is sitting in the middle of a not too large pasture, and is surrounded by woods on all four sides. There are 'creatures' living in the woods, the villagers stay out of the woods, and the 'creatures' stay out of the village. That is the 'truce'.<p>How did the villagers get to there location if these maurading creatures are all around them, and hey, where does all their stuff keep coming from. The land the village occupies is no larger than a cow pasture and cannot be self-sustaining.<p>But nevermind about all that. The acting is pretty good, especially Joaquim Phoenix. The worst is Adrien Brody, as an over the top halfwit. Director Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard is really good as the blind Ivy. <p>I suspended my disbelief, and looked forward to the payoff. It is, in my honest opinion, very disappointing. Shyamalan really needs to stop using this 'payoff' or 'gimmick' formula because audiences keep expecting it now and will only be disappointed. It's time for something new. <p>M. Night Shyamalan is a good storyteller and film maker, and some of his previous movies were brilliant. But it is time to stop with the gimmick payoffs because he just can't keep topping himself anymore. I look forward to Mr. Shyamalan's next film, and hope it is something non-gimmicky.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	Good Blu-Ray picture. Movie on the other hand is no where near as good as Fargo. The ending ruined it for me.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"Insanity definitely works and will get you in shape.  You should be prepared to make a commitment to do the DVD daily.  The workouts are hard and you will sweat a lot every time.  I found I had to make a few small adjustments to a few of the exercises because I simply could not do them (mostly the plank work) so I do "" girl"" style pushups instead of the regular, etc.... However, once I made these few substitutions, I was on my way to a better body.  I do recommend this workout and probably will add more beach body workouts to my collection in the future.  Shawn T. Is motivating and helps u do the exercises correctly.  This is no walk in the park.... It is real cardio and u will be sore.  Enjoy."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Ben Stein is a genius. In this documentary Stein exposes how close minded the scientific community can be. If you search for reviews of this movie via Google you will find a plethora of negative reviews, the majority from scientific sources. They attack this movie because it shows that they adhere to a religion or a philosophy, not the facts as good science should. I hate to break it to you scientists but facts are what good science is built on, not your preconceived dogma. Intelligent design IS at least as strong a theory as evolution and in this film, Stein proves it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has not already decided that despite the facts they are sticking with the theory of evolution.
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	This movie is the most disguisting pile of manure I've ever  been sujected to.I gave it two stars only because Amazon policy mandates that every product reviewed receive at least 1 star,the second star is for,the all to brief appearence of,the beautiful and exciting Rosario Dawson.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"Iron Man is a Marvel Comic movie that doesn't disapoint. It's better than Spiderman 3 ""which even Fantastic Four 2 was even more fun than"" with more wit and a lot less whining, crying and.... disco dancing. Hell it's the best Marvel movie since Spiderman, Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2. It slowly picks up which is why it gets compared to the Hulk by some people. However it's always entertaining and more fun than the Hulk.<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr's Stark slowly becomes Iron Man but the movie is never boring since Downey carries the film well with his quick wit. It has pleanty of laughs while Downey himself is very funny while totally owning the character of Stark. He also has chemestry with Gwyneth Paltrow who has a quick wit of her own here as a trustworthy employee of his. Terrance Howard is in good form as well as Stark's military friend. I also liked a bald Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner. When there is action it's super cool and well done. But the movie wouldn't have been as good if Robert Downey Jr. wasn't casted. He's not just funny here but he shows that he can handle playing the heroic type and he does it well."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Ignorance really is bliss.  I was aware, to an extent of how inhumane animals were treated.  I was aware of Monsantos evil ways.  But this movie still packed enough of a punch and forced me to open my eyes a little more.  Actually seeing the conditions of the animals THAT WE EAT, before they are slaughtered was just sad.  The people that work for these companies treat their employees the same way.  These are people that probably have no morals of any sort, nor do they value the human life.  It's disgusting.  After years of evolution and working hard to create rights and laws, people are still working in deplorable conditions.  Seriously, is any of this necessary, except for big monopolies to pad their pockets?<br /><br />Of course it's pro-organic, but do you really want to eat a chicken that is living in so much filth that it's fed antibiotics its entire life?  Do you want a chicken that is loaded with growth hormones?  How about a cow that's stuck in a pen on top of thousands of other cows, eating a diet of genetically modified corn and then killed inhumanely?  We should all be forced to think about what we eat and try and take action against what's really going on.  I think this country needs an overhaul of the system.  I think it needs to just blow up (come to a head), so we can go back to simpler times.<br /><br />I'm glad this movie focused on the subject at hand, without using gore and blood.  If you want to see that, go watch an action flick.  And for those that say it's biased and one sided.  Of course it is.  Just like any other controversial subject.  Take what you want from it and discard the rest.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This movie is so funny! Never eat while you are watching it, because you'll laugh so hard and choke! I think everybody needs to see this!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I really like the True Blood series. The whole story line is very good and the new twist on the vampire story is believable.  Season 2 is off to a great start. The Blu-Ray version has flawless video and audio. Enjoy!
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	A harsh winter is followed by the invasion of a dark and mysterious army that lures the King into battle to protect his kingdom. The dark soldiers shatter like glass in battle and they were defeated by the King and his army. Ravenna (Charlize Theron) was a prisoner in a wagon held in the dark army camp and the King saw her beauty and married her. Ravenna is a witch and she kills the king to steal his kingdom. She unlocks the kingdom's gates to let her brother and his army into the city. The entire town is at war and Snow White is trapped in the city and the Queen imprisons Snow White (Kristen Stewart) in a tower.<br /><br />The Queen has two men hang a huge polished dish on the wall. It is a living metal mirror with magical powers. The mirror flows onto the floor and becomes a cloaked man of metal. He tells her she is the fairest of them all. The Queen absorbs the life force from other women to stay young and she wants to live forever. The Queen then has all of the people in the city slain except for Snow White.....<br /><br />I love movies of all types and I rarely rate them poorly but this movie was just lacking on many levels. It possibly has one of the worst scripts for a major motion picture I have ever seen. I looked it up and the movie cost over $170 million to make and you would think they would have spent more on the script. Kristen Stewart didn't say 10 words until the middle of the movie and then I wish she had kept her mouth shut. She acted stiffly and bored and like she was reading from cue cards off the set. The only saving grace for this movie was the beautiful Charlize Theron and even she could not save this film. While at times she performed her role perfectly there were other times that her character was just over the top of expected reality. I can only attribute that to poor directing.<br /><br />I cannot recommend it to you as a good movie. If you like Charlize Theron then you should see it but otherwise it is not a real entertaining film. The length of the film is about 2 hours and 11 minutes and it should have been cut by 30 minutes.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Purchased 2 set DVD from Jeff Dunham for my husband.  I believe he is obsessed with these dvd's.  We can't watch anything else.  He has just about memorized all the skits.<br /><br />Love it.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This is one of those Blu-Ray movies you should have in your collection.  The movie looks like it did when i saw it in theaters.  The BD Live features are kind of cool, especially if it's your first BD Live title, but it shouldn't be the primary reason to buy this movie.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I didn't know if I was going to like it cause of all the bad reviews but it turned out okay.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"This is a television miniseries at its best.  Paul Giamatti is a superb actor at any time, but he exceeds his best in his performance in ""John Adams"" playing the lead role.  This miniseries takes you from Adams introduction into the beginning of the revolutionary period of American history, his role in the Continental Congress up to his death.  Laura Linney, has the role of Abigail Adams, his wife, his best friend, and most trusted advisor.<br />Anyone with a love for American history will agree that this DVD is one that you must have in your collection."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	Entertaining and suspenseful from beginning to end.  I would recommend it.  It is not for the faint of heart.  But if you want entertainment it's great.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is a great movie, very motivating.  Great third film from these<br />brothers, who also brought us Flywheel and Facing the Giants.  GREAT!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Great film for whole family.  Robert Downing, Jr is Iron Man.  So glad he was chosen for this part.  Very little sexual innuendo, ""bad"" language practically non-existent, lots of action.  Loved it."
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	Not the worst Indy film made and obviously not the best. In parts this was a very good film and in other parts terrible. It seems like it was made for kids in some scenes. The extras are good and well worth getting the 2 disc version. Average film, above average Blu-ray. Shows off the picture quality well in HD though, in some parts this is a beautiful movie.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	The acting was not that great and had an awful plot, but the special effects were engaging and entertaining. There are only so many ways you could skin a cat since we all know the story of Snow White.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	He is hysterical.  It is a great show if all you want to do is laugh.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I had problems with another company sending this dvd. They didnt send it at all and never responded to any of my e-mails. THIS situation was completely different. Very fast delivery and dvd was brand new.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	I loved reading McCullough's biography of John Adams. The movie on this DVD demonstrates that the HBO Producers and Director did not really read the book. They practiced eisogesis rather than exegesis. The redeeming feature of the movie was the excellent use of special effects to create 18th Century America.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	Let me start with the only good thing about this movie.......the special effects. And that's where it ends. I honestly hated this movie! I was so looking forward to getting it, found it in the mail today and had to sit down right then and watch it...... ummmmm,I feel like I just wasted time that could have been better spent, cleaning my house or something. Not only did I hate it, so did my daughters. Oh well, such is life....
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I saw the movie first, which is totally superb, and garnered several Oscars. In researching the movie,I found that it stemmed originally from a book by Cormac McCarthy. Sadly, I'd never heard of McCarthy. Reading his biography I discovered that he was the recipient of the MacArthur Genius Award and the Pulitzer and is considered by many to be one of today's greatest living writers. So I picked up the book. Wow! I know that several reviewers haven't been able to get into the wierd punctuation and other McCarthy idiosyncracies, but once you get used to it and perhaps read a bit out loud so that you can understand what he is trying to achieve through the rythym and pace of the uninterruped story, the author's incredibly powerful voice takes over. One of best books I've ever read. Some people have labled it a thriller, but I'm not sure if that is descriptive. Reading McCarthy (or watching the movie) there are many levels of pleasures that you feel from his masterful use of language and regional dialogue that take it so far above the conventional thriller structure that it is simply something else entirely. Some people here are only reviewing this as a conventional thriller, but that isn't what it is. All I know is that I will take the book and the movie from my shelf from time to time to savor a superb writer at the full height of his considerable skills.<br /><br />And the movie stands on its own.  Most adaptations don't deliver the goods in terms of the power of a masterful writer.  This one does.  And I don't think that any actor would have been as well cast as Tommy Lee Jones for the role of the sheriff.  He brings the local West Texas culture to life.<br /><br />So either way. Read the book and then see the movie.  Or see the movie and read the book.  They are both terrific.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	An historic miniseries very well made, accurate, either in locations or in costums, casting very well choosen, I enjoied that
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is the first of two parts of the last two films. The special effects are impressive and the acting is right on the mark. Especially well-played is the part played by Helena Bonham Carter as she plays the demented and crazy wizard Bellatrix Lestrange. As a fantasy movie it is splendid; as an adaptation of the book it is quite good. Clocking in at 140 minutes it feels a bit short and I wish they could release an extended version of the film. Still and all a quite good film that I can gladly recommend. 4/5.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	Used the product twice and from what I did, I had a good workout. The only reason I didnt keep using it is because I dont have the time to do cardio at home when Im already in the gym five times a week.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This movie is a stunning piece of work, if it doesn't win any kind of Academy Award for at least special effects, then there's something wrong with the world.<br /><br />The cast is perfect with the slight exception of Alba, who while does a good job of acting, doesn't live up to Nancy in all her black and white glory, if you get what I mean. She seems slightly out of place.<br /><br />Bruce Willis owns this movie, Hartigan is one character who you will feel for, especially with the emotionally gut wrenching scene at the end.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much of the story away, but whether you're a comic freak or a moviephile, go out and see this one opening day. For once, both sides won't be disappointed.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the darkest Potter film to date.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his fellow Hogwarts students continue to fight evil as well as hone their skills as wizards.  In his unrelenting attempt to avenge the death of his parents by the demonic Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) who appears in and out of the film, Harry never gives up his untiring efforts.  For the premise of this film, Hogwarts's leadership is under scrutiny that involves accusations against Harry and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and one of the new characters, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), the annoying and sinister teacher who is after the coveted title as headmaster.<br /><br />The film is extremely long.  But as with the other four Potter films, the cinematography and special effects are exceptional.  The pyrotechnics are loud and shattering, especially the concluding scenes where Dumbledore battles it out with Voldemort, which resonates duel-like scenes from very well known sci-fi film, such as Return of the Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.<br /><br />Thus far, the storyline is complex and intense as the characters battle good and evil.  And another interesting observation is how Harry and his friends continue to grow before our eyes. Yet again, Harry experiences one of his first pubescent encounters with his ongoing romance with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and the two share an unavoidable intimate kiss under the mistletoe, which he describes somewhat immaturely to Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) as very wet; we also see the ever so delicate and sensitive Neville (Matthew Lewis) slowly mature with confidence.<br /><br />Harry and the Order of the Phoenix has fantasy and adventure that many Potter fans have grown accustomed to.  As the characters and film content matures, this particular film may appeal to older children and adults.  Otherwise, the Potter films never ceases to amaze.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	I know that alot of people will disagree with me and that's fine. I will be honest and say that I did not make it through the entire first season. I just couldn't take any more. I have read all of Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse novels and they are fantastic. Now people say that I will compare it to the books and that's not true. I just don't think it's any good. My first complaint is that Sookie and the vampires (Bill and Eric) aren't good looking enough. Sorry if you don't agree. That's also true of the Twilight movies, too. Secondly, the writing is so bad! OMG! There is not one likeable character on the show! And what is up with Tara? Why is she such a jerk? If you love vampires, do yourself a favor and read the books and forget about this show. They don't do the books justice by any means.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	We bought this to be a family tradition for years to come,wish I would have researched about the price because this past weekend I saw it for 5$ cheaper at Sam's club.But we did receive it very quickly and did get free shipping on it as well.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham and his ventriloquist ""dummies"" are hilarious! You will begin to believe the puppets are real. He's the best ventriloquist I've ever seen....and I saw him Live here in Minneapolis."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	If you have spent any time on hwy 40 and rt 66, this movie will have meaning for you. It's a great movie for everyone in the family. Great colors, great sound, great graphics and awesome in every way.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	"Boy, I feel like I watched an entirely different movie based on all the positive feedback I've read.<br /><br />I really don't understand what has happened with the movie versions of the Potter series.  They have gotten progressively darker.  Literally.  The notice really began after the ""Goblet of Fire.""  They may as well have shot the movie in a cave for I felt like that is what I was watching.  I have read every book and anybody watching this movie who has not, would be totally lost.  Half the time I was trying to figure out exactly what was going on.<br /><br />All in all, a huge disappointment.  I keep buying the DVDs just so I have the entire series but this is one I doubt I would want to watch again.  Remember when Harry Potter was a ""kid's movie"" and was mystical and fun?  What happened?  I know they grew up and times became dark and troubled but I think it was taken a bit too far.  Perhaps Ron should have kept his Deluminator lit throughout the movie to ""shed some light"" on the action.<br /><br />Best movies of the bunch, in my opinion, are the first three.  ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", ""The Chamber of Secrets"" and ""The Prisoner of Azkaban.""<br /><br />After watching Part 1 of ""The Deathly Hallows"" I know what to expect in Part 2.  DARKNESS."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I have just ordered 2 copies of this DVD. The shorts were so good, (see www.expelledthemovie.com)and the reations against the movie from those with something to lose, makes me very impatient. I am waiting to see for myself whether Ben does as good a job as it seems, of exposing those who fail to deal with the substance of the ID debate, and instead attack the proponents and supporters.
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	Better than I thought it would be.  This documentary is very insightful will treading lightly on peoples ego's.  I believe everybody should watch this documentary.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Not just everything that a superhero movie should be, but also everything that a big block-buster summer movie should be too. Compelling story, incredible effects and inspired casting and performances, a must have for any DVD collection.
B002QZ1RS6	3.0	b	Let me  say this workout is way way over the top for cardio. I agree what Scott wrote about,if you haven't finished P90x don't even bother with this. I have done many cardio dvds before and never had to keep stopping to catch my breath.  I even saw some of his people in the video stopping and half doing it.  You will have to be in perfect shape for this. I had about 14 minutes left in the video so I stopped.  My pulse was beating so fast,and I got worried. Now it's a good video if you have the stamia to keep up. The video does tell you to go your own pace, but oh my, you will still pass out. I call it a quick, fast, stop for 30 seconds and back at it again cardio.  They named this dvd with the right title. I probably won't be doing this workout video. I will stick with what's best for my body.
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	The movie plays absolutely great, however the packaging was from some library. It looked like someone put it through the dishwasher before sending it. But no worries, the DVD player accepts it & so do I.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"Ben Stein does a great job presenting the truth.  It's really sad to see that a country that boasts about its ""Freedom of Speech"" can have so little tolerance when some exercise that right.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to everyone!"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"A very real film on our corrupt government & corportate driven food system. It's one that everyone should see (with their kids). We need to start unsing our ""three votes"" wisely!!"
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	I've now watched this movie three times and enjoyed it each time. For some people who've reviewed this, I think it is hard for them to imagine that such hope and such marriage repair is possible. They've seen so much hurt in their own families that this just seems like a dream. For those of us who've been part of churches and organizations that focus on helping people mend marriages we know that these things really do work. Marriages and lives are saved every day. If you are struggling with your own marriage and deep down you want to save it because you know it is somehow possible, then take a little time to watch this movie.<br /><br />Ok, so there is one professional actor, give them some credit.  This movie was produced without the millions being paid to professional actors but by individuals who are passionate about the topic. From my perspective they did a superb job. Keep up the great work!<br /><br />From a plot perspective you have a marriage on the rocks because the individuals neglected it. Divorce preparations soon follow. Because a caring father intervened and asked his son to wait forty days, change begins. The change culminates to a point where Caleb recognizes that he cannot do what he is doing without God. He is presented with a vivid illustration of what Jesus went through and goes through. He loved the world and gave Himself for it yet people reject him over-and-over. Because Caleb puts his entire heart and being into changing his relationship with his wife, she recognizes that his change is genuine and responds to it.  I'll leave the rest for the movie.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This DVD has been purchased 3 times and requested twice, so I have no doubt it is a much loved movie.  Amazon had the best price that I encountered.
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	This movie is so encouraging for relationships. I love that it shows you how things change when Jesus is first in your life. It can really touch your hearts, and make you feel like you need to makes changes. It has so much good detail, and a great story line. This movie can get very emotional. When i watched this movie for the first time i fell in love. I think this movie could help fix damaged relationships.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My husband and i loved it! My 11 year old son as well as my 14 month old son loved it, they were so excited about the animated cars.<br /><br />The first DVD i got in the mail from Amazon kept freezing up and skipping a section, i contacted them and they sent a new one right to us.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	I bought the DVD's because I had read and very much enjoyed the book.  The movie version gives a better picture of what the individuals looked like.  I also feel that I have a better idea of what they were thinking.  However, on balance, I liked the book a little better than the movie.  The way that John and Abigail expressed themselves in their letters to each other is so very articulate and caring and thoughtful and beautiful.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Anyone who is planning on getting married should see this movie before they take their vows.  Those that are having problems whether dating or married should also.  Families who are struggling with conflict with parents or siblings can also relate. Friends, who are true friends can be identified by the instructions show in this movie.  If we loose sight of our Creator, we loose sight of self.  If we really want to succeed, there is no half-way.  Very well done and you don't have be of any religious demonination to appreicate the uplifting values demonstrated by this movie.  I give it an A .. WELL DONE, A MOVIE TO OWN.
B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	"LEADER TIMES WEEKEND RELIGION ARTICLE FOR<br />Nov. 1, 2008 by Wm. YH. Scarle, 813-835-0129<br /><br />Ben Stein's film ""EXPELLED"" has been released for sale on DVD, so I have finally been able to see it.  Joan and I watched it last  Sunday afternoon and it deserves wide exposure.<br /><br />The documentary concerns the tyrannical conduct of academia in the matter of research and exposure of the theory of  ""intelligent design"" in biological science.  Stein interviews representative scientists who have been ridiculed, denied tenure, fired, blackballed and generally persecuted because they dared to make some positive motions toward the new research in intelligent design of biological entities, especially in the micro biological field.<br /><br />Of course, the real issue is Darwinianism.  You will notice that I have used a word which indicates a philosophical rather than a scientific position, because this is where the conflict lies.  Darwinianism has become the religion of many in the biological sciences.  Most, but not all, who follow Darwin's lead are atheists.  The theory of natural selection is their creation myth.  Nothing may be allowed to threaten this paradigm.  Thus they have established a new form of the Inquisition, this time using scientific orthodoxy as the rule, and academic disgrace as the punishment for failure to follow it.<br /><br />The interesting aspect of this debate is that the atheists who accuse the  ""intelligent design"" movement of being subversive  theologians rather than scientists use totally religious arguments to make their points.  The accusation is that  ""intelligent design"" is disguised religion, not science.  The way to make this point is to attack ID's science.  But, this is what the new village atheists can not do, because essentially their arguments have noting to do with science, but with anti-religion, or atheism.<br /><br />The first  line argument of these Darwinists is that there is no proof for the existence of God.  Since biological science is empirically based, that is it deals with the observation of physical reality, why would anyone expect physical proof for God, who is a spiritual person.  And here is the common sense core of the matter.  People like Richard Dawkins, the Oxford scholar who is the dean of the atheists, knows nothing of theology and very little philosophy.  He is totally ignorant of the field in which he writes his book, ""THE GOD DELUSION.""<br /><br />Dawkins is interviewed by Stein in the film, along with several other atheists.  Stein also interviews scholars who have been the victims of this latest form of the inquisition.  He also delves into the results of this kind of pseudo scientific tyranny as it effects culture, and is allowed to dominate society.  His segments on the Nazi regime and its ties with Darwinism are chilling.<br /><br />The subject is important because of the affirmation of the Darwinists that there is a battle between science and religion.  No such battle exists.  Almost all the pioneers of modern science were Christians, and nothing has changed that essential relationship.  There is a battle between world views that has nothing  directly to do with science.  It is because the atheists deliberately confuse this issue that Stein's film is an important contribution to our understanding.  It should be seen by the younger generation especially, so that the lens through which they view the world will be unclouded by the propaganda of the new inquisition.<br /><br />(Bill Scarle can be contacted at ravscarle@verizon.net).

B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	I liked the movie. I'm surely gonna buy the DVD, but why are there no engish subtitles? I sometimes need them as a german dude...
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	"The video quality of this DVD is appalling -- dark backgrounds often show very distracting rectangular blocking with an attendant lack of detail.  It does seem that the poor quality is probably a marketing attempt to drive sales to the Blu-Ray version -- the preceding movie in the Harry Potter series had far less difference in quality between the DVD and the Blu-Ray versions.<br /><br />In support of the ""marketing caused it"" theory, although the Deathly Hallows Part 1 DVD is a dual-layer disk, only a modest amount of the additional dual layer disk capacity is actually used -- using more of the available capacity would certainly have allowed better quality video."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"I watched Jeff Dunham's special on Comedy central.  And I can easily say that I have never laughed as hard as I did for any other comedian before.  I knew I had to get the DVD once I saw it.  I also bought his first special, which I think this one is funnier.  Walter and Peanut were the funniest in my opinion.  I was in tears laughing throughout the whole show.  If you like to laugh, then you must buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed. Thanks Jeff.<br /><br />Peanut:<br />""Je-fuh-fuh...dun-HAM...dot com!!!"""
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	If you like sexy vampires and are tired of the teen vampires this is a good show.  leaves you guessing till the end of the season.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	"This was a gift for my daughter despite it being too graphic in some parts.  She holds up a pillow to block out the once scene but she loves Indiana Jones so we gave it for Christmas.  Harrison Ford still ""has it"" - acting, bravado and good looks."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"This is quite simply one of the funniest comedy shows ever. Thanks, Jeff, for bringing ventriloquism back as an art form. The opening scenes showcase Dunham's talent as a pure stand-up comedian, then the puppets join him and they bring the show to a whole new level of insane comedy - and bring the house down in the process. From the cantankerous Walter to the smooth Sweet Daddy D, every character is unique both in sound and ""personality"". For me the highlight was the scene where Peanut and Jose talk in Spanish and Jeff protests that he feels left out because he ""doesn't speak Spanish"" - the line is great, the comedic timing is exquisite. The other part I loved most was the unscripted Improv-style pieces.<br /><br />I would recommend this for any adult with a love for the zany and witty."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"I have the DVD of this film and HAD to upgrade to Blu-Ray.  This movie was an instant Pixar classic from the moment the first bit was proceesed.  The CG animation is fantastic and the storyline will keep adults and children glued to their 103"" plasmas (or 56"" DLP in my case) from start to end. Action, adventure, emotion and kick a** hi-def... it's all packed into this must have Blu-Ray disc for you to enjoy, and to show off your high tech AV toys to your friends.  If you don't have it in HD, order it now.<br /><br />You're welcome. :)"
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Both of these products are a wounderfull addition to the collection even if you don't have a funny bone!!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This movie is EXCELLENT if you care about what you eat.  EVERYONE should be aware of these ideas and we should ALL work to change this.  Otherwise we need to put a warning label on the doors of all grocery stores
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	My son has never had a favorite movie until he watched this!  The characters are very intriguing and colorful.  The humor in it is great for kids of all ages.  It is a must have for any DVD collection.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I have played basketball, tennis, golf and soccer consistently throughout my life; I also attend a gym almost daily, live an active lifestyle and had a personal trainer for almost 3 months this past summer (longer than Insanity takes). I eat well (especially for a college student), but do drink a bit to cancel out some hard workout time. However, I have NEVER had results like I have with this DVD. I push myself when working out, especially when I'm with others who challenge me further, so this DVD set was right up my alley.<br /><br />Initially, the workout was a little intimidating and I had a hard time keeping up, but it was supportive to see that the workout was giving a good challenge even to people with ripped bodies - that told me that I would never get bored with this workout because I would always have something to work to. Plus there's always room to ""dig deeper!"" Furthermore, there's a woman in her 40's on his team - at 21 and in active shape I should be able to keep up!<br /><br />Shaun T presents a very intense, diversified and energetic workout that has left me feeling much stronger, more flexible and with greater stamina. Lastly, when I get out of a late class or work and the gym is closed, these DVDs are always ready to go no matter the time of day. I recommend this to any one looking for an incredible workout - as Shaun T would say, ""it's insanity!"""
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"Martin Scorsese may be the most beloved director for American cinephiles.  From his early triumphs to his later masterworks to his repeated Oscar snubs, Scorsese was always on the short list of Great American Directors.  Who hadn't heard some film nut wax poetic over Scorsese's tale of listening to the gangsters talking on the streets near his childhood home, ""so he knows how these guys talk!""  Who hadn't been reminded of his encyclopedic knowledge of American music and his mastery of soundtracks?  Who hadn't heard of the legendary violence in his movies?<br /><br />""The Departed"" was a seeming odd choice for Scorsese - it's a direct remake of the Asian blockbuster, ""Infernal Affairs.""  Indeed, if you have seen ""IA,"" as I have, you really have to question all the accolades that Scorsese and Team earned with this movie - including Scorsese's Oscar for Best Picture.  If there has been a greater example of a ""make up"" award, I can't think of one.<br /><br />The plot of ""IA,"" adopted by ""The Departed,"" is fantastic - a criminal organization has a mole buried deep in the metro police, and the police bury a mole deep in the criminal organization.  They are charged with finding each other while coping with this soul-crushing burden.  Both cops and criminals play for keeps - the body count is as high as the tension.  And cellular phones feature prominently in both films.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play the respective moles.  DiCaprio works for the police and gets close to mob boss Frank Costello, played with brio but not much originality by Jack Nicholson.  (Jack's played this role before, although his Boston accent is something new.)  Damon gets close to the top of the police food chain, populated with such talented actors as Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen.  There's plenty of testosterone to go 'round, especially when Damon and DiCaprio fall for the same police shrink.<br /><br />This is not a bad movie, and if you haven't seen ""IA"" before, you might think it's great.  However, there's something about watching a copy - even one as stylish and brutal as ""The Departed"" - that saps the experience."
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	"The first time I tried to watch this movie I turned it off after about 15 minutes.  The beginning of this film is one long torturous session with ""Lightning McQueen"" who is to me the most non endearing character ever in any Pixar movie.  One dumb gag and cliche after another, and some genuinely bad writing, like when McQueen says ""I'm a one man show"".  Hey, there is no ""man"" in the Cars universe, so why would a car say something like that?<br /><br />Thankfully I gave it another chance and decided to watch it on my little flatpanel while walking on my treadmill.  The movie starts to really move when it slows down.  The 116 minutes is considered by some to be too long, but it added a lot of time for character development, and McQueen needed to develop a lot of character.<br /><br />To be brief, the beautifully rendered little world of Radiator Springs and its assortment of cute -- if rather one dimensional -- characters provided a context for McQueen to accept responsibility for his actions, grow up, and start thinking of vehicles other than himself.  The Porsche saved the movie for me.  She at least had some depth.<br /><br />I liked ""Doc"" too.  His story added another lesson to the story, that is, don't discount those who came before you. They're smarter than you think.<br /><br />I found the ending rather predictable (I was sure what would happen, but I just didn't know exactly how it would happen), but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't yet seen the movie.<br /><br />So, three stars for a decent morality play and some mind bogglingly beautiful animation, and a tribute to motoring history.  Two stars off for shallow cliche characters (or should I say car-actors) and for having tons of eye-candy but a dearth of adult humor, and by ""adult"" I mean genuinly subtle and funny humor, not crass toilet humor.  With all it's strengths, Cars was a difficult movie for me to emotionally bond with, unlike the other Pixar films.<br /><br />Oh yeah, how is it that McQueen left Radiator Springs with whitewalls and that solid red and white paint pattern and then rolls out of Mac the next morning at the speedway back in his original paint, stickers, and tires.  Did I miss something?<br /><br />And, in real car racing you don't get to purposely collide with other cars and knock them off the track.  Chick Hick would have been banned from auto racing and likely charged with a felony in the real racing world.  They went so far to duplicate the realism of NASCAR, and I know cars sometimes touch, but it ain't supposed to be roller-derby, is it?<br /><br />The bonus featurs are fun, like the ""One Man Band"" cartoon and the extra ""Cars"" cartoon.  The ""deleted scenes"" are storyboard style but show how the movie could have been done differently, which I found quit interesting.<br /><br />Finally, this DVD just seems like ""round one"".  A year from now there will likely be the ""Special Two-Disc Ultra Ka-Chow"" version with multiple commentaries, documentaries, etc.  So, if you buy this version, I think you'll likely be buying Cars again."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is one of the funniest men around!  I love Peanut!  A must by video - you will want to watch it a few times!
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This is one of the most awesome movies ever made. It is pretty much perfect. It's definitely my favorite Superhero movie ever. Tony Stark is a man after my own heart. I would want to be him. I want to see a lot of iron man sequels. Iron Man man looks awesome and perfect and they give him a lot of really great poses. He also has the best flying sequences that I've ever seen. The visual artists who worked on this movie are certifiable geniuses! Seriously! I like Iron Man soooo much better than that wimpy, disgusting crybaby Spiderman (who should be called spiderwussy instead). Iron Man actually kills the bad guys, unlike Spiderwussy. Also Iron Man gets much hotter women than Kirsten Dunst (who is lame!). I think I would like about 20 sequels to Iron Man, at least!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is so good the first 121 minute that I think it is easily deservant of BEST PICTURE this year as it won, but what you have heard and read already about the ending is true.  I'm not gonna say exactly, but some how they pull it off, I think.  Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem were absolutely awesome.  They sold there roles so well and made me truly believe this is how this person was.<br /><br />One thing that stood out a lot was that every injury was so painful which sucked you in even more because I actually felt their pain.  I don't like getting into a story too much with my reviews because I don't want to effect someone's opinion of a movie too much before seeing it.  But I will say this movie is really, really good.  And about the ending, just accept it.  It is what it is.  THE COEN BROTHERS had a vision of this, and it came out the way it was supposed to come out.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	You don't need Hollywood to get a truly inspiring and life changing experience from this movie. It cuts to the heart of many marriages and gives hope, no matter what stage your relationship is in. It's not too late!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	This movie is definitely Shyamalan's best yet.  I don't really understand all the negative reivews.  Or maybe I do - too many people are so used to shallow face-paced modern movies that they can't handle a simple, well told story.  The movie does a great job of capturing the essence of the human feelings that drive each of the characters to do what they do, and overall I found it very satisfying, and believable.  Also, the script contains a lot of great lines, where it is not just what is said, but the peculiar way that it is said, that gives us deeper insight into how the characters' see the nature of their lives.  This is definitely one of my favorite movies in recent years.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"The 3d was excellent in IMAX 3D.  Throughout the movie, the 3d was phenomenal.  It wasn't like watching a 3D flick where you have double images at times, it was perfect throughout.  Sometimes I forgot I was actually watching a 3d film, but subconsciously knew I was, it was that good.<br /><br />As for the movie, it answered a great deal about the ""Pilot"" or ""Space Jockey"" species that we saw in the first film, maybe not everything.  Not all the questions that the Prometheus movie asked were explained in this film, but that's because Scott intends on doing a sequel, if Fox will fund it.  So in my opinion, what I went there for, I was extremely pleased.  Plus now it's like the franchise has been revitalized, just like the J.J. Abrams Star Trek reboot a couple years back. If anyone has done the research on this film like I have, there was much discussion about making this film, then another shortly after.  As an Alien fanatic, I would much rather have many questions unanswered and have a sequel, than have just one movie.  4 new hours of the Alien universe, vs 2 hours? I'll take 4 any day of the week.<br /><br />My only complaint about the movie would be the score.  If they would have make the score more like the original Alien, it would have seemed darker and more thrilling.  I'm no where near docking a point off my rating though just for some music, I much enjoyed everything else about the film and will be seeing it as much as I can while it's in theater.<br /><br />I'm not going in to the plot, because that would spoil it for those who haven't seen it.  But if you want to know more about the Space Jockey's, go see this film.  This film is also action packed.  There's very little character building, about 10 minutes in, the visuals are flying at you non-stop for the rest of the film.  Awesome!!!"
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"This is an outstanding film - one of the best in a so-so year for movies.<br /><br />But I totally agree with a reviewer below - ""staged releases"" of DVDs in standard, and then later, ""deluxe"" editions is a blatant attempt to milk the property for every drop of revenue that can be had.<br /><br />Oh, well.  The only thing we DVD consumers who love the special features can do it either wait and not take the bait, or take a complete pass.  With a movie this important, though, it's awful hard to hold back..."
B0006989TE	1.0	b	This is the slowest, most boring, and worst-acted movie I've ever seen.  The dialogue is terrible.  Shyamalan is a slave to his template format of a build-up followed by a twist.  This is such a terrible movie.  I wanted to turn it off while I was watching it.  And I guessed the lame-o ending.  Save yourself some time and money. I'm astounded at how bad this movie was.  And the fact that people actually enjoyed it only shows what a terrible world we live in.  Shyamalan deserves to be imprisoned for subjecting the public to this crap.  Trust me.  This goes beyond bad.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"Most of the negative reviews seem to be from those who have built up the mythos to the point that nothing could make them happy.  I loved the original ""Alien"" and the fact that this movie makes an attempt to explain a lot about the first movie is pretty cool.  What everyone seems to forget is that the original movie was made with no intention of anything more and I would have been happy if they had stopped there (can you honestly say you don't wish George Lucas would have done the same thing with ""Star Wars?"").  As a stand alone movie it's pretty cool.  A bit long, but I never found myself getting bored with it.  They did a good job of keeping things interesting.  If you have seen the other ""Alien"" movies then it will be pleasing in that it kind of explains why there are the aliens, not really what they are, but how they got there, or what their purpose was."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Cars is just fun.  Yes, it has a moral, but it is still a fun movie.
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	"Another in a long line of excellent films from Pixar. Perhaps a bit formulaic, but well executed and great fun to watch. The voice talents are excellent, the CGI is beautiful, the story is entertaining and the pacing is good, too. Perhaps not quite up to ""The Incredibles"" or the ""Toy Story"" levels, but very good nonetheless."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"This was a great movie.  The animation was top notch, both adults and children can be entertained by this film, and despite what some neysayers will tell you....there IS a story line.  Apparently the people that feel there is no story line couldn't grasp the simple message of ""take life slow and enjoy"".  The town of Radiator Springs used to be a hustle and bustle town.  But then a major freeway was opened up, which bypassed the town, saving commuters a mere 10 minutes.  We learned our lesson on our last road trip, we got off the main highway and took some alternate route, which lead us through small towns that we never saw from the main road.<br /><br />And as for the length and whatnot, MY 2 YEAR OLD SAT THROUGH THE WHOLE THING!  He just sat there and watched the screen through the entire 90 some minute flick.  If an 8 year old can't sit through this, then maybe their parents should limit their sugar intake and video games in hopes to regain their attention span.<br /><br />Overall, this is a GREAT movie.  Well put together, great messages behind it, lessons to be learned, and it is entertaining.  So don't listen to the negative comments because chances are, the neysayers have the attention span of a goldfish and couldn't understand the simple messages in the lessons Lightning McQueen learned: take life slow and enjoy, and that sometimes you need to think about others rather than yourself."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is a great comedian, as well as an amazin ventriliquist, (pardon my spelling). There is some risque jokes involved but nothing that ny child that is too young would get or nothing that a child old enough has not heard on any playground in the US. I would recommend this as a great sit down movie for the fam to get tother on a friday night!
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	Jeff Dunham kills it again with him and his puppets.  Hilarious dvd, highly reccomend for anyone who enjoys ventriloquism at it's best.

B001684L0A	5.0	b	"Each night I turned on the HBO feature anxious to see a good dramatic series, and learn about my country's struggle for life through one its most underrated founding fathers, John Adams.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti's performance in the title role is much in dispute as he, like many other actors, seems to play himself as much as his character. He turns from a loving father to the lawyer and representative who sometimes looks apoplectic rather than just an angry or fiery patriot. Much to his credit, I felt the John Adams of later years on subsequent episodes was extremely well-acted.<br /><br />Abigail Adams is played by Laura Linney, and her performance is superb and not the least in dispute. From the first moment, she is thoroughly credible as the vivacious lover, friend, confidante, advisor, and wife of John Adams. Her acting here should garner her an Emmy. The actors protraying Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson turned in stellar performances.<br /><br />Many complain that this did not follow the book of the same title, and  was not true to history exactly. To the first query the answer is what does? To the second, it is a well-written and well-acted drama that deserves our attention.<br /><br />The series begins with the Boston Massacre and John Adams representing the British soldiers. With his successful defense, he is noticed by the Crown, as well as the colonials who are striving for independence. Both want his services. Adams chooses independence over the king and we see him as representative, foreign minister, beggar and borrower, ambassador, vice president, and president. His one anchor through these assignments and occupations in the struggle of a new nation is his love and respect for his wife, Abigail whom he always refers to as ""my friend."" The letters between the two is one constant that sustains their love through loneliness of separation, as Mr. Adams is more often away than home.<br /><br />Particularly touching is the drab existence they share in an uncompleted White House, the grief John Adams suffers from the loss of his Abigail, his renewed friendship with Thomas Jefferson, and his dying belief that his friend survives him, even though Jefferson died three hours earlier. In one of the ironies of our history, both men died exactly fifty years to the day, after July 4, 1776.<br /><br />This story ends with both Abigail and John Adams quoting letters of their love for each other and a young nation, as they ascend a hill together and look out over their country. They hope that they will be able to see future generations of Americans, from heaven, and wonder if they will deserve the sacrifice and freedom they have given them.<br /><br />So do I."
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"Much like what can be called Shyamalan's sophmore slump UNBREAKABLE, this is one of those ""watch it once"" movies since you can only really enjoy this movie once, and UNBREAKABLE at least was a bit of a surprise.  Shyamalan is a great talent, someone who wants to make movies with real characters, action and thrills, but his well is running dry and if he doesn't dig deeper he may lose his fans to the next new talent with a cool idea for a film.<br /><br />THE VILLAGE is one of those ""best looking bad movies"" a movie where the plot and the story is so lame or predictable (the plot came to me as I was thinking of old commercials for tv shows like Alien Autopsy and Discovering the Titanic, think about it or email me if you want my insight on this) but the rest of the movie is beautiful with a good atmosphere and characters you like, remember and can believe.  The movie almost depends on the characters too much to fill in the holes where we are expecting to see the monsters jump out on you and shock.  I don't mind seeing movie characters talk and discuss things be it the problem at hand or their lives but when your watching a movie where it's billed as a thriller where these characters will be in peril or in trouble (much like SIGNS) and your given something else, it's a buzzkill of sorts.  You sit down wanting a cheeseburger and you get grilled chicken, yeah it's good, but not what I wanted or expected.<br /><br />Thats another problem with the movie and it's happened before with movies where in the commercials show you all the good parts.  If you've seen the commercials you've seen all the best parts, and if the thriller elements are all your interested in, then you gotta pass.  There are a couple more that weren't shown and they were only okay.<br /><br />I can lay down a good law for movies right now and this goes right back up to my first paragraph, ANY movie where you can see the ending coming and your correct about it, will more then likely dissapoint you and if it's a twist ending that you see, double the dissapointment, (triple it if the movie telegraphs its ending a mile away twist or no).  Hopefully Shyamalan's next movie will be better, or at least live up to what the commercials show us."

B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	I'm not going to go into details of the movie that have been commented on many, many times here but just the 3D disc itself and I can't say enough about it. I felt it was done remarkably well. It wasn't overused to be totally distracting or disjointed but carefully enough to give the depth  as needed. A couple days after watching the 3D version I went back and watched the Blu-ray disc - I was so enthralled by the 3D version that I let myself become too absorbed in some of the effects to concentrate on the movie and had to watch the Blu-ray version to view the movie. This was not the fault of the movie, prooducers or so on, this was the first 3D movie I got and viewed on my new 3D TV so it was an entirely new experience for me and I got lost in paying more attention to the effects than concentrating on the program.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	My girlfriend and I loved this movie. We were always on the edge of our chairs, until it was over. We can't wait for the next one! Watch it, you will love it too.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"If you look at movies for what they're intended to be instead of what you think makes a ""really great"" movie, Iron-Man is one of the best of it's ilk.<br />Fast paced, incredible effects, a story line with just enough techno-Babel to aid suspension of disbelief...  Everything you need for a mindless fun an good flick.<br />I love (most of) the Marvel super hero films and have to say this one left me only wanting it to keep going.<br />fun fun fun..."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	My husband and I saw Jeff Dunham on Comedy Central and couldn't stop laughing.  Since then, we have seen Dunham's act in person and now have purchased his DVD.  Not only is he funny, but he makes the puppets come to life.  You will totally forget that he is the voice behind the puppets...he's that good.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	This movie is one of the best movies of super-hero I have ever seen. The DVD works pretty well. It is missing some extra features that should come in the double-disc version.<br />But the price made this version my choice.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I've always loved Harry Potter, and even though it's different than the book the movie is a great interpretation of the book. It shipped quickly and I'm happy with my purchase.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I laughed until I cried watching this DVD. Dunham and his characters are quite a team-each with their own unique ""style,"" and sense of humor. My favorite was Walter-he just kinds of says things most of us want to say but don't dare.<br /><br />A few years ago I saw Jeff perform in Branson, Missouri. I had never heard of him until that time, and thought his live act was hilarious. I've been looking for him ever since, and was glad to find this DVD.<br /><br />This DVD comes highly recommended by me for anyone who just needs a good belly laugh!"
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	Arrived in reasonable time and in the promised condition.  I thought the shipping and handling charges were high.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"I've heard--and read--so many disparaging remarks regarding superhero movies, as if they're somehow inferior to ""real"" movies--what is a REAL movie, anyway? A low-budget indie full of miserable people? I think the characterization in Iron Man, like the Spider-Man franchise, is very good. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark/Iron Man. No one else could have brought this character to life as he has. The supporting cast is excellent. The story is true to the comic book--or is it ""graphic novel"" now? I'm never quite sure! The story never bogs down. The special effects are spectacular. Marvel was wise to take the reins on this one.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars instead of five because I was disappointed to find, in all the extras included in the 2-disc set, there was no BLOOPER REEL!!!!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"Let me just start with the results--In 60 days I lost 28lbs and 27.25 inches from all over my body including almost 6 inches from my waist! And this was without sticking the the diet portion. Isn't that Insane!?!<br /><br />If you think, ""I'm fairly in shape, how hard could this be?""  Pretty d*mn hard! My 16 year old athlete brother who started with me quit after a day, saying it was too hard. I was SO out of shape and this just proceeded to kick my butt. It was the hardest workout I've ever done! It's a combination of sports drill circuit training that will leave you SOAKED every day. I was sweating as much on day 60 as day 1. It never gets easier, you just get stronger!! No weights, just you pushing your body to it's limits 6 days a week. I NEVER skipped a day; as hard as it was, I made the commitment and never missed a workout, even if it required me working out at 2 a.m.!! It was the only fitness program I've ever stuck to. I can fit clothes I haven't been able fit since 2008!  I've had this cute pair of designer jeans, tags still attached that I could never fit that I tried on and can finally button! I feel like so much more of a women now that I've gotten some semblance of a shape back!<br /><br />I can't wait to get my Insanity T-shirt because I definitely earned it!! Shaun T and the crew is the great, BTW!! Come on y'all let's GOOOOOO!!!!<br /><br />TIPS:<br />-Drinking 64oz + water a day is very necessary because you sweat SO much! If you don't drink a lot of water you will be dehydrated<br />-It's harder to do this workout on carpet, but also be careful with ceramic tile because your sweat makes the floor super slippery...Seriously, that's how much you sweat, you may slip on your own sweat!!!<br />-Ladies--a good sports bra is really important (maybe two!) because the jumping is so intense!<br />-You need something for recovery because you are pushed to your limits but I didn't buy the recovery formula from Beachbody, I used chocolate milk (Instant breakfast or Ovaltine); it's what athlete's use.<br />-Sometimes to switch it up, I used the No Music option and played my iPod instead, my favorite party songs helped me push harder<br />-Only do YOUR MAX, I promise I still barely make it through the warm-up yet even with all the breaks and resting, I still managed to lose a ton of weight<br /><br />You can do it, dig deeper! Insanity works for you if you work for it. Round 2 here I come!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"Cars is about the only feature length movie that my little kids can watch without having to be afraid that the main character(s) are going to be killed.  How is it that so many ""kids"" movies feature scene after scene of the animated characters (usually animals) running for their lives under the threat of death?  ""Finding Nemo"" coming to mind right away.  Not only all that issue, but the movie starts with the mother and all of Nemo's siblings getting killed.  Do children really need to contemplate this possibility?  I also checked out ""A Bug's Life.""  The grasshoppers are really scary, threaten the life of the little ant, Dot, and also plan to kill the reigning Queen.  Then there's the scene with the bird trying to eat them.  And of course the end where Flick maneuvers Hopper into a location so that he can get captured by a bird, and then - of all things! - fed to the baby birds.<br /><br />I really don't understand why kids movies, in general, feature that kind of ""life and death"" tension.  Plenty of adult movies don't have those themes and are nonetheless compelling.  And that's what we have with Cars.  No one is trying to kill anyone - whew!  And although Chick Hicks is ""the bad guy"" and ""a meanie,"" he's only is a small portion of the movie.  And the aggressive stuff he does is pushing and shoving the other cars, which isn't great, but at least it's not some animated animal punching, kicking, biting, and/or stomping on another.  Chick Hicks aside, the main storyline of the movie is about Lightening McQueen's personal growth and what he learns about friendship and life.  These are an appropriate topics for children to consider, in my opinion!  These are issues that I expect my children to confront in their own lives, unlike (God willing) running for their lives and/or getting beaten senseless and/or losing family members to acts of violence and/or engineering a situation that results in the death of their ""enemies.""<br /><br />In summation, I wish there were other great, high quality movies out there that can appeal to kids (and adults!) without resulting to violence and death as motivating factors for the characters.  Cars proves that we can be motivated by other things than these, such as what it means to have a friend and be a friend."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I am very pleased with this transaction. Movie received in good condition and my child has proceeded to wear this movie out. He asks to see it every day sometimes twice a day.
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	A disapointment.  Not without some merit, but not close to the Ridley Scott's greatest works.  No Blade Runner, or even Alien, here.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	If you have not seen this, it will be the best $11 with shipping you will ever spend.  In fact, you should buy the second one now, because if you order one for yourself, you will be ordering another!
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"July hasn't been a good month for the movies.<br /><br /> After DC Comic fans wouldn't go see Halle Berry ham it up in a stupid S & M outfit and thus, witnessing the apocalyptic catastrophe, &quot;Catwoman&quot; rightfully crash and burn at the box office (a pathetic 3rd Place opening with $17 Mil, finishing behind the tepid &quot;I, Robot&quot;, a film that opened the week before it), &quot;The Village&quot; is a damn good breath of fresh air.<br /><br /> I did something before seeing this movie that I don't normally do: I read just about every critic's review of the film. I hate doing that for several reasons. For one, I always have their thoughts in my head and always find the faults they point out are magnified ten times larger than normal, two, I don't like spending time talking about other critics and three, I don't want to go in with any sort of expectations other than what I saw in the trailers and T.V. spots. I remedy all of this by just reading little quips or by-lines and then wait until I've seen the movie.<br /><br /> If you haven't read the reviews of this film, most have been highly critical of director M. Night Shyamalan who, after doing two weak movies, reloaded and turned out the fantastic ghost story, &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. Somehow, in all his success, Night set himself up to fail. That film was so good and the twist at the end so mind-blowing, that he couldn't possibly live up to future releases. ""Unbreakable"" was a wonderful film giving us a glimpse of the mythical ""hero's journey"" and ""Signs"", while not very good, was effective in at least building tension before it finally petered out with no payoff.<br /><br /> So now, after you've read all of the above (I told you I hate getting into what critics think), let's turn to ""The Village"" (opening this weekend).<br /><br /> ""We are thankful for the time we have been given,"" says Edward Walker (William Hurt) in monotone, addressing his people, who are gathered for lunch/dinner at a few long wooden tables. He ends there, seemingly trailing away from what he wanted to say. Already, there is a tense energy in the air. Something isn't right. Before this, one of the townspeople buried their child. Victim, apparently, of a gang of creatures that live in the woods surrounding the isolated and puritanical village-town of Covington, Pennsylvania. Run by a group of ""elders"" headed mostly by Walker and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver), they inform their people that they do not stray into the woods and the creatures do not go into Covington. Their loud and eerie howls fill the air, causing the townspeople's nerves to be on edge. Only the seemingly-crazed Noah Percy (Adrien Brody in a thankless role) seems to find humor and laughs outloud at the noises coming from the forest beyond...<br /><br /> In response to the town's recent death, Alice's fearless son, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) announces to the elders that he wants to go into the woods and obtain medicine from a neighboring town. He does so, against their wishes, but is witnessed by one of the creatures to be in their territory. Because of this, all hell breaks loose. The creatures come into town, leaving red marks on every door of every building. Animals are found skinned with twisted necks.<br /><br /> Through all this, Alice addresses the nervous townsfolk, telling them, ""we must remain vigilant""...familiar words, especially in light of current world events.<br /><br /> If this isn't enough, Edward's blind daughter, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) has fallen for Lucius because he shares the same traits she carries. He is brave and he knows how to handle himself. He's also very morose and serious and doesn't speak much. This makes him a poor match for Edward's other daughter, Kitty, who was shot down by Lucius after she (embarrassingly) confessed her love for him. It isn't until another tragedy befalls the town that Ivy takes it upon herself to try and learn the mysteries of the woods by continuing Lucius's quest. In doing so, however, she may unlock something a lot darker and more sinister.<br /><br /> Giving anything else away would be grounds for my arrest, trial, and execution.<br /><br /> This movie is brilliant. It's Shyamalan's finest film since ""The Sixth Sense"" and exactly what ""Signs"" should have been: smartly written, incredibly clever, beautifully shot, and actually creepy. There is no gore in this film (save for one scene with Brody, but it's minor) and there shouldn't be any gore. Everyone who was expecting a slasher-film came to the wrong movie...looking at Shyamalan's history, you would think that moviegoers would learn that, but no, they continue to complain.<br /><br /> The only problem I had with the movie was the cardboard acting. Everyone seems to be on auto-pilot as they walk through their lines as if they're going through a cold-reading in rehearsals. The only time this works is with Hurt, who expresses so much through his eyes and facial expressions, Phoenix, who seems like he has a chip on his shoulder and Weaver, who seems to be both tired and worried. The actress who steals the show is Bryce Dallas Howard. As Ivy, she is very much human and has fears and worries like the rest of her neighbors. However, she is also driven and keeps cool mainly because she has the luxury of not having her eyesight.<br /><br /> Like all of Night's other films, this one is also leisurely-paced but there's always that underlying tension that gives the film its wings and because of that, it's not boring. Like Rod Serling before him, Shyamalan retains his skill of stringing you along and then trapping you when you least expect it. Again, I won't spoil the ending, but once it's revealed, you may realize that you are actually a PART of the town of Covington and that thought will haunt you long after you leave the theater.<br /><br /> ***1/2 out of ****<br /><br /> --Matt"
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I was impressed at the breadth of the perspective on the issue of whether Intelligent Design Theory actually is scientific theory.  This documentary uses direct interviews with esteemed academicians, relatively unknown professionals, and some political activists involved in the issues around Intelligent Design.  It is shown that whereas Evolution Theory was once roundly opposed by the large majority of society, Evolution Theory has become almost axiomatic among contemporary scientific/politic cross-sections of society.  The first portion of this documentary, which comprises about 80% of the play-time, is a secular investigation of what actually is behind the various positions on Intelligent Design.<br /><br />The last portion of this documentary involves application of theology to secular ethics: if Evolution Theory is taken to extremes then what might be the overall social/political results?
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	Yet another great DVD from Jeff Dunham.  Hilarious act and hilarious jokes.  Jeff Dunham is truly one of the funniest stand-up comedians today.
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	Let me begin by saying that I am one of millions that agree too much was cut from the book when the movie was made. To me, it's completely idiotic to take the longest book of the series and make it into the shortest of all 8 movies. Especially considering how horrible a job they did with HP & the Deathly Hallows Pt 1 & 2. And they spilt the movie into two parts! There was so much they could've done with this movie. One of the long standing arguements has always been there's no way they could have put out a 3-4 hour movie. BS! Show me one HP fan who would not have willingly sat through a four hour HP movie! LOL. That said, here are my vies on the movie. I've broken them down into different sections.<br /><br />CASTING: Overall, I've almost always agreed with the casting for the characters for the movies, not just this one. Umbridge/Imelda Staunton= Brilliant! I actually had to remind myself it was the character I detested and not Staunton herself, she played the character so well. Luna/Evanna Lynch= One of the best casting choices in all eight movies! Lynch IS Luna! Sirius/Gary Oldman= I'll just come out and say it. Everything Gary is involved in turns to gold. Actors like Gary Oldman only come around once in a lifetime. Snape/Alan Rickman= The reason this man is a magnificent actor, one of the best in history, in the world, is because he's a camilleon. No two roles he plays are the same. Rickman drowned himself in the character of Snape. So well, he played it perfectly. Some of my other choices for great casting were: McGonagall/Maggie Smith, Dumbledore/Michael Gambon, Trelawney/Emma Tompson, Voldemort/Ralph Fiennes, Kingsley/George Harris, Lucius Malfoy/Jason Isaacs, Hagrid/Robbie Coltrane. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, perhaps the best casting choice, Bellatrix Lestrange/Helena Bonham Carter! She was outstanding! As for the poor choices, or the ones that I think could have been played a bit differently, not necessarily a different actor. Harry's parents, the Dursley Family, Tonks and Remus, Fred and George Weasley, Draco, Neville and Molly Weasley.<br /><br />CG: Let's face it, the jury is not out on this. All the animated scenes, such as the Ministry of Magic with the globes, the flying scenes, Grawp, when the centaurs run off with Unbridge, exc.<br /><br />CUT SCENES: Lets face it, they butchered the book. This was a book where everything changed, a pivotal book. The movie was in essence a slap in the face to all HP fans. The cutting of certain scenes were very poor choices. Such as: Hermione's attempt at freeing all house elves, quidditch, the St Mungo's scenes, the Occlumency scenes between Snape and Harry, everything that is Grimmauld Place and the Department of Mysteries, Dumbledore's escape when accused by Fudge and Umbridge of forming the D.A., and so on. But the worst of all, is the simple dismissing of Sirius. In the book it's a truly heartbreaking scene. But in the movie? His death barely gets acknowledged, you can't hear Harry's anguished screaming, using the Avada Kedavra curse on Bellatrix, Lupin's attempt at calming Harry.<br /><br />In all, the book got a 6 out of 5 stars. The movie got a 3 out of 5 stars.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	I do plan to watch this again to see if I can make any sense of it after all. But I am getting real doubts about it. Reviews are saying almost everything under the sun about it. It is a straightforward thriller. It is hopelessly confusing. Those who don't get it tried to view it as a thriller when it isn't a thriller at all. The twist ending is obviously predictable from the start. The twist ending is so confusing that the whole thing makes no sense. M. Night Shyamalan's twist endings are growing old and he should quit putting them on his films. Only his first film really had a twist ending. His others, including this one, don't. The twist ending is what makes the movie great. The twist ending disappoints us by undermining what the movie appeared to be all about. The twist ending is supposed to undermine our expectations and exasperate us -- that's the point. It is set in the present day. It is set in 1892. Whew? What is with this movie after all? I might figure it out by watching it again.  I might be thrilled by the non-existent twist ending of this non-thriller. I might remember not to be scared by this non-horror movie that I failed to get the first time around around because expecting it to be horror ruins it. But I'm scared just thinking about the task of trying to relate to this movie in the right way. I'm on the edge of my seat with curiosity about this twist ending, and about whether it even exists or not -- the twist ending, that is, that I have to just sit back, relax, and not think about in order to get the movie and what it is really about. Can I do it? I'm gonna try, I promise, I'm gonna try.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is the funniest thing I've seen since Jerry Seinfeld made me laugh. Jeff Dunham is so talented and amazing. I highly recommend all of his DVDs and if you can, see him live in person. He tours all over the country. I can't say enough about him. He gets away with saying things that no one says but they are thinking it.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	i would just like to point out that i saw this movie three times in the theaters. i love it. now for anyone who has looked through the special features portion of the DVD i would like to direct your attention to the gallery picture number '11'. there is just something terribly funny about what lies ABOVE the mans belt, it reminds me of something else. :-) anyway terribly good movie. peace.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Alan Ball's heavy, worldly, realisitic material (Six Feet Under, Amercan Beauty) always had elements of fun, fantasy, and sexuality. So what would happen if Ball took on a show based on a series of southern gothic fantasy-romance-horror novels?<br /><br />True Blood is a freakin blast. It's fun, it's sexy, it's thrilling, it's over-the-top, it's engrossing, and totally addictive. By increasing the roles of the supporting characters in Charlaine Harris' equally addictive novels, Ball has managed to create an true ensemble show which combines the sexy and supernatural with Ball's trademark depth and social commentary.<br /><br />Obviously creative liberties needed to be taken in order to turn the books into a series, but I doubt Charlaine Harris is irked. This show could have easily been a cheese-tastic CW mess, but with Oscar-winning Anna Paquin playing Sookie Stackhouse, Ball at the helm, and quality-driven HBO as the host, I don't see how the series could have possibly turned out better.

B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	Sin City is an empty, hollow, incoherent, poorly edited, pathological piece of snuff porn; it tries to gloss over this with lots of beautiful camera work, but it's just like putting a silk dress on a rotting corpse. Each of this movie's stories are  so morally childish they seem as if they were written by sixth-graders. None of them are truly coherent, nor do they make any real sense; there is an almost total lack of real human emotions, motivations, etc., that would explain the Road Runner-like violence. The acting is so hammy and heavy-handed that even if it were intended as a satire on the whole film-noir shtick, it still fails miserably. The horrendously bad dialogue would have been funny if it wasn't for the film's violence, which, by itself, speaks volumes about its creators as well as the people who praise this stinking piece of trash. Great stuff, if you think like Lynndie England.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	"I agree with the reviewers who say this movie is destined to be an all time Christmas classic.  The Polar Express is an excellent movie with a great message, effects and sound.  I recommend this movie to everyone.  With that said, I believe we're here to review the sale of this particular disc set (The Polar Express Presented in 3-D (2004) for $7.79), not the movie itself.  If you're looking to buy The Polar Express in 3D, don't bother buying the disc set that states ""Presented in 3D"" on the front cover.  This is not true 3D.  It comes with 4 pair of passive 3D glasses; which will just give you a headache the first two minutes of viewing.  I tried using the Active 3D glasses from my Sony Theater system, but they just kept turning off because there was no 3D signal coming from the sync transmitter; an indication this disc is not 3D.  Another disappointment was that there were some scenes missing between the two disc included in this set.  We viewed both discs and found that each disc contained some scenes the other disc didn't have.  For these reasons I am only giving this purchase one star; because I didn't get what I thought I purchased.  I blame myself for not reading the reviews before purchasing.  This experience is a reminder that ""You Only Get What You Pay For"". .I should have realized that $7.79 was not going to get me this great movie in 3D."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I really enjoyed this movie. Great message and some powerful emotional moments (even though the production quality is not up to movies costing millions more to make). Some moments of good humor as well. Looks great on Blu-ray.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This is THE most hilarious comedian out there!  Absolutly fabulous.  The amazing way he makes eye contact with his puppets, and performs perfect timing, it's incredible to see!  I am hoping more DVD's and a CD will follow soon.<br /><br />Thanks Jeff, for finally offering some real comedy!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	My kids LOVE Trains and we have the book.  They love it and watch it all year long.  The love when the train is on the ice.  Great animation.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I saw Iron Man at the theaters so I pre-bought a copy of the DVD to enjoy again at home.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"Its too bad this film has gotten so many negative reviews since it has confounded so many people's expectations.  The common criticism I've heard about this film is that people seem to really like the movie until the ""twist"" or ""secret"" is revealed.  People said they felt ""cheated"" and it was a let down.  Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen the movie I'll just say his movies (and this movie in particular) need to be seen like a feature length episode of the classic Twilight Zone TV series.  It might not be classified as horror.  It might or might not be sci-fi.  And it might or might not be a work of fantasy.  Like Rod Serling's classic series M. Night Shyamalan's films go beyond easy classification.<br /><br />Perhaps The Village and his other films may or may not compare favorably to Rod Serling's most memorable Twilight Zone episodes but I certainly appreciate the creative effort in bringing this kind of modern ""fairy tales"" for adults.  This movie is about a group people who have chosen to seperate themselves from the corrupting influences of mainstream society.  And the lengths they go through in order to maintain their ""ideal"" society; despite the dangers that exist beyond the woods.  This was the story M. Night Shyamalan wanted to tell and I believe he succeeded brilliantly."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"Good movie!  Nice that is shows how ludicrous ""stardom"" and entitlement can be and then over the course of the movie he begins to care for others and not just himself.  Plot is nice and the kids LOVE this movie!"
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Spiderman the director took to many Liberty's with it, the reason how he can crawl up walls and stuff don't get me started on that. The Hulk both of them bite. The Christopher Reeve Superman's ummmm ya. Well the list goes on, but I think that this was one of the most faithful creations of a DC/Marvel comic movie conversion. Yes they did take a few liberty's but it's Hollywood what do you expect.<br /><br />I think that Robert Downey Jr. was a good choice I just hope that he can stay out of trouble long enough to make the sequel they left the movie open for. Lot's of action in this movie some good CGI but yet not a slap you in the face CGI.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is Jeff's best dvd yet.  We use his comedy daily in our lives to keep us playful.  I recommend this dvd and his others to anyone who has a sense of humor.  It was a great gift.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	it is great because you can keep the blu ray for the collection and give the kids the dvd to destroy lol
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"My family LOVED this movie!! I am convinced Tom Hanks can do no wrong. He is perfect for his ""roles"", and watching this movie, you can really feel that he is a dad too...that he bore that in mind when making the decision to make the film, and during his performances in this film (albeit animated (CG'D) performances). There are some thrilling edge-of-your seat moments that some smaller viewers may find a little too tense, but it is like I say, THRILLING! I am down-right giddy with regard to this movie's arrival on DVD. Josh Groban's voice is spectacular on the soundtrack, which is also worth parting with a few of your hard-earned dollars in order to own and enjoy for Christmases to come! Don't leave this dvd on the shelf when it comes out. You'll want it at your fingertips whenever you are in the mood for a holiday classic!"
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	The annoying thing about this flick was the over and over and over again F word -- everybody overuses it in this picture.<br /><br />Other than that the film is brutal and bloody. The action without the F word is excellent as usual as DiCaprio and Damon as well as Nicholson of course are doing an excellent job, and so does Wahlberg, Baldwin and the rest of the cast -- they are all good.<br /><br />It's a like a modern-day Gangs of New York in a sense. The photography is also great and very graphic, and the soundtrack fits the mood. And the script, except for the F word (half of the dialogue) is also good.<br /><br />Needless to say it's a guy movie and most chicks will be bored to death. Do I recommend this movie? Because of the misuse and overuse of the F word absolutely NOT. You'll live with just seeing the trailer.<br /><br />I don't know why top directors like Scorsese have to resort to this kind of production when they could do just so much better without the use of the F word -- it's weird.<br /><br />The story is about a rat inside the Boston PD and/or MA State Police, and a rat inside a mobster's inner circle. One is hunting the other and apparently nobody can be trusted.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This was another great purchase and a great experience all around with amazon.  It is a pleasure to find yet new, unopened products and having a great experience with a hassel free experience.  Thanks again, it was a pleasure.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	Six months ago when the trailers were released for suspense-master Shylaman's new film, fans and non-fans alike were looking forward to being scared senseless by the creatures that live in the woods beyond the borders of the happy little Pennsylvania village that is the setting of &quot;The Village&quot;.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, the acting is the most frightning thing about this dull, uneventful spin on Little House on the Prarie. Oscar winner Adrien Brody fares the worst as village idiot Noah Percy, who stumbles about mumbling to himself much of the time. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a deadpan performance as Lucius Hunt, the young man intrigued by the cloak-wearing, overgrown porqupine-looking creatures that lurk in the woods. Seasoned veterans Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt are completely wasted in their roles as as elders of the small town. Though the performances are terrible; actors are only as good as the dialogue they speak, which is laughable.<br /><br /> Shylaman, credited as writer, poducer, and director; clearly bit off more than he could chew with this one. The quality of his films has clearly gone downhill since his &quot;Sixth Sense&quot; hayday. Perhaps this supposed master of suspense will deliver a coherent story next time, but until then, don't make the mistake of paying this Village a visit.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This was a great movie. Awesome story, awesome acting, great special effects and who doesn't love a superhero?! This looked great on blu-ray. I did have a small issue with the movie slowing down on my ps3 but I think i've determined that its a hardware problem on my end, not any fault of the disc itself. I would still reccommend this even with my tiny slowing down problem.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This box set was a new set and came in perfect condition at a great price and came in a very timely manner.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"Eye opening movie about the state of food production and the industry that has grown up around delivering this basic need.  You only get one body, and at least in the near term, we only get one planet.  We better start acting like good stewards of God's Creation.  This is not a shunning of capitalism, nor science, it is the lack of a good feedback loop in the process of improving food delivery.<br /><br />I buy organic, not just because I think the organic methods are always better, it is because of the additional scrutiny in the process of the delivery of the food.  I think that companies built around quality make a better model of how products should be produced.  I think they treat their workers better, take more care in the creation of the food since they know the ""organic"" label is valuable, and they treat their animals better.  Labeling is what allows consumers to vote with their dollars.<br /><br />It is indefensible to think we are not allowing food to be labelled properly and allow the end consumer to know what they are buying!  This is the feedback loop to tell the producers what the consumers expect.  The ""Free Market"" does not work when the labeling is insufficient to allow for this essential feedback loop.  Our government is corrupt, without a doubt, and we need more accountability and transparency in this process.<br /><br />The Monsanto lawsuits are the most disturbing thing in this movie, I agree that a company can protect their patents for a period of time, to allow for fair compensation, but using the legal system to financially subjugate individuals that participate in the food delivery chain is a perversion of the law!  This is very disturbing, this may be why we have the second amendment.<br /><br />Our government is a product of the populace, Thomas Jefferson put it best ""Whenever people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government"" -TJ<br /><br />We are responsible, we the voters must assert our rights to good food, humanely raised food, good governance is our responsibility.  We can not just blame big business or capitalism, or our government.  We are the government, we are big business, we are capitalists.  We have a soul and we are not just animals, we should act like it.<br /><br />Thank you for this movie, God bless."
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Snow White is a film I didn't see in theaters. It's not that fairy tale films don't appeal to me, its just that I didn't want to watch a film about Kristen Stewart. I was completely wrong, I should have given this film a chance because now that I've seen it at home I think it's FANTASTIC!<br /><br />Albeit, there are problems but the film really works where it needs to. This is not the story of Snow White, this is the story that surrounds Snow White. It really should have been called The Queen and the Huntsman, or Snow White and the Queen... because in either case, the Queen, played to perfection by the gorgeous Cherlize Theron, is the real, central figure to this film.<br /><br />Snow White and the Huntsman begins with the typical telling of Snow White. Snow's real mother is walking in the snow, pricks her finger and three drops of blood fall to the ground while she imagines having a baby. I would expect visuals like this so it starts off pretty well. As it flows we get into the awesome scenes with Cherlize... I mean the Queen.<br /><br />Snow's mother dies and soon after a ferocious army of orc-like creatures attacks the Kingdom. Snow's father, the King, defends his Kingdom and easily defeats the army of warriors that cracks to pieces when hit by swords. Okay.... After the army's defeat the King finds a beautiful woman locked up in a wagon and immediately falls in love with her. IMMEDIATELY marries her the next day because.... she is a witch! Using her beauty as a spell to lure powerful men to herself, it's Cherlize Theron taking over the Kingdom! There is a beautiful marriage scene and then, before you know it, Cherlize, now the Queen, kills the King, murders anyone who stands in her way (really, the imagery is not for kids) and with the help of her strangely obvious, perverted brother, takes the Kingdom.<br /><br />From this point on the film is just short of amazing. We see the young Snow White as a now youthful Kristen Stewart and the film chooses to keep her dialogue to a sweet minimum (good choice). When she does speak, its useful and not annoying. We see the stark difference between the evil, beauty stealing Queen (she sucks the beauty out of any woman, not the YOUTH, but the beauty. If you're an ugly gal, you're pretty much safe from the Queen) and the beautiful, genuine innocence of Snow White. Snow White, locked in a tower (and it looks rough, really) is praying the Our Father in a hushed whispering tone and I'm simply blown away. Not many producers or directors would show a character praying these days. It was really refreshing and really set the tone of the film.<br /><br />The film tackles all the Snow White tent poles while giving us amazing imagery from the evil Queen and her just as evil brother without messing with the crux of the Snow White story. Hemsworth as the impossibly handsome Huntsman is a good addition to the story, and the impossible situation that brings the Huntsman and Snow White together is not toyed with as in usual Hollywood films... they know they are in a bad situation and do not use humor to break the mood. The Prince of the story, the son of a Duke fighting the Queen, is actually just as amazing as the rest of the characters. He is a fighter, a kind of Emo Legolas who can actually walk the walk.<br /><br />The film does have problems, most notably the large cast of characters gives almost no time for the seven dwarves to have good development and they almost seemed like an unneeded addition to the story... which is weird, since it used to be Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.<br /><br />Several moments seemed rushed (the aftermath of the infamous, spell breaking Kiss wasn't very climatic for me) and the romance was really left up in the air (bummer for Huntsman).<br /><br />However, the Queen with all her evil awesomeness, her amazing outfits, her flawless performance and even sympathetic life is really the heart of this story. And its worth a good watch.<br /><br />I really enjoyed it, despite the recent news of the actors bad life decisions which kind of hurt the movies reputation I think.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart is really alright in this film. Not exactly the greatest but she pulls off the innocence remarkably well. One or two of the dwarves will knock your socks off, Hemsworth is amazing, as always. Cherlize Theron steals the show, but all in all, Snow White and the Huntsman is a good ride.<br /><br />Give it a shot and enjoy it! I recommend popcorn because this film is a lot of fun. Four out of five stars.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Saw it in the theater.  The movie begins in the mountains and deserts of Afghanistan, as a group of Army Hummers are transporting businessman Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) through the war zone. All of a sudden, explosions begin and shots are fired at the Hummers. US Soldiers are shot and killed.  Stark jumps out of the Hummer and starts running. As an idiot could guess, he doesn't get far before he gets shot and captured.<br /><br />Rewind 36 hours to an award ceremony at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, where Tony Stark is about to get an award for his achievements in the weapons' producing industry. His father began Stark Industries some time ago and Tony took over when Daddy died. Tony was a 6-year old product developer so, at probably 40-something, he is quite proficient now. He remains single and enjoys a romp with the ladies, now and then.  While the award is being handed out, Tony is gambling in Vegas and smoozing the women.  His military liaison (Terrence Howard) comes looking for him in the casino to remind him that he promised to be there for the award, so, you can see the carefree attitude of a stuck-on-himself, filty-rich genius.  Gwyneth Paltrow is his administrative assistant who takes care of everything for him. Stark has an awesome car, his own plane, and a computer system that would probably make Bill Gates drool, complete with holographic imaging. (You will likely recognize Terrance Howard when you see him.)<br /><br />Fast forward back to Afghanistan.  Stark was there to conduct a weapons missle presentation for the US army. Stark was seriously injured. He is hauled off to a terrorist camp.  As he looks around, he notices the camp is loaded with Stark weapons. He begins to realize that his lifetime labors of love have also been going to the ""bad"" guys to help them kill Americans.  The terrorists order Stark to build his new missile for them and they will set him free. He knows its a lie but it buys him time to appear to work on the missle. Instead he builds a very special iron man suit.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, with a shaved head, plays an interesting role. I believe he is chairman of the board at Stark Industries, or something similar.  This is a super good action film. Great job by all the actors. Good guys vs. bad guys theme. The computer graphic imaging was great, too. Approximately 2 hrs. Not for young children. (Some people get shot in Afghanistan, and although these scenes were not belabored, I doubt that you want your young impressionable children to carry these images around in their heads.)"
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This is a good movie to own for the Harry Potter collection and to give as a gift to anyone who likes to watch movies.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	We watch the old dvd faithfully most years.  But this year we decided to try the blu ray 3D version of a Polar Express.  I thought the dvd had the most amazing images ever but the 3D just blew our minds.  Amazingly beautiful movie based on a heart warming classic children's book.<br /><br />Please do not confuse this blu ray 3D with the old fashioned cardboard glasses 3D.  This is so beyond that technology! Well worth the price to have this gorgeous movie as part of your classic Christmas traditions.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"HBO has taken the excellent David McCullough non-fiction award winner and adapted it to the screen in a manner that does the book proud.<br /><br />While the book begins with Adam's birth and early life, the HBO series begins with his brilliant, but controversial defense of the British soldiers who took part in the event known as the ""Boston Massacre"".<br /><br />The series does an excellent job of portraying not only Adams brilliance, but his shortcomings as well and his lifelong dependence on Abigail is treated as the unique and beautiful relationship that it actually was.<br /><br />Here is a man (and a woman) who dedicated their entire lives to the founding of the country and the system of government that we enjoy today.  They did this at not only great personal sacrifice, but unfortunately to the sacrifice of their children and others close to them.<br /><br />John Adams was a great man ... Abigail Adams was a great woman.  Together, they had as much or more influence on the early years of our democracy as anyone.  Unfortunately Adam's own prediction that history would say that ""Benjamin Franklin smote the earth with his electrical rod and out popped George Washington and Thomas Jefferson ...."" has proven to be all too accurate until now.<br /><br />I have now read two wonderful books that completely changed my perspective on John Adams' career.  One is ""Setting the World Ablaze"" by John Ferling, the other is ""John Adams"" by David McCullough.<br /><br />This HBO mini-series ... the best screen adaptation of a book I have seen since ""Lonesome Dove"" is simply the icing on the cake!  Enjoy!!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"This is a great flick that grows on one with multiple viewings.  It appeals on several levels:<br /><br />- Technical virtuosity and animation. Hey, it's Pixar.<br /><br />- Characters.  Lightning IS a hotshot youngster in for some learning.  The Sheriff is, well, the Sheriff.  Doc Hudson is - or comes to be - sympathetic.  You root for him and for Lightning at the end.<br /><br />-  Recent history.  How the Interstates eclipsed towns that they passed by.  The romance of old Route 66, ""the Mother Road.""  The hypnotic lure of Western landscapes - as the heroine fleeing from L.A. says, ""I fell in love."" The film is poetry at times.<br /><br />-  A paean to the Hudson Hornet racecar of the early 1950's.  I remember back then that even street Hudsons were low-slung somethings special.<br /><br />-  Just plain fun.  I wish the scene where the cars are boogey-dancing down the street could have gone on and on.  That Sheriff moved so cool.  The two Italians were sweet, too (the tire shop owner is a Fiat 500, by the way, Italy's remarkable postwar little two-cylinder car that went everywhere from the highest Alps to the lowest valleys)."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"Fireproof is a great Christian story about love, redemption, and honoring the bonds of matrimony.  So many times, you hear stories of Christian marriages ruined by lack of trust, pornography, infidelity, money, etc and the characters in this movie are no different.  They are both young, career-oriented people who allow the pressures and stresses of life to get in the way of what should matter most in their lives - God and eachother.  Even as their marriage is rocks and ready to come apart, Calb (Kirk Cameron) rediscovers his faith, with the help of his father, and works to rewin the heart of his wife.  A beautiful love story without turning into the sex-filled dramas that Hollywood churns out.<br /><br />If you like the movie, the Kendricks have also come out with many Fireproof-themed books and guides, including the same <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805448853"">Love Dare</a> book that Cameron's character goes through in the move, to help Christians out there who also struggle to make marriages work amid the ugliness of modern life.

B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is an incredible film. For all those who think this film's storyline is weak or boring...wow. This film's got to be the most realistic out of the five. The bonus features in the Special Edition are what one would expect from a single disc release...The Digital Download is not for iPods, and it cannot be converted into iPod format. Overall, the best thing of the DVD is the film itself. Hopefully the next Harry Potter DVD will be packed with loads more extras...like the first 3 films.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	This is less a movie review and more a defense of it (contains spoilers!). I think people need to get over the fact the movie was advertised as a thriller/horror and think it didn't deliver... was it a horror movie? NO... you found that out... was it really meant to be? NO... Shyamalan's intentions are clear, create an atmosphere to disorient and mislead people until the point he shows you what is really going on. That may not be scary but it is suspenseful and entertaining... Signs and The Sixth Sense weren't really horror movies either... They were also telling dramatic stories with a twist ending.<br /><br /> Think for a moment. How else could the movie be advertised? M. Night Shyamalan's &quot;The Village&quot;. A disturbing tale of modern day people tired of the modern day world... watch as they deceive their offspring into believing they are forever trapped into a solitude of 19th century life trapped in by unspeakable monsters... now... wouldn't that ruin the plot twist... and all the excitement!? It is advertised to disguise this fact because it takes you on a ride with a climatic twist for an ending. It is shallow and shamefully aesthetic to think this movie sucks because what... there aren't really monsters? This movie has something more to convey? I think that mentality conveys the low level of today's movie goer's sense of entertainment... THIS MOVIE PLAYS TO YOUR THOUGHTS, BELIEFS, AND EMOTIONS... a deeper and more satisfying experience. Shyamalan should be praised for avoiding the Hollywood sheep movies that are produced today... he is very refreshing and I THANK HIM!
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	"Let me preface this by saying that I have not liked a Harry Potter movie since Chamber of Secrets, the last one that Chris Columbus directed. Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets truly felt magical, filled with spells, unusual creatures, and wizards' robes. You really felt like you were in fantasy world. Understandably, as the series progresses the tone gets less happy and sparkly, and more ominous and gloomy. I don't think that should mean the magic factor has to be downplayed, or at least keep them in wizard garb. From Prisoner of Azkaban on they all look just like like regular kids at some boarding school in Europe, who just happen to have wands. Most of them shouldn't even know what muggle clothes look like, let alone sport the latest fashions.<br /><br />I did myself a disservice by rereading the book right before seeing the movie. As a total HP geek I of course want the movies to retain all details, but I realize that each movie would have to be about eight hours long for that to be possible. While reading there were many times where I thought, I wonder how they'll translate this info to film, and turns out their answer was to simply cut it. In the book we learn a great deal about Dumbledore's past, his family, and his connection to Grindelwald - the great dark wizard before Voldemort. The movie glosses over these things, mentioning them in passing without explanation. Instead they chose to waste time by drawing out the camping trips and adding in extraneous scenes like an impromptu dance session between Harry and Hermione. They also didn't have the kids using the Invisibility Cloak at all, while in the book they spent practically all their time traveling under that thing. While I can see from a cinematic standpoint that you can't have your main characters invisible for most of the film, it seemed like a strange thing to leave out entirely since the Cloak is actually one of the Deathly Hallows. I was, however, really impressed with the animation of the fable, The Three Brothers. For a moment I was afraid they were just going to have Hermione sit there and read it to us, but the little cartoon was a nice break in the film and was very artistic. It was surprising to me how gory this film was; they showed George's damaged ear and Ron's splinching in all their bloody glory, and even The Three Brothers tale (a children's story) was quite grisly and grim. I guess they didn't rate it PG-13 for nothing.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, I couldn't get over how old the kids looked. It feels weird to even call them ""kids."" Harry has a perpetual five 'o clock shadow, Ron is gargantuan, and Hermione seems to have fallen out of a J. Crew catalog.  All in all, it wasn't a bad movie but it wasn't great either. There were definitely a lot of moments that I enjoyed, but I think too many important details were left out or changed that I can't reasonably give this a good review.<br /><br />[...]"
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I would never have thought of Paul Giamatti as John Adams, but he pulls it off in excellent style!<br /><br />Adams has been one of my favorite founding fathers for a long while. He has been very lucky that many wonderful books have been written about him beside the famous McCullough one. I think of two in particular- Page Smith's two volume set and John Ferling's bio. I also liked the portrayal of him in the movie '1776' by William Daniels.<br /><br />This brings me back to Giamatti. He really made the role his own and got better and better as the series went along. By the time he reached the presidency he WAS John Adams. Giamatti has many great scenes and he really pulls out all the stops. His speech for the Declaration of Independence is grand and there are many wonderful scenes such as meeting King George III and his speech in the church in Episode I. I also like the use of 'Hail Columbia' in Episode 6. That scene alone is worth something in and of itself. Also a note about the wonderful credits that bring the old battle flags back to life. 'Don't tread on me' and 'Appeal to Heaven' are just two great old slogans in the flags. The opening credits are really stirring.<br /><br />Laura Linney pretty much matches Giamatti scene for scene. Abigail is also a favorite historical character of mine. I wrote a paper on Abigail in college and find her truly fascinating. Linney does a really great acting job and brings Abigail back to life. Also, Tom Wilkinson as Ben Franklin and Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson are worthy of high praise. David Morse as George Washington is very good also but I liked the depiction of Washington by Jeff Daniels in 'The Crossing' a little better.<br /><br />I have only a few quibbles: there are some 'dutch angles' that were really not needed. The camerawork should just have been straight forward. Also, some of the historical facts are changed around for some reason. The real history is just as fascinating and should have been left alone. In this regard I think of the famous correspondence between Adams and Jefferson as being depicted as starting in 1818 after the death of Abigail instead of the actual time of 1812. In real life Abigail wrote some letters to Jefferson during this time. There are a few more factual changings but on the whole they don't detract that much from the miniseries. In the end I'm just thankful something like this was even made.<br /><br />Also, the closing scene of the miniseries will stay with you a long time and the wonderful quote by Adams that ends the miniseries really is a great finale.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	I watched it in the theater and bought it again online.  You will like this movie if you're into space horror and scifi this movie is nicely dark.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	I have to admit this movie was not as scary as The Sixth Sense,but it still was a great movie,and I will be buying the DVD.I know there is going to be alot of hard core horror fans that will bich and moan.But I think Hard core fans of M.Night Shyamalan like me will leave the theater very satisfied.What kind of movie will M.Night do next?Cant wait to find out!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Ben Stein is a lot of fun in this and the production is top-notch. There are so many gems to take away from this Documentary you'll need to watch it several times.<br /><br />If you like the notion of FREE SPEECH and CHALLENGING the status quo with honest debate in academia, you'll love the premise of this movie. If you have a pulse this should fire you up. Think of it as a Braveheart without the kilts.<br /><br />If however, evolution is already your religion and embedded into your melon, and abortion on-demand is cool with you (because after all.. we are just animals) this movie will not sway you one bit.. it will simply piss you off. For me, it was fun to watch elitist professors squirm when asked the basics of what they deem as fact. When challenged (like all reptiles) they had a pattern of ridiculing and belittling those who threaten their lively hood. Kudos to the brave men and women who stood up to make this instant classic.<br /><br />Side-note: I own this movie and watch it with my kids.. but I remember seeing this at the movie theater when it first came out at selected showings and the entire audience stood and applauded.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"Have you ever noticed how Kristen Stewart is seemingly only in movies where there are 2 guys always surrounding her (The ""Twilights,"" ""Adventureland,"" ""The Yellow Handkerchief"")?  Here she plays the titled Ms. White, the rightful heir to her father's throne, who is now imprisoned.  Dad was murdered on his wedding night (the mother of Snow died earlier) by the beautiful Ravenna (an evil, juicy Charlize Theron).  Ravenna, it appears makes use of her great beauty by marrying and eliminated various kings.  She pulls this off for many years because of a spell she received that requires her to drain the life from the kingdom's unspoiled young women.  Snow White is too young, so in the cell she goes.<br /><br />There are several episodes of the ""mirror mirror on the wall"" chant but this mirror isn't just an animated glass mirror.  It is gold and becomes molten (think ""Terminator 2"") and forms a humanoid shape.  This version of the Grimm classic is appropriately dark and full of filmmaker wizardry, including a colorful section of mushrooms with eyes, forest creatures and a white stag.  An obvious homage to the Walt Disney original.  While the film waffles back and forth between light and dark it also has a tendency to bog down just when it starts to get good.<br /><br />The battle scenes are PG-13 cool enough and Kristen Stewart is fetching in her battle armor, but the film falls short of ""Game of Thrones"" (numerous unintended comparisons) in style and substance.  After about 8 years of imprisonment the now a young woman, Snow White manages to escape and enters the dark forest ultimately engaging a would-be hunter (Chris Hemsworth) and a childhood friend (Sam Claflin) as fellow combatants in an effort to dethrone the evil queen.  To the filmmaker's credit, Snow doesn't spend any time thinking of romance with either of the hunks longing for her favors.  She's obviously too busy planning the overthrow.  So who's the fairest of them all?  My vote goes to Charlize Theron."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Great film!  Excellent character voices.  A super film for the whole family.

B001KZG99A	4.0	b	Ironman is one of Marvel Comics characters that has been around at least in comic form since the early 1960's.  Something attested to by the fact that I had one conversation about this movie while attending a function at a church related retirement community.  When I heard that this movie was being made, I wondered how the film's producers would take a character who was a munitions maker and a superhero and put him on the big screen.  What if public opinion about the current wars became overwhelmingly negative before the movie's release?  In the comics the line was tread by having Tony Stark become an alchoholic during the heavy military expeditures of the 1980's but this was to be a two hour movie. For this movie, Ironman's origin was altered.  This time Tony Stark is injured by one of his own weapons, an idea borrowed from the comicbook origin of the Incredible Hulk.  The metal suit he develops is intended to be a less lethal method of stopping violent terrorists.  After returning to America he shifts Stark Industries away from the production of weapons.  The antagonist is now a war profiteer in his own company. There is just the right amount of comic relief and although some modifications have been made to the Ironman mythos, the story remains true to the spirit of Marvel Comics.<br />Since this movie is deservedly rated PG-13, a version for younger audiences would nice for parents.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Very different twist to what I am use to. Captivating plot and story that keeps your attention. Gloom and despair is overcome by good.
B00447G29S	2.0	b	For its time, a modest technical achievement  with some fine sequences (the lost ticket, to be specific) but overall the computer generated characters are lifeless, and more than a bit creepy. It misses the mark by a fair bit, and this animated movie highlights why the Pixar animated movies are so successful. Pixar starts with the story and characters and gives them depth and substance, which extends to the animation. This film takes the opposite approach to its own detriment.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Loved this one! My grandchildren watched it every day for a week and still ask to see it when they come over. Very pleased with the service and the dvd
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB4W0W"">True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)</a>I is a great show. wish there was more like it out there"
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I bought this dvd to go with the arguing with myself and jeff dunham is hillarious. A week after I recieved this dvd I got to meet and see jeff in person whe he came to casper for a show.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"I saw this movie not knowing much except it was almost exactly like the comic(camera angles, the character's looks, and the dialogue) and I never read the comics and had no idea they existed until this movie came out. I watched it and I actually enjoyed it for the most part, and I'm a girl. It was really fun to just watch (even if there was no audio)the black and white with certain things colored really worked and looked awesome on the big screen. I really enjoyed Marv's(Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan's(Bruce Willis) stories. They were the most interesting and fun to watch. Unfortunately Dwight's(Clive Owen) story was a real drag(thus why I give this 4 stars instead of 5 and why I say I liked this movie for the most part). I was so bored at that part and was glad it wasn't the last story. That would have been really bad to end the movie with that story. And the prostitutes were annoying too. But if I just ignore that part and focus on the rest of the movie I really really liked it even if it was violent and a ""guy flick""(naked girls). I recommend this movie to adults only and those who don't care about violence, nudity, and swearing. If you are a parent and you let your kid watch this you are one messed up parent! This is totally NOT a kid flick! And it does deserve it's ""R"" rating and 18 years and up warning!"
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"First let me just say that if you've never seen any of the Indiana Jones movies (what are the chances?...slim to none?) that you should see them before you dive into Crystal Skull. Why? Because if Crystal Skull is your first Indy experience, you'll wonder what all the hype was about. Crystal Skull is a fairly good adventure, but it's mediocre at best when compared to its Indy predecessors.<br /><br />In Crystal Skull Indy's on a mission to return a stolen relic to its rightful resting place (familiar, no?). But unlike the first three Indy movies, Steven Spielberg has gone wayyy over the top with the ""yeah right"" moments and the CGI special effects...to the point of distraction! It seemed like almost all of the action was noticeably filmed in front of a green screen....Which wouldn't have been too bad if wasn't so darn noticeable.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong...Crystal Skull was a fun story and I was thoroughly entertained watching. I just found myself rolling my eyes a bit too much in disbelief. So I'd recommend starting with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ONE"">the first three movies</a> before you jump onto the Blu Ray train to the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />It certainly isn't necessary to see the first three movies in the series in order to fully enjoy Crystal Skull. But it will give you some history prior to jumping into a 4th in a series, and it won't be time wasted as they are all excellent films. Here's a little bit on each:<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark was stunning for its time (1981). No surprise with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg at the helm. Raiders holds up as one of the best action movies to date. Indiana Jones searches for and tries to protect a powerful relic from getting into the wrong hands. Viewers get thoroughly entertained with a fast moving, suspenseful and thrilling ride.<br /><br />In Temple of Doom (1984) Indy inadvertently finds himself thrust into village overrun by an evil cult that commit human sacrifice and child slavery. Ironically, while the themes in Temple are much darker than its processor, Spielberg actually 'dumbed it down' a bit (with a good amount of slapstick and other silliness) in order to keep the film attractive to wider audiences and also to attain the first ever PG-13 rating (instead of an R).<br /><br />The Last Crusade (1989) brings in the great Sean Connery as Indy's dad, and together they fulfill a lifelong dream (more the Dad's dream than Indy's) of finding The Holy Grail. Strangely, Last Crusade got hit with a PG-13, but it was much lighter than Temple of Doom, and it went back to a more Lost Ark kind of action film.<br /><br />So my recommendation is get familiar with (or brush up on) the Indiana Jones movies that made Indiana Jones a household name before you venture to the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff is fabulous!  He keeps you laughing throughout the whole movie.  Although this might not be appropriate for younger children due to language, the puppets are great and is a must see for everyone!  I have seen many comedy movies and this is a good one.  Achmed the dead  terrorist is so funny, (one of our favorites along with Walter and Peanut).  Who would have thought jokes on such a  a sensative subject would be so funny....Jeff really pulls it off and does a great job at it.  This dvd gets a five star rating from my whole family, as well as my friends whom I have lent this to.  Keep up the good work and get some more dvds out soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We are looking forward to many more laughs with Jeff Dunham!
B001684L0A	4.0	b	What a wonderful series!<br /><br />Laura Linney gives a magical portrayal of Abigail Adams.  This has to be Ms. Linney's signature performance.  Paul Giamatti is brilliant.  David Morse captures perfectly the stiff and unassuming General Washington.  Steven Dillane gives us a truly idealistic and cerebral Jefferson.<br /><br />The sets, the costumes, the make-up and the script are all first class, and are all superbly brought together under Tom Hooper's direction.<br /><br />I enjoyed this whole series immensely and would recommend it to anyone with even a casual interest in our history, or anyone that simply enjoys a great story told well.<br /><br />Now I will have to read Mr. McCullough's book!
B000H7I6CU	3.0	b	Okay, unless you are an ex-pat or just plain American or you closely follow NASCAR racing, you would find this movie very entertaining.<br /><br />However, I'm none of those. Aren't Disney movies aimed to entertain 90% of the worlds population? Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not an anti-Disney activist but, this movie in my mind definitely did not live up to its media hype.<br /><br />Saw it at the theatre on the first week it was out with my easily amused significant other... hmm alright, I thought. Maybe I'll grow on me. (by the way, no one in the theatre on the opening week of a movie in the middle of New Zealands largest city at 7pm? Thats saying something)<br /><br />Second time I saw it, the kids who watched it with me got up and left during the first 10 minutes.. kids who usually pay attention to movies.<br /><br />Third time I saw it, I thought, whoa. I just don't know whats funny.<br /><br />At first glance it has the elements of a fantastic family movie.. Owen Wilson, a great story line, awesome animation, catchy soundtrack, little off jokes to entertain the older siblings and parents... awesome!!...but the very exclusive, very American NASCAR jokes went way over my head.<br /><br />Although, it is not Disney/Pixar's best feature film, I will give it props for creating Luigi. He is very, very cute.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"Robert Downey Jr. doesn't strike the average viewer as superhero material, which is probably why IRON MAN works so magnificently. Based on the Marvel Comics series about industrialist Tony Stark who builds a metallic suit chock full of high-tech gadgetry and dedicates his life to saving the world, IRON MAN is a witty and intelligent action film.<br /><br />Downey is near perfect playing the multibillionaire Stark. One minute he is the Playboy of The Western World a la James Bond. The next minute he rivals Al Pacino's Tony Montana of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AMRJC"">Scarface</a> for crassness. He is a workaholic, a hedonist, and an eccentric loner, whose only close relationship is with his secretary, Pepper Potts, played here by Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />Beautiful yes, but more so translucently lovely, Ms. Paltrow has an inborn grace that softly overwhelms the viewer. To date, this reviewer has seen that quality of elegance onscreen only in actress Natalie Portman and in Ms. Paltrow's own mother, Blythe Danner. Paltrow's competent but feminine Pepper therefore, is the perfect counterpoint to Downey's brash Iron Man.<br /><br />In this version, Stark is wounded by terrorists. Escaping, he takes on the Iron Man persona and returns to wreak vengeance. Unfortunately, the terrorists are being aided by a business rival of Stark Industries, who builds a similar suit and engages Iron Man in a battle for New York City.<br /><br />This movie is definitely a cut above most Superhero films, a real Summer Movie. Marvel is constantly perfecting their cinematic craft."
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	I really loved this movie until the big fight at the end.  Robert Downey Jr. is one of the better actors and he was perfect fit for this movie.  This is a clear definition of summer blockbuster.  Great special effects and great acting from all the stars. Only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that I wasn't really impressed with the fight with Ironman and the bad guy.  I was expecting little bit more from the last fight.  Other than that really good movie.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	If you liked Robocop, you definitely love IRONMAN.<br /><br />But at the same time, this movie tells the story of a few things that are true and going as we breathe.<br /><br />One thing that p***** me off is that we have terrorists in our own country under our noses and they are being covered up.  They are probably committing illegal acts right now.....Just think about how Jeff Bridges betrayed Morton Junior.<br /><br />Also, this movie proves to me that the government(certain politicians and leaders) is good at only one thing.....covering up lies, cheating, killing, stealing, and manipulating.<br /><br />But if you have a closed mind and is naive, you will only see and hear what you want.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	i dont agree with people who said the movie was bad and boring, a good movie doesnt have to be filled with action in order to be interesting. it was a really great movie with a nice morale, and it is very unpredictible but its not ridiculous, its a movie that makes u think about the society and everything. when i went to the movies i thought it was just a simple horror movie  but its so much deeper than that.the acting was really good, joaquin phoenix and bryce dallas howard were really impressive and so was adrien brody as the mentally retarded noah. in my opinion the village was the best movie of 2004 along with million dollar baby
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I loved it and I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind...i can not get enough of this movie...
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"Well it's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Last Crusade, but Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is still better then The Temple of Doom and will stand proud with its predecessors as a solid action flick living up to an American icon. This long awaited final chapter to the story of treasure hunter Harry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. may not live up to the greatness which were the first and third entries, but don't let a simple comparison ruin the fun of this fourth movie; on its own merits it still stands well enough on its own two feet, even if it isn't a masterpiece.<br /><br />The film starts off with a convoy of troops driving down a large road in Nevada while a gang of kids trail behind. The convoy pulls into a military base which is closed for a military test, but little do the guards know that these are actually Soviet KGB agents come to steal the treasures of some old military warehouse, the same one we saw the Ark go into at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indi is in the trunk of the car. Oh no, what kind of trouble has our hero gotten himself into this time? On the hanger doors of the building a large 51 is painted in black letters. Surly this couldn't be the infamous area 51. Or could it?<br /><br />Okay, I'll stop right there so not to give away too much of the films premise, but as I said in the title this is a VERY different movie then the kind we're used to seeing for Indiana Jones. Gone are the Nazis and biblical artifacts, here come the Russians and the cold war. One of the things I found very entertaining about this film was the harkening back to the 50's, the cold war red scares, the double agents, the talks of aliens and such, very much like the old films from that time. It really brings to light that this is a different time period then the previous films, this is the beginning of the cold war, and darn it we're going to have some cold war fun. From jet engines, to demonstrators marching down the street with signs saying ""better dead then red,"" this movie really pokes fun at all the scares and worries of that time period. We even get to see the detonation of an atomic bomb in one hilarious sequence of events which involve Indiana climbing into a refrigerator. I'm telling you that is one of the greatest scenes in any Indi film ever.<br /><br />Now I know what's on everyone's minds, you want to know if Harrison Ford can still pull off his old jump around and whip people routine. Well I'll let you know that, no, there isn't as much action in this film as there is in some of the older ones but what action did make its way into this film is quality stuff. No worries here my friend, Ford is still as good as he was in his prime. Fortunately Ford doesn't have to do all the work in this film, he has some help from Mutt, a new character who ------------ oh, sorry about that, I forgot, you all don't like spoilers. Okay, fine.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure they wrote his part into the film not because it would make it more interesting (although it does) or that it would deepen the plot (but it still does), I have the sneaky suspicion that he was put in to take the strain off of Fords back. Well no problem because Shia LaBeouf can pull off the action hero pretty well. I've never liked him very much, but here his performance was right on Q, giving us a LOT of comic relief and a healthy dose of action. Oh yeah, the action; well its solid. Three words for you buddy, REALLY BIG ANTS!!! Remember the scene in Raiders where that Nazi got chopped up in the airplane blades? Well this scene is a combination of that and that one scene in the first Mummy movie where the guy got eaten by bugs, only it's a Soviet getting killed and their in the Amazon, not Egypt. From Ford jumping back and forth on moving cars, to LaBeouf showing off his best Tarzan impersonation, the action leaves little to be desired.<br /><br />So how about negatives? Well, as I said, it's strange, maybe a little too strange for its own good. Why not stick to what we know? I hear Lucas wanted to do something even stranger then this but Spielberg and Ford had to talked him out of it, and at this point I'm really glad they did because there is no telling what he would have done had no one gad been there to knock some sense into him. Maybe that's why his new Star Wars movies were so bad. I know it's an Indiana Jones movie and I have to suspend my belief if I'm going to enjoy it, but please, don't push it. There are also a few inconsistencies in the plot, some characters who are less then believable, and maybe one too many ""look at this really cool special effect"" type shots, but I'll leave that judgment up to you.<br /><br />So for all you die hard fans wondering if this new entry will live up to expectations, just go in expecting something slightly better then Temple of Doom but maybe not as good as the two other films and you'll be alright. For everyone else, just sit back and enjoy. This is, after all, an Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />Replay value; High."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Awesome.  Much more material than what was seen on Comedy Central's program.  I could watch him for hours.  Best there is since Ronn Lucas.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I love all the Marvel Comics superheroes, but none more than Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. gives an impressive performance (along with the rest of the cast) and the effects are eye-popping. Awesome movie.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Excellent series which gives an enlightening insight into the pre and post- revolutionary war period. The two leads, Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney , won Golden Globes for their portrayals of John and Abigail Adams.<br />A must-see for anyone remotely interested in our American heritage!
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Now I'm not a huge Marvel comics fan, but i have to say. Having read some of the Iron Man comics, this movie is spot on. Robert Downey Jr. does an awsome job as Tony Stark, the good thing is , that this movie isn't afraid to be a comic book movie. From watching Stark build his suit in the cave, to all the interactions with the other characters. This is a fun movie
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is a great Workout and recommend to anyone who is willing. This is a great deal. Prices are great and it is very very very trustworthy . Hope it is great for everyone else
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Best telling of a fairytale I've seen, although anyone else for Snow White would have been choice. Anyone. But honestly Kristen redeemed herself a little in this movie. Unfortunately, she happened to be cast alongside two of the most talented actors in the game.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth became an instant favorite of mine after seeing him in Thor, and he was no let down as The Huntsman in this dirty, dark, and awesome take on the classic tale. He made the character funny, in a sad kind of way, and his performance was impeccable throughout. (The monolouge he said while speaking to the dead Snow White had me in tears!) Not to mention his crazy accent skills!<br /><br />But overall Theron was the real show stopper. I've heard recently that some people are saying she over acted her role as Queen Ravenna, and I honestly couldn't disagree more. Her wide, glossy eyes and shrill, demanding screams were chilling to say the least. I think she really grabbed onto the concept of the Queen being tormented yet wicked, playing the role well and making her look like the psycho she was supposed to be!<br /><br />Highly recommend this to all ages above 13 and anyone who is into midevail period films and dark, subtly touching movies.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	I do not rate this one as highly as Raiders but certainly better than Temple of Doom and Last Crusade. The storyline was great, even if a few plot devices were less than believable (a defect with all the movies) but for sheer entertainment you'd be hard-pressed to beat Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull. I wish the movie had made the Soviets more obviously evil, perhaps making the male colonel out to be an ex-labor camp chief or something. One of the things that made you root for Indy in the original movies was just how BAD the protagonists were. But still, an excellent film and one I look forward to watching many, many times!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	The tittle says it all. It was just a great action movie without 250 million dollar special effects. I have never seen a Robert Downey Jr. movie, in fact I never really heard of him but he is just awesome in this movie. Terrance Howard was great ad Jim Rhodes (War Machine). Now Im not riding on Marvel or  anything, I just hate it when people have stupid reasons to hate this movie. Some idiot actually said that this movie is racist towards black people. Now how stupid is that?
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	the movie was excellent.<br />no doubt about it. great to see robert downey, jr-back in the game.<br />he is a great actor.<br />great action,great comedy,i was pleasantly surprised with how they pulled iron man off. looks very real.<br />only complaint-i was hoping for better sound quality once the DVD was released. seems while mixing the CD,they cheated us on good sound for the rear speakers.<br />still overall a great DVD to own.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Inorance is not bliss when it comes to the healthcare crisis going on in this country due to the food people eat and how it is produced in our country. Producers of our food count on the American people to remain ignorant due to lack of interest, laziness or simply choosing to turn a blind eye to this subject. Their time is limited though because people are getting tired of watching people they love die of disease and are beginning to search for answers. This movie has many of the answers contained within the information provided. It is the raw truth. It is hard to watch at times. It is even harder to comprehend that food producers, politicians, and our government whom we believe are taking care of our best interest are not doing so but instead serving their own interest - mainly for profit at the expense of health, our lives and the welfare of our country. Every person needs to watch this film - you will never be able to look at food in a grocery store quite the same way again and you will always make conscious decisions on what you choose to eat and spend your money on. I am buying a copy for every member of my family and for my closest friends.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	We love this movie!  Our 3 yr old watches it every day and is crazy about it!!!!  If you have a boy, he'll love it!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I think they did an excellent job in this one - creating the background and characters in a reasonable and understandable way, plus some great actions shots. I was impressed.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	We saw this movie when it first came out.  I have to rate it a five-star because of the entertainment value, especially.  After reading the previous reviews, which made me think if a movie is clean, lacks constant swearing, lacks blood and guts, then it is of less value.  The reason I like Indiana Jones movies is because they lack all of that bad stuff that really decreases the value of a movie in the long-run.  This movie made a fine continuation of the previous stories, and I found it to be something I would enjoy watching over and over again. I thought the special effects were great.  Cate Blanchard added a new dimension to Jone's nemesis-style enemies.  Karen Allen came across as her usual character, though better.  She matured this character well through this movie.  This one proves you can have a thoroughly entertaining movie without all of the tiresome, aforementioned junk that permeates most movies nowadays.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"My wife and I were initially hesitant to watch True Blood.  Though I grew up loving Bella Lugosi movies, we are a little too old to get into the teenage ""vampire hysteria"" that seems to be dominating current entertainment. But after hearing many friends sing the praises of the show we started watching on DVD - and now we are hooked.<br /><br />True Blood isn't just a vampire story - it combines all kinds of genres; horror, romance, mystery, thriller, and starting in season two you even get a heavy dose of their own take on Greek mythology.  The show gradually tranforms the world into a netherland where vampires, psychics, shapeshifters, and various other creatures of the night - both good and bad - coexist together.  From the title sequence that opens the show it is constantly compelling, original, very sexy, and totally unique.  Definately one of the best shows ever to appear on television."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"Fireproof is a must see for anyone desiring to be in a relationship or just to understand better how a truly strong relationship can foundationally work. I saw many examples of attitudes and tendencies that resulted in troubled or ended relationships. The movie went fairly deep yet  brings you higher than imaginable. ""Anything is Possible...""<br /><br />Sherwood Pictures other great movies include, ""Facing The Giants"", ""Flywheel"" and their newest box office hit, ""Courageous""."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I began eating a little better a few weeks before my knee replacement, lost 12 to 15 lbs. Had a bad reaction to anesthesia and/or pain meds, so I didn't eat for 5 days. The 2nd day home I watched this movie, it made such an impact, I've eaten meat only once since and have dropped another 45 lbs. I FEEL GREAT! I offer this movie to anyone that will watch it, so far all have come away with changed diets, if not lives. The movie doesn't try to convince you to eat a particular way, it just presents the information in such a way that you are at your own will to come to your own conclusion. For me I equate eating commercially processed meat to having to survive on bugs, grubs, and roaches. I've completely sworn off hamburger meat and chicken, unless it's free range. Now it's a game my wife and I play in the grocery store spotting the corn by products in almost all processed foods. It's actually harder finding the ones that don't have any. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to everyone and especially those with health and weight problems.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	I will start off by saying that I was disappointed in this film when I first saw it in the theater. Although I was still bothered by a lot of the same things - the sets, that awful snake - I found that I enjoyed the movie much more the second time around, watching it a home. It was a high standard to match after such a long time had passed. There is everything that I loved about the previous Indiana Jones films. Some fans may be bothered by the passing of the hat - figuratively, thank goodness and others may find the science fiction nature of the plot to be a bit off kilter. Still and all, its a fun ride if you just let yourself go and enjoy it. The Blu Ray version has a stunning picture and sound, no complaints there.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	Great film, good dialogues, good action sequences, surreal effort and all. But it's definitely not as good as vast majority paints. Why? Well, apart from lacking extremity in morality or the lack of it, the film doesn't really exclaim loud enough. No tears in the film. The villain deserves an oscar to be fair.

B001KEGR8Y	1.0	b	I saw Jeff Dunham on tv a few years ago and he was so funny. I found this dvd and decided to buy it to show my family. I was disappointed to find out that it was full of profanity. NOT a family program. I didn't realize that it was for adults. Just thought I would warn others. I checked the rating before I bought it and it is not rated. I think they should rate it so people know there is a lot of language.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	We think that this movie was exciting, it has realy cool computors stuff. The suit that he started out with was pretty cool at first but when he came up with the new suit, it really was hi-tec and cooler than cool. the excitment in this movie was way better then part two. That's my opinion anyways, so buy it and check it out for yourself.  Michael
B0006989TE	1.0	b	...this movie sucks. If you can tolerate the dialogue, which is some completely exaggerated form of old-style, colonial-era English, you will find numerous plot holes and a complete lack of imagination. This movie is a real waste of time and money, although I imagine no M. Night Shyamalan fan will believe negative reviews until they see the movie themselves. This seems like the type of plot that a pot-smoking friend would come up with late at night, not the work of the genius-creator of &quot;The Sixth Sense.&quot; My guess is that M. Night will recover from this with his next film, but not before he endures a lot of negative press.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"I could not believe how down right fun this movie is.  The added benefit was seeing it in the El Capitan in Hollywood.  With the organ grinding away as you enter, then, getting to see a pit crew in action and then some kids getting up on stage, wow, then the movie.<br /><br />The review of the movie tells a lot of the plot, but the sond ""Finding Yourself"" really reveals the story.  When I see this movie, I think of the genius behind it.  Some say that hope is lost in America, well, this movie is one of hope, one of coming of age, one of learning to consider where you are headed in life.<br /><br />What got me the most was the spontaneous applause at the end of the movie, the whole audience just suddenly errupted with applause, I have not experienced such a joyful reaction from an audience in a long time.  Not that it is a cartoon, it sends a message, one of friendship and one of turning your life around from selfishness to learning to be a friend.<br /><br />The message to me is that it may only take one person to turn around the lives of many.  The animation is just outstanding, the sound track, wow, what great songs.  I think this may be one of Pixar's greatest movies.<br /><br />""Find yourself"" seeing cars."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	My son has had this video for over a year and still loves to watch it! Fun for adults too. Highly recommend!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Harry Potter is by far the BEST series in both books and in movies.  We have been anxiously awaiting the release of the latest movie to DVD. Having seen the latest part 1 four times at theaters, we cannot wait to watch it at home.  With all of the limted choices offered to young people today, this series has captivated my childrens' hearts and minds for so many years.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	the end of it did much to spoil the the matter. The special effects were brilliant and Harrison Ford did well for a man of his...er stage. Shia LaBoeuf brought a bit of spice to some of the stunts and Cate Blanchett was smashing. The end aside it would have been so much better.
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	While I liked this movie, I can say that even it`s greate, the Blue Ray lacks a lot of options. For example, it has no spanish audio or subtitles. The menu doesen't help much if you want to find something fast and the options are not intuitive.<br /><br />Me gusta mucho la pel&iacute;cula, y aunque es muy buena, para ser un blue ray es bastante pobre. Hay poco material adicional, no tiene audio en espa&ntilde;ol o subt&iacute;tulos. El men&uacute; es complicado y no te ayuda  a encontrar las cosas. M&aacute;s que eso, no es intuitivo.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	A decent super hero flick--it is easy to watch with very enjoyable graphics and a plot that is simple and also easy to follow.  Quite entertaining.  Pat73
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	I love the work out, I haven't been through all the DVD's yet. One of the DVD's does seem to be scratched though, I continuously stops and waits a minute before restarting.  This is very annoying, but I do love the workout. It kicks my butt every time.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This is one great movie.  We love it and watch it over and over.  We had no problems with shipment, packaging or arriving on time.  Thanks
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Obviously a different kind of Snow White story.  Geared more for adults and teens, rather than young children.  Beautiful special effects, with some twist from the original story.  Well worth two hours of your life. Keeping this short, (I hate long boring reviews. Do people really think we read those things!!!) it was a movie worth seeing.
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	A disapointment.  Not without some merit, but not close to the Ridley Scott's greatest works.  No Blade Runner, or even Alien, here.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"Like everyone else on Earth, I was highly anticipating another Indiana Jones movie.  Boy, what a disappointment!  Again, they brought together the dream-team of Lucas, Spielburg, and Ford but it does not work this time around, on any level.  Boring story line, mediocre acting, and a running time that leaves you restless and tired.  This film felt very ""forced"", like they made just for the sake of making it. Rent it if you must, but I don't recommend buying it, ever."
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"Apparently it wasn't enough to stupify Star Wars. LucasArts had to resurrect Indiana Jones and ruin him too. This movie is TERRIBLE!<br /><br />The old mysticism, historical intrigue, intelligent humor and charming characterization is completely absent from this stinking rehash. There is only a pablum mixture of trite, childish dialogue, overused and outdated cliches, lousy acting, and a plot that seems to blend the most banal elements of ""Da Vinci Code"" with ""The X-Files."" I am angry that I had to pay for this with actual money. Enough said?<br /><br />Addendum: In fairness, the actors did their best with awful lines. And Ford has such screen presence, it's always a pleasure to see him in action. I just hope his next project has more substance."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This was a fabulous movie.  If you like the Comic book genre, this is one of the best out there.  Tony Stark was an awesome character.  Robert Downey Junior delivered the character incredibly.  I would definitely see it repeatedly, loved it.<br />But, it really is a shame if you missed the opportunity to see it on the big screen.  It is a great movie theater film.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This was a wonderful series created by HBO, Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney did a wonderful job as John and Abigail Adams! Also the music score was fantastic! I do hope the writer and director of this series does a sequel, perhaps about John Quincey Adams?
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I'm not a follower of comic books so found the Special Features section very informative and entertaining, adding to the enjoyment of this fine movie.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	Well done production.<br />  Slow moving and yet sometimes the thematic elements are difficult to grasp.<br />  The casting is excellent. However, if you're a Tommy Lee Jones fan, be careful. He's totally subdued within his character with limited screen time.<br />  Chilling and captivating as the storyline progresses.<br />  Confusing and irritating in its denouement.<br />  Did it deserve the Oscar for Best Picture?<br />  Strictly...a matter of opinion.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	We couldn't believe the price on Amazon for this series!  Amazing!  We saw it on borrowed VHS tapes when it came out years ago and can't wait to watch it again.  If you love history, this is a must for your library!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5LEXS"">Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself</a><br />This guy should be a household name.  Funny, funny, funny."
B001684L0A	4.0	b	This is a first class movie in its own right.  I did not give it 5 stars only because nothing is perfect.  There seems to have been a lot of emphasis on historical accuracy, that and the cinematography transports you back to 1776.  The acting is wonderful as the characters seem three dimensional.  This is not for the pre-teen folks as the cruelty of life is not whitewashed. Every citizen should watch this! (Also loved the pop up history facts.)
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I remember seeing Jeff Dunham on the Johnny Carson show years ago, and yet he doesn't look like he has aged a day.<br /><br />I have watched my DVD of Arguing With Myself 5 times.  Even though I know the punchline coming up, I still laugh till tears flow!  Jeff and his ""friends"" are absolutely amazing, to the point where you would think those puppets had come to life.<br /><br />You will enjoy this over and over again!  It's the best $10 I've ever spent!"
B000S5KGH4	2.0	b	I have seen Jeff many times on television and have truly enjoyed the clean version of his show.  I started watching this show with my family and was appalled at the number of sexual comments and innuendos.  This was not at all what I expected and I am greatly disappointed.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	"I don't know why, but ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth installment of Harry Potter films is by far the shortest of the series. Considering the numbers of the characters and the events that happen to them, the film's 138 minutes is too short. It needs three hours and the content deserves that length.<br /><br />Plot thickens here. No more delightful Quidditch can be seen. In spite of the occasional comical moments and Harry's romance, the film's tone gets darker than ever and even Ron's mother looks more worried. If you remember what happened at the end of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" she should be more worried about her children. That means some scenes might be too scary for kids.<br /><br />New characters (and talent) enter the story - newcomer Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is most impressive - and some regular characters like Draco Malfoy are almost forgotten. I don't know how many of you miss Draco, but with additional 20 or 30 minutes this kind of thing could be avoided. Helena Bonham Carter's villainous Bellatrix Lestrange is introduced a bit too abruptly in the story, which lessens the impact of the final battle scene and its consequences.<br /><br />The visuals themselves are fantastic as always, but director David Yates is no Alfonso Cuaron. The special effects such as Harry and friends flying over Themes River are, technically, just wizardly, but not imaginative. The scenes are beautiful, but no wicked humor of Shrunken Head. But it all depends on your taste. I just prefer different approach and that's all.<br /><br />The film should be longer by at least 20 minutes, but I believe there is a director's cut somewhere in Warner's studio. Until we see it, sorry, but three stars."
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	I am disappointed in True Blood.  I loved the Sookie Stackhouse books.  I will finish watching the series because I bought it.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"I saw Iron Man. I loved it.<br /><br />Tony Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr., owns a weapons manufacturer. On a trip to demonstrate a new missile, the Jericho, which knocks out a wall of defenses with many small bombs deployed from a single shot, he is captured. His captors are essentially killers Al-Qaeda. They want him to build this device.<br /><br />In a cave, he realizes he cannot escape on his own. He'll build the bomb, and then, they'll kill him. Bad deal. He secretly builds the Iron Man suit and gets back home. Fellow captive and engineering genius Dr. Yinsen cautions him, ""Don't waste your life."" Yinsen gives his life to save Tony's.<br /><br />While in captivity, he sees that his weapons are used by the enemy. Why? How?<br /><br />He had been a sleazy, rich, indulgent womanizer. Now, he sees the light. Not only is he a new man with his morals, but, with his view about weapons. His Iron Man suit will be used for good, by him. Specifically, he will use it to take down the enemy's stock of Stark Industry weapons.<br /><br />One problem. His partner, Obadiah Stane, is in cahoots with the enemy. He sanctioned Stark's capture, and is the one selling Stark products. He double crosses the enemy, and acquires the Iron Man prototype suit and plans.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), previously seen as a plain assistant, starts looking good to Tony Starks. Both realize they are nowhere without the other.<br /><br />What now?<br /><br />Go see it. Surprise ending.<br /><br />When you do, look for Stan Lee. He's the Hugh Hefner lookalike.<br /><br />The acting is solid, with Downey spot-on for the role. Paltrow is replaceable. Jeff Bridges, as Obadiah, is excellently cast. Shaun Toub as Dr. Yinsen carries the role impressively, though we only see him in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Terrence Howard as Lt. Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes is the weakest link, as he comes across too feminine and insipid to be the kind of leader he should be as the liaison between Stark Industries and the military.<br /><br />The movie's messages: heroes are men who do the right thing even if it means sacrifice, and, bigger guns do not necessarily lead to peace. The message is conflicted, however, as it is bigger guns which save the day (with some good ol' experience thrown in).<br /><br />The idea of not wasting one's life -- having purpose and vision -- comes through well. This brings the movie from sheer pulp to something with depth. Tony Stark is not perfect; some of his faults are indefensible. He is, though, a man on a mission. That's a pretty good idea for all of us.<br /><br />Violent at times, horrific at others -- the terrorists here are put in their proper light, but as they murder, it is very realistic and frightening.<br /><br />Sensuality -- Tony Starks is a womanizer, and we see evidence of this, especially as he seduces an equally arrogant Brown University graduate and magazine writer Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb). When Pepper Potts is escorting her out, she refers to her as trash.<br /><br />Would I bring kids? Probably not. PG-13 it is rightly rated.<br /><br />Look for a sequel. I fully recommend ""Iron Man.""<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />http://anthonytrendl.blogspot.com"
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	First of all this Collector's Edition of No Country For Old Men is NOT a 3 disc set as the advertising reads. There are only two and if you buy a used copy the digital disc won't work because the original customer used the code. I'm trying to get Lions Gate to give me a new code but I haven't heard from them yet. There are several things in the way this product is described that isn't true or confusing at best. It advertises over FIVE HOURS of special features. IF there is, it must be on the digital disc because it isn't on the blu-ray and there isn't a third disc. You might want to wait to see if Amazon will clean up the descriptions of the different versions of the movie.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	The Polar Express rates with the other classics of Christmas time, including Miracle on 34th Street, It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol, and many others.<br /><br />This is a movie that has all the magic of Christmas. It is a pity that it was released the same time as The Incredibles, so got overlooked by many. This story has several who need to learn a lesson, like the one who is losing all faith in Christmas, and is becoming cynical about other things. He is taken on the way by the Conductor, the mysterious Hobo and his companions. With it, a kid who has been left out of the magic, a know-it-all and others like them are given exactly what they need.<br /><br />I wish I had seen it on IMAX. The depth of the animation is incredible. The only weak part of the movie was that dance with the waiters, which I agree should have been left on the cutting room floor, as it distracted from the main theme.<br /><br />But, the DVD is worth waiting for. I'm putting it on my Christmas list. Don't ever lose the magic!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	From the first episode I was enchanted. Every other Vampire Movie/Series has been either a bad B-Movie or just lame graphics/story line. UNTIL Ture Blood. The most engaging, captivating strangly Hypnotic series. EVERY character adds there own flavor to the show and if you have seen the series or not. This collection far exceded my expectations.Season 2 promises a whole new perspective on these engaging characters. I just recieved Season 1 on Friday and watched every Episode. Before I knew it the Sun was coming up and it was time to retreat to my coffin. NOW THE BEST PART OF THE SEASON ONE DVD'S- Pay attention while watching, you will be surprised at the small additions these episodes have been splashed with. Things HBO left out. What a gift,for all of us. Props to the DVD Editors. What a great treat that was. This was mean't to be a gift. Looks like my friend is geting Perfume instead. I'm keeping this for myself. BRING ON SEASON 2. AVL Forever.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I absolutely believe greed has overtaken corporate giants(Monsanto) to sell their souls and their family's legacy to hell.

B001684L0A	5.0	b	We have already watched this excellent series and liked it enough to add to our permanent collection.  The fine acting, the beautiful and authentic production values and the fascinating history make this a keeper to share and enjoy again and again.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I have read a number of the books this series is based on and I have to say HBO has nailed this one. The cast is great, the production values high and the writing solid. The openning credits are great too. The series differs in some ways from the books, but I like that as it makes it more interesting and in some cases has improved the story line and some characters. Buy the series set. and read the books, it's all good fun.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Want to know why the United States is in such dire shape? People no longer know how to think critically. Bush is one of these people. No science, no future.
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	*** This was copied from a review by LamCui@hotmail.com, with which i agree 100%.<br /><br />*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Ever since I have seen Infernal Affairs (IA), I said to myself that Hollywood would not pass up on a story like this. And true enough, I heard Brad Pitt bought the rights to the show and that he and Tom Cruise are slated to act in it. When I heard that the whole ensemble changed, I still was looking forward to the film. IA, with a much smaller budget, looks more expensive than The Departed (TD).<br /><br />Character development -IA, is all about heart. It is about how the mole in the police, Ming, is torn between his identity as a mole, and his conscience, and the mole in the mafia/gangland, Yan, is torn between doing right for the police and his own dilemma about his identity. Ming is not bad, nor is Yan good. TD, like all other Hollywood cop movies, is about black and white. Costigan is wholesomely good, and Sullivan is utterly bad. Their characters are so one-dimensional, it's almost like the screenwriter doesn't trust his audience to be intelligent enough to know that good and evil are degrees of grey.<br /><br />Timeframe - The time frame is just ridiculous in TD. Are we expected to believe that in the short span of 4 months, Costigan is able to infiltrate the mafia and become Costello's left hand man, given that everyone (so 'cleverly' explained by Queenan) knows that he was a cop and that Costello doesn't trust people easily? Are we also to believe that Sullivan can rise through the ranks of the police force so fast, considering that (also 'cleverly' explained by Ellerby) they don't trust people with perfect records? In IA, it is a convincing many years. Both characters are allowed to grow into their environment enough to be torn. TD just throws it in our face.<br /><br />Acting - How can people say that the acting is superb? Matt Damon doesn't emote at all. Leo Dicarprio is so whiny, if he isn't whining to Queenan, he is whining to the shrink, or Costello and Mr. French. Martin Sheen is like a vase, so weak and wimpy, he doesn't have the air befitting of a Captain. Mark Wahlberg's character, sarcastic as hell, for what? It's a wonder that he is even there, he has no role to play at all. An omission of his character wouldn't have made the movie any less. The shrink sleeps with both Costigan and Sullivan, and we are expected to feel sorry for her? And Jack Nicholson, so painful to watch. Even the extras are so miscast-ed. The Mainland Chinese characters are so obviously 3rd generation Cantonese speakers, with the American accents, I am not a native Cantonese speaker and even I know it's all wrong.<br /><br />Screenplay - This has to be one of the worst screenplays ever.<br /><br />a. Costello, if he is a big time gangland boss, and that he is dealing with international crime lords, why is he and his right hand man still going round the hood to collect protection money? The writers cannot decide if he is a big-time crime lord or a smalltime mafia boss.<br /><br />b. the time-line.<br /><br />c. Costigan sends the tape to Madolyn, gets Sullivan to meet him at the building Queenan died, and expects to do what? It is just a cheap shot at trying to mirror IA's intelligent rooftop scene.<br /><br />d. The fact that the cast says F*** every other second makes the movie cheap and crude instead of realistic.<br /><br />e. the subplots are so unnecessary and so poorly intertwined. The double crossing of the mainland Chinese, the FBI informer subplot, the letter that was never heard of again, the love triangle between moles & shrink, the time in cadet school. All these subplots should be omitted, then maybe the director can concentrate on the real story.<br /><br />f. What's up with the ending? First Costigan is shot (Which is a ripped off from the original), and then everyone else gets shot in the head except Sullivan. Is there a need for all that gore? Or is it just cheap thrill? And then Dignam kills Sullivan. Does Dignam have a great enough agenda to do what he did?<br /><br />g. Did I mention that a lot of scenes of the movie are ripped off from the original? Even the dialog of some of the scenes is directly translated from the original. I read that the writer claims that he didn't see the original. Is he trying to claim the great parts of the movies as his own? Isn't that plagiarism? Which brings me to<br /><br />Production value - Scorsese bombed, big time. He has ran out of tricks, the movie started out good, but the ending seemed so rushed, like he has ran out of time, or interest. I love GoodFellas, and his style and techniques at that time seem fresh and ingenious. But the second time he used the pinhole effect in TD, I realize that Scorsese has ran out of ideas. There are even scenes that he took from the original shot by shot, making it seem like he cannot make his own out of the material.<br /><br />Over all I am very MAD. MAD at the people who say this movie is brilliant. It is brilliant only because the original is brilliant and they had taken almost every element of it. I am MAD because of the disregard of respect on the part of Scorsese's team, not giving the credits when credits are due. Is he going to get an academy award for something that is not his? Something that he so blatantly took from someone else and did not even bother to credit? That would say a lot about Hollywood and their disregard for anyone else. I am MAD at the way the movie ended and I am just disappointed that the audiences are treated like idiots and they don't know it.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	It is a very funny video (better than his first video), especially the terrorist puppet.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	My wife and I watched this movie one night as a secondary pick. It turned out to be a very good movie. We would recommend it.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This is the last Potter movie for my granddaughter.  Now she has the whole collection, plus I am buying the books for her too.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	To those of you who put three are you deaf & blind the movie I watched was the best movie I've seen in ten years better then aviatar
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"I can't say enough good about this movie, with everything going on in the world these days is great to have this ""feel good"" movie to loose yourself in."
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	I just got done watching Prometheus and I was blown away!! I don't know why so many people who have seen this have such a problem with it. I thought it was in the top ten of the very best Science fiction movies I have ever seen! The affects were AMAZING and it actually made you think instead of just being a mindless horror movie. My family and I were on the edge of our seats and were thoroughly entertained!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"If you care that the ""established"" scientific community is methodically promoting a lie at the expense of freedom of speech and freedom of expression, then you need to see Expelled, and read the book The Slaughter of the Dissidents. Ben Steen nails the facts in this very thought provoking documentary."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I think that this DVD is a MUST SEE. There is so much that corporate America doesn't want you to know. So many of our chronic illnesses are preventable!!
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	This is a great film that everyone should watch particularly Americans. I am hoping that they may bring out an Australian version of how we are also being ruled by massive companies and the contiunal over consumption
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and QT (his 2 cents worth) have made a stunningly singular film that makes for a quite a memorable moviegoing experience.  While it may be too violent for the soccer moms of our world and not politically correct for the more anal among us...who cares??? It's a free country and if you don't condone violent movies, then simply don't go - period.  Jamie King is drop dead gorgeous, as is Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy.<br /><br />Benecio Del Toro proves to be the best among the male cast as the mercurial Jackie Boy, although Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, and Bruce Willis (and surprisingly Elijah Wood) more than hold their own as well.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Great movie.  Special features are cool.  The Blu-Ray makes it all that much better.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I have always been a fan of Vampire books and movies.  When the whole Twilight craze came I was reluctant to even read the books let alone watch the movie.  Upon high praise and reccomendation from a friend I caved bought the books bought the movie and my suspicion was confirmed, . .I hated both the movie and books.  When I saw this at Target my first thought was oh great more bad vampire movies and books.  I decided to watch it anyway it was after all HBO and I tend to love HBO series (Elizabeth, Sex and the City, John Adams) they seem to be done so well.  Well, the first episode got me right away.  I loved it.  THIS is what a good vampire show is made of.  The characters are so interesting.  The way new characters are introduced is flawless.  This is the type of series where you sit in complete anticipation of what is going to happen next.  The new season just can't come fast enough.  I can't reccomend this enough but this comes with a full disclosure, . .in true HBO fashion this is not for the meek.  It is bloody and borderlines a NC-17 rating.  There is a lot of sex and foul language to boot but heck what is a good vampire show without sex?  If you are a fan of horror and mystery you just have to see this.  I've started reading the book and I'm enjoying them as much as the series.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	There is nothing better during the Christmas Season, than snuggling with the grandchildren to watch this captivating movie!  The animation portrayed and the imagination it generates is priceless!<br /><br />Grab the popcorn and cranberries to string, sit by the lights of the tree, and prepare to be taken away to a wonderful place!!
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	I really thought this was going to be a pretty good one and it was going to take alot to convience me it wasnt great about less than halfway through it hit me this is not so good and thats how it was all the way through best way to decribe violence,nudity,weird and i like all of those things in a movie if done well,but this movie was i cant belive i would be saying this about this movie but boring.The 3 separet storylines didnt really intersect so it was never really intresting i was very disapointed I will give it three stars for originallity with the comic book look.I watched it on the DVD a was able to get an early copy(legally) just about every time someone speeks there is a high pitched ringing kind like when you have your ears checked its not my sound system was wondering if some else may have noticed this sound throughout the movie it is annoying.RENT especially if there is a special edition coming soon
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	Whenever I get a new exercise DVD I watch it first. These ones looked repetitive and boring. Well... Boy was I wrong! I'm in pretty great shape, but these basic exercises take me to the limit of pure insanity. I've gotten great results from the exercise  program and also its meal plan.<br />I am extremely happy with this DVD collection, and I would recommend it to anyone who desires to get into top shape very quickly. I dropped 2 sizes in two weeks!<br /><br />Happy & Insane in NYC
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	I like the DVD. I just wish the producers would have added deleted scenes from the movie into this edition.  I liked the tour of the set and the interviews.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I have a new appreciation for the Adams family and especially John and Abigail. Know how this man worked behind the scenes, fought his political battles with the likes of Jefferson and then became the best of friends..... he makes a good case for understanding John McCain. Anger management is not a requirement for the office.. but having the courage to do what is right.<br />Other than that, if the Emmy for best actor or series, writing etal.. is not awarded, I will be sorely tried.<br /><br />This is worth the purchase... you will want to view it again and again.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I kept hearing on the radio Jeff Dunham coming to town and the commercial sounded so funny. And then I saw part of his show on the comedy channel and laughed my butt off. So I got the movie, it is so funny that my younger siblings walk around quoting the characters. My Favorite characters are Walter and Peanut!!!!
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	I enjoyed it but looking back on it I don't know if i'll buy season 2.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Ben Stein's 'movie' is nothing more than a propaganda piece that doesn't dare to look at anything rationally and objectively.  If it had, he and his crew would have found out about the thousands and thousands of scientists that are able to do their jobs and hold their faiths both at the same time.<br /><br />It is not worth your time or money.  In fact, I am going to have to increase the amount of money I give the NSF, just to make up for the money I spent watching it in a theater...
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"As its harshest critics claim, it's a documentary with an agenda.  Maybe you could even call it propoganda, but ""propoganda"" doesn't necessarily mean ""false.""  The movie is in turns serious and funny and serious, with a powerful emotional appeal at the end.<br />It uses the Berlin Wall as a metaphor of the artificial barrier that most of the science and academic orthodoxy have imposed against any serious consideration of evidence for an intelligent agent as the source of life on earth.  Although maligned as religious creationism, the idea of Intelligent Design is shown to be worthy of at least some serious attention.  The arrogant bias of those who would censor it, and who have censored it, is proudly exposed by their own, unedited words.<br /><br />""Expelled"" is an excellent production that deserves wider publicity."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"This is the best use of your entertainment money.  It is an amazing, well-written docu-drama about the evolution of our country from English colonies through Jefferson's presidency.  To put words into the mouths of our Founding Fathers and get a strong sense of their personalities - John Adams in particular, of course -- is the best history lesson you can get. And be entertained to boot!!  The acting is superb, the visuals are stunning and the story, well, we all think we know it but it is astounding to ""see"" it in a modern way.  Beats a history book in high school any day.  Well worth the money.  Family can watch it together, too!"
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	"FULL METAL HARRY<br /><br />Saw Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix last night.  It is a War Movie, plain and simple.  What a disappointing story and a terrible message to send to kids.  Instead of using his intelligence and clever magic to overcome problems and threats, Harry starts his own (aka ""Dumbledore's"") Army and appoints himself the head drill Sergeant, who later leads his armed group of mercenaries into a classic battle at the end, complete with death, confusion, and destruction.  I was left asking myself why either Dumbledore's Army or the Death Eaters didn't just use their wands to create AK-47s and really get at it the conventional way?  After all, the main message in OOTP seems to be ""if you can't trick 'em, them kill 'em"".<br /><br />Harry's newly mature look is completely military too - short hair, clean-shaven, tight shirts, combat boots - What happened to the nice comfy academic robes with the cozy hoods?  We've got students being unfairly held captive and brutally tortured, a secret weapons training camp, and a small army of allied Centaurs attacking and abducting combatants behind enemy lines.<br /><br />Looks like the author JKR has become entirely caught up in the British-US global strategy of post- 9/11 military domination to deal with conflict, in lieu of research, knowledge, imagination and diplomacy. Seems that the movie's Writers/Director have been busy adapting every major scene from Platoon and Apocalypse Now for this new ""Harry Goes to War"" epic.<br /><br />Most of the critics are just pandering to the masses.  There ought to be a wake-up call to parents of young fans and viewers --  Keep them at home, the battles have just begun!"
B0006989TE	5.0	b	The Village is a great suspenseful, clean, thought provoking movie. Sound effects, music, and images are used very skillfully to engage those watching. This is one of my favorites and I hope more people watch this great work of art.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	EXCELLENT FOLLOW UP TO ARGUEING WITH MYSELF, NEW CHARACTERS ACHMED THE DEAD TERRORIST AND MELVIN THE SUPERHERO, LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	"I think the funniest part of his act it that his puppets ""say"" all of these politically incorrect comments and then he apologizes for them; and we buy it.  You completely forget that he's the one saying everthing."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This is a great movie to watch durning the holidays with the family. Leaves ya with a warm fuzzy feeling!!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	We had seen this movie before but it belonged to grandson. It's So creative! We bought Cars 2 and actually liked the first one best.  Grandson somehow goofed up his copy of Cars 1. We shopped & just couldn't find another one... We were told that Amazon had it, so we were happy to find it on Amazon!  It's great, and we're GLAD you had it.We should have looked on Amazon first.  You seem to have everything! Thanks!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	After doing some research on products that would help me and my fiancee stay fit and lose weight for my wedding that is in 10 months, I came across insanity. This 60 day total workout is awesome so far! As of now I lost 3 pounds and my fiancee lost 8 pounds. The only secret to insanity's success would be staying dedicated. Never miss a day, and push yourself. Shawn T is a great coach and watching the other people in the video make you feel like your at a gym taking a workout class. I recommend insanity to anyone who wants to get in shape and lose weight in a healthy way. Insanity you rock!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This is definitely a must have DVD. Jeff Dunham gives an excellent performance that is SURE to keep you laughing. If you don't own it already, you must buy it. You won't regret it.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Great movie, done in yet the same style as all of the rest of the Jones movies, well worth getting on blue-ray.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	Workouts are great, and time flies.  I like that it is a total body workout.  After 2 weeks, i am finally getting better at range of motion for the movements - ie, high knees.  The main workout (not including warm up/ cood down) is only about 20-30 min, so it is doable by most anyone - just modify to suit your needs.  The facial expressions from some of the participants - like they are dying - i could do without - Sean T keeps it real tho and doesn't make it seem too hard or too easy - it is what it is.  He offers modifications to some things and always stresses, form ahead of speed.  He always includes a very good warm up (you'll be working hard by the end of it) and stretching - which most of us never do enough of.  Be careful with your knees as there is a lot of jumping.<br />Basically, i am very glad i bought the set and plan to do the whole series through november/december (triathlon off season) - i think it has made a difference in my running already - legs are lighter/quicker.  But don't expect to loose tons of weight and get super lean on this - that's mostly genetics and nutrition.<br />i gave it 4 stars because they make it seem like you will become a super lean fitness model if you do this, and because some of the participants (ie Tonya) try to make it look really hard for them, when clearly it isn't  - and maybe because it may not be suitable with those of you that have knee or joint problems - but that is inherent in any speed/agility workout
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	For those with low attention spans, this is the perfect movie to watch. You will be (as critics like to say) 'on the edge of your seat' the whole way through. The role of Tony Stark was perfectly casted with Robert Downey Jr. who is satisfyingly hysterical! If someone asked for an entertaining action movie, I believe Iron Man is the one to recommend.
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	First of all, I give the film 5 stars, that said, the blu-ray is only worth 3.<br /><br />Why? Because the best way to veiw the film is as a film, not as 4 short films. Yes, it's great to be able to veiw both ways, but, why is the additional footage not in the feature-legnth cut? The extended version is not a complete film, it's each story re-edited to separate short-stories. It's not the same tension or experience as the theatrical cut, which would be improved by the added footage.<br /><br />Now the blu-ray quality is there, the film's AVC @ 22.mbps average, and the DTS MA is nice though I have yet to grasp why DTS MA is 24/48 and not 24/96 (truely thunderous audio!) Still, it's a visual feast, an excellent film. If you have the 2-disk DVD edition, this is the same thing, exactly, in hi-def.<br /><br />Certainly worth the hi-def upgrade, but lacking a true extended cut.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This product has not been tested yet since it is a gift, but since it is new there should be no problem. Fast shipping.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	This film was not what I had expected.  The comercials and advertising were very misleading.  Save your money folks!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	He's a great ventriloquist and he's funny to boot! You will laugh your butt off with this video.  I think what Jeff does best is switch so seamlessly between characters - whether that be the puppets or himself.  He does that at the drop of a hat - changes voice, pitch, mood - you name it, and so quickly, too.  It is truly uncanny.  He is the consummate professional.  Does 8 different puppets- characters, 9 if you include the puppet master.  My favorite is Walter.  Walter for President!  Anyway, if you buy this DVD, be warned - this material is NOT for children - adult content only (I would label it TV 14).  There is a bleeped version, but let's just say that even that version leaves little to the imagination.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	I bought used from a merchant.  For $74.00, I thought it was a good deal.  When it arrived, the cardboard case appeared to be scratched and worn yet everything was in shrink wrap including the insanity box.  I found that to be strange.  I popped the dvd's in only to find out it skipped from time to time, and one of the bonus DVD's had half of the workout missing!! I bought it again except through Beach body and compared the two.  Beach Body didn't skip, it didn't miss any of the workouts.  The tops of the dvds on the fake copy were blurry and dark compared to the bright vivid photos on the dvds.  People, do your research before you purchase!!  I highly recommend you only purchase through Beach Body on here.  Too many people counterfeiting these and it is better to be on the safe side!  Google this very topic, and you will see I'm not the only one that fell for this.  Even if the person selling the product claims it is new and original, it still may be a fake.  I did some more digging and found out through beach body message boards that these scumbags will get these cheap pirated knockoffs from china then sell them to us unknowing people here.  Please, I repeat, buyer beware!!  The workout is amazing and because of this, it is in high demand and that means some people will do what they can to pull one over on unsuspecting buyers and make a quick buck.  It is illegal to sell counterfeit products so if you encounter this, report report report!!  In the meantime, if you want your order to be genuine, best bet is to stick to beachbody.com.  It may be expensive but it will be high quality and you will get what you pay for.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I'm very glad that Robert Downey, Jr got his act together.<br />It is largely because he did that we have this film. He holds it on his shoulders ably.<br />Like other comic book based movies, I don't care about the source material at all.<br />The only question : Is the movie entertaining - yes it is, in fact is for that reason that I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />This movie is a master class in acting from Robert - whether that be comic or dramatic.<br />What other lead actor could play Tony Stark? Granted, that is an easy question, as there are not that many real 'actors' out there at the moment.<br />The reason I say this is that Robert has to play an unsympathetic yet occasionally charming and intelligent man.<br />This in itself is a challenge - which he rises to admirably.<br />People have to work with him, but they don't have to like him - in fact, that does lead to problems for the character.<br />Of course the supporting cast are right there with him - at or near his ability level.<br /><br />The last line of the film is delivered perfectly by Robert and leads in to the next movie.<br />The last line is perfect because everything previous to it leads there logically - it is the only possible culmination in the film's world. You are left hanging on with a sense of anticipation, yet you laugh as well.<br /><br />Perhaps one day we will see a Director's Cut of this, though I won't be surprised if we don't, as it is perfect.<br /><br />If I could add one thing to this Blu-Ray set, it would be a commentary by the director and stars.<br />Very highly recommended.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	I really enjoyed this movie. In fact, as far as comic book movies go, this was perfect. The script was the comic book; it followed it exactly. This is the only way Frank Miller would have had it. He's been approached for this movies several times in the past but rejected doing it simply because he wanted it to follow exactly to the comic. He didn't sell out like a lot of other comic book movies do. It's not Hollywood-ized at all. Perhaps this is why so many people just don't get this movie. If you view this movie as if you are viewing a comic book, then you get it. It is a film like no other.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez and Miller (who shared directing duties) did an amazing job with the filming. I love the way they used live actors with CGI backgrounds. The whole film (like the comic book) is black and white with touches of red and yellow. For example, in the beginning scene of the movie everything is black and white except for a woman's vibrant red dress and lips. This paints a very somber mood for the movie.<br /><br />I don't think they could have picked better actors for the roles of the characters. Everyone did a superb job. Elijah Wood was just down right creepy as a maniac who eats women and hangs their severed heads on his wall. Mickey Rourke just seemed at home on screen. He was perfect for the role and it just feels like he was the heart of Sin City; like this is where he lives. Bruce Willis is finally starting to play his age. In this he played an old cop with a heart condition. He's on the verge of retirement when he gets the biggest case of his carreer involving the senator's son. Then there is Clive Owen who plays the hard-guy who helps the prostitutes with a crocked cope played by Benicio Del Toro. Everyone just seemed to have fun playing their role and it was entertaining to watch them.<br /><br />From start to finish, this movie thrusts into momentum. There is no down time or lulls. Be forewarned though, the title is a dead giveaway for what you're in store for. There is nudity, prostitution, violence galore, cussing, killing, raping, kidnapping, eating, severing, bashing, dimembering...you name it...Sin City has it.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"When you looking at the barrel of a gun, what's the difference?  This movie was what I wasn't expecting.  I thought great, Donnie Brasco type of a movie where FBI goes undercover and blah blah blah.  Fuggittaboutitt!! Well, i can't forget about this movie!  Leo was great! Jack seems to always be great!  Mark W. was good as well as Matt Damon.  I thought for sure with all these good actors that the story script would get lost.  I kept thinking to myself, ""This is a good good good movie!!""  In a way, everyone saw the barrel, and it was no difference between good or evil.  Cops or Robbers.  I recommend this movie just for the mere thought of entertainment with all these good actors.  I wasn't disappointed and I thought for sure i was going to be!"
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	I ordered this the night of the Oscars. I will assume the mad rush to make as many dubs as possible was the reason for this atrocious copy. There wasn't even a booklet or insert of any kind included in the packaging. It looks like a bad VHS transfer. I should have returned it, but it would've been more trouble than it was worth.<br /><br />I thought the movie was everything it was cracked up to be - but unfortunately, in my case, I have to add: buyer beware.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Iron Man was a huge surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. Going into the summer of 2008, my attention was completely preoccupied with The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk, Kung Fu Panda, Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, Indiana Jones 4, Wanted, Hellboy II, Wall-E, Step Brothers and The Mummy 3. All of which were very hyped up titles that had people lining up for them. But, among them was one of the best comic book movies ever made. As much as I love The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder (they're in my top three favorite all-time movies), I think that Iron Man is superior to both of them in some ways. It is highly entertaining all the way through. It doesn't matter if you like Superheroes, or not. There is something in this film for just about everyone. The few action scenes are top notch. My personal favorite is the scene when Iron Man returns to the Middle East to destroy all of his weapons. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. was beyond perfect as Tony Stark. I am always glad to see A-listers give their all in these types of films because it proves that they are not just for children and geeks (honestly, we all still have a little of both in us). The rest of the amazing cast consists of Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and even Samuel L. Jackson in a surprise post-credits cameo. I also have to mention the director, Jon Favreau. I only knew him from comedies and tv, but he did a great job with this big blockbuster.<br /><br />Despite the great action, direction , and superb casting, the real key to this movie's excellence is the script. The writing is not quite as deep and dark as The Dark Knight, but for a supposedly ""summer popcorn action flick"", it is right on par. It never hurts to get a team of actual comic book writers along with the creator himself, Stan The Man, to guide you and tell you what fits, and what doesn't. That is the only way to make a comic book character come to life, just as he is on the pages. And in the end it will always pay off with the most important group in the audience, the fans. I cannot say that without admitting something though. I was never an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, although he does make an appearance in alot of my books. But I am very familiar with the character, not only from my comics that he is in, but also the cartoon from the 90's. I still try to catch episodes of the cartoon to this day. The reason I never got into his comic arc is because, I honestly had no interest in the villains he fought, except for the Hulk. Most of his villains were just big robots and monsters (Godzilla was actually one of them). With that said, I was still happy to see that they chose a very conventional first villain, Iron Monger. As long as they never make a movie with M.O.D.O.K., I will be happy.<br /><br />My only complaint about this movie is how scarce the action is. There are only really three scenes of action in total. I know it may seem a little hypocritical for me to complain about the action in Iron Man and give it a 90%, when I gave The Dark Knight 100%, and it had even less action than Iron Man. But the difference between the two is that Iron Man is an action movie, but in my opinion, The Dark Knight is a drama. Alot of people would probably disagree with that statement, but after watching both films many many times, that's the feeling I get about them. The action scenes that it does have are beautiful though. I just think Jon Favreau is not an action director, so he played it safe. In the end, that may have been why Iron Man was so great. I was just really surprised that Iron Man became one of my favorite movies. It reminds me of how I felt about Star Trek. I had my doubts, but those doubts were completely shattered after seeing it.<br /><br />I'll keep this very short because I cannot pretend to be a pro. As far as I can tell, the Picture Quality is reference material through and through. Grain is persistent thoughout, but that only means that they didn't scrub this beautiful transfer clean (which would have taken details away along with the grain). The beautiful effects by ILM are on full display, and i saw no obvious flaws. The same can be said for the audio too. I'm working with a very modest Home Theatre, but I can tell the difference between a good and poor soundtrack. I couldn't hear any apparent flaws. Fine work. As far as the Special Features fo, I loved them. Plain and simple. I just wish there was a damn audio commentary. Commentaries are essential to me, and I cannot help but dock the extras a whole point for there not being one. The one that Favreau did for Iron Man 2 was exactly what we want in a commentary, so it was a missed opportunity. Otherwise, the extras were brilliant.<br /><br />8.5/10"
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	another great feature. He is absolutely wonderful andgreat comedian. We have watch it over and over and shared with many people . Great for anyone!! highly reccomend.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"The  movies have become separate from the books and, in the case of Harry Potter, I think there is just more to love.  HP and the Deathy Hallows, Part 1 has slowed down a bit to let you catch up with the characters. Being a ""part 1"" there is a lot more exposition than the last 4 films: These characters have grown up and changed, the audience needs to catch up with the Harry,Ronald, Hermoine trio before that final conflict.  The screenwriter, as always, did a marvelous job of capturing the feel of the book and compressing it into length of this film.<br /><br />The dvd/blu-ray itself is just fine. It is a bit fun to be able to watch the movie with all the details and background added in and narrated by cast and crew (if you're interested)."
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	Why is everybody hating on this movie? I particularly found this to be an excellent movie! If you've seen it 3 times and still don't know what it's about then you must clearly be smoking some good indica. BREAKDOWN: Regular guy/2 million dollars found by regular guy/2 million dollars wanted back from a psychotic hitman..And the search for regular guy begins!!!  Easy enough?<br /><br />VI
B0006989TE	4.0	b	Great movie, but ending will make you throw the movie away. You should see it though, but i'd wait to see it for free.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	My children love Harry Potter, and all the movies.<br />I ordered the blue ray movies for another child who is old enough to enjoy all of them now.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	A wonderfully wicked guilty sin, but oh so fun to watch. This is definitely not for the youngsters, but utterly delicious for those of us who can handle it.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Absolutly incredible!!Enjoyed it so much bought his Arguing with my self too, and purshased a copy for my friend. If you want true entertainment buy this. He is very talented and funny. Quite original.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	when I saw this first on Comedy Central, I laughed hysterically, but then I bought the DVD, and watched the whole show and LAUGHED so hard, my side ached for days! Jeff is the funniest person I've seen!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	People were rather surprised when they heard I'd liked The Village. I usually go for movies like The Great Escape, It's a Wonderful Life, Anne, and Lord of the Rings, and this-people assumed-was a creepy horror movie.<br /><br />But then I started getting reports from a different set of people who said they were really disappointed because they thought it was going to be a terror of a movie, and-in their humble definitions-it wasn't. It wasn't scary enough, they all said.<br /><br />Well, I suppose I didn't go into the theater with expectations. There are parts that are very scary; even M. Night said he's still scared by one scene.<br /><br />But horror or no horror aside, it's a movie full of themes...innocence, deceit, love, beauty, fear...and that's what makes the movie so good. It is *very* worth watching.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	This is great. HD every time I can. The only catch was, I guess I didn't read it carefully enough because I thought that it came with 2 dvds, one HD one standard. They are on the same disk, one on each side and the bonus footage is only available on the HD side, so if you want to watch the bonus footage on another tv that isn't HD you better get another copy.<br />Enjoy.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	Lots of great extra features that include sneak peeks at HBP!  Don't overlook checking these out on the CD-ROM.  I also downloaded the digital version of the movie that was offered free with the two-CD edition.  Definitely worth it and what a difference in clarity.  Awesome movie - just as good the second, third, fourth....ad nauseum....time around.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"""Iron Man"" is one of the best comic book adaptations to find its way to the big screen. With sharper dialogue than ""Spiderman"" 1 and 2 and more irreverent energy than Tim Burton's ""Batman"" films, which would be its only competition, this is pure fun and a great start to a superhero franchise. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a self-absorbed playboy industrialist and wunderkind of the arms industry. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile, he is kidnapped by a militant faction who insist that he build them one of his new-fangled weapons. Assisted by the Afghani doctor (Shaun Toub) who saved his life, Stark constructs a bullet-proof, firethrowing, flying suit of armor to use in his escape instead. Upon returning to the United States, Stark finds that his priorities have changed. He plans to take Stark Industries in the direction of energy technologies, not weapons, which doesn't sit well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />As the first film in the franchise, ""Iron Man"" spends a lot of time on Stark's transformation. I never felt like the story was filler in between a bunch of overblown action sequences. The action never lasts very long. This is a good thing. It pushes the pace of the film while avoiding prolonged duels that can become tedious. I think it would be generous to call director Jon Favreau's previous work ""mediocre"", but I have to admit that ""Iron Man"" is a triumph. Favreau even successfully dealt with the challenge of making it interesting to watch someone build a machine or look at a computer screen. The key is that Stark is able to converse with his computer and make pithy comments to his robot while working. Not every actor would have been so amusing talking to himself, but Robert Downey, Jr. makes Tony Stark a lovable reformed rake. The film's only weakness is that Stark's leggy personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his military liaison Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) seem to be there only for decoration.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): The only bonus features on the single disc edition are 11 deleted or extended scenes and a publicity spot (1 min) for the upcoming Iron Man animated series. Plus there is a short but sweet Easter Egg (2 min) in which ""Iron Man"" co-creator Stan Lee talks about Robert Downey Jr. and his cameo appearance in the film.

B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"Although I was assured by my students that, if I liked the previous Harry Potter movies, I would love this one I found it a bit disappointing by comparison to the prior four movies. I can't quite put my finger on where the ""magic"" is lacking but the movie, overall, seems a bit flat. Maybe it'll grow on me with time?"
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"Saw the movie last week. Enjoyed it immensely and realized some of the plot holes people are mentioning is a deliberate mechanism to have plot lines feed into a sequel. A master film maker as Ridley Scott knows exactly what he is doing. Every penny spent is on the screen and the lead actors do a fine job. Glad the riddle of the Space Jockey was solved and while some of the storylines follow a predictable pattern ( nothing is original in this world..just how you treat it )it is things we have come to expect and enjoy.Like a rollercoaster ride.  . . and Charlene did look fabulous!....and now we know in the least where the alien creatures come from and their intended purpose in the whole scheme of things...can't wait for the dvd!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007055JQ8"">Bloodspiller: Book One: Warriors of Palahia Series</a>"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Cars is a delightful take-off on the real racing scene.  It's not just for children.  The tractor-tipping episode alone is worth the price of the movie, even though we'd seen it in the theater, already. We liked using the on-screen written dialog feature, which kept us from missing any of the words. If only they could have made the closing credits legible, it would have been perfect.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	I'm just not understanding where all these high rankings are coming from.  Were you people watching the same movie I was?  I should have known off of the back of the case.  It sounds like something out of a fairytale, with an enchanted forest in all.  The build up was ok but the monsters looked like something out a of low budget high schooler's english project.  The movie was way too slow.  I couldn't  understand what year it was supposed to be because in their little village they were stuck in the 1800's but when Ivy got to the outside, the rest of the world was in 2000 something.  I recommend watching something else.  Anything else.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	The DVD wasn't as funny as his last one, but this one is still very funny. Saw the show at the Warner theater the night this was taped, now that was fun!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I have seen Jeff Dunham for years, and this DVD captures this art at his best. There is just no one else like him...
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"If you like another ""Alien"" movie you might like this.  Follows similar story line Lot of action good visual effects"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	What more can be said....<br />Another hit Disney movie in HD...<br /><br />Now if only Disney would hurry up and release Finding Nemo on Blu-Ray!...
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"People who just rated the movie 1 star are being highly unfair to the creativity of the script and the talent of the actors. I bet that many of those ""1 star voters"" didn't even catch the symbolism in most of the movie. Sure there are moments that the audience cringes saying: why did that character DO THAT? But that adds to the suspense of the film. In crisis, not everyone makes the wisest of choices. Half of the movie I was yelling at the screen: ""Bad Robot!"". For me, he was the most interesting character besides Elizabeth (who by the way did a good job). As an audience member, half of the time I was wondering ""why is he doing that?"" and ""what is he thinking""?<br /><br />There are surprise moments in the film. I thought it was well paced and not slow.<br /><br />I'm rating it 4.5 stars for the overall combination of the concept, script, art, character design and acting. The symbolism is noticeable. It's all over the place. I won't spoil it here, but if you want to know more about it, google it.<br /><br />Yes, the creator of this work dropped some references to Alien in the movie, but if you've never watched it, those references do not distract from the plot."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	As mentioned in my title, I am 43 years old, roughly 30 pounds overweight and am eager to get back into the same shape as when I was 25. This is the very first fitness product of any kind I've ever purchased away from gym memberships because I believe that most are just gimmicks. I first saw Shaun T on the DR OZ show and was impressed with his fitness philosophies as well as being a legitimate trainer convincing me to make this purchase without regret.<br /><br />What you will get is a 13 DVD set that comes with a diet plan and a workout calendar in a pretty good quality case. I Don't know if the free T-Shirt will be available for those purchasing via Amazon.<br /><br />Anyway, this is my first week on the program and I will say that this workout is totally INSANE! Just the first DVD (Fitness Test) alone, beat every ounce of energy out of my now out-of-shape body. For someone who grew up fairly athletic, I found myself gasping for air in less than 10 minutes into it. Shaun T works out all muscles, core and most importantly, cardio with easy to follow step-by-step, day-by-day instructions. He continually pushes you to keep going and YOU WILL FEEL THE PAIN, but also stresses you not to exceed your max limit, risking injury.  I was able to keep up with the routines for so long. I was barely able keep up with his students for that matter. My heart said yes, but my body, of course, said no. I  kept pushing and pushing. My heart was racing, muscles raging and knees buckling. It really was HELL!<br /><br />With that said, this program is not for everyone. I believe it requires one to be in the right frame of mind. Nevertheless, once you choose to proceed and if you are not built like Shaun T or in excellent shape, It is highly suggested that beginners start the exercises at half speed. You will enjoy it more, working your way up to par. I will say that I had a good time struggling through it so far and will continue on for 7 more back breaking weeks to achieve the results I am longing for.<br /><br />GOOD LUCK and ENJOY!
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	"4.5 stars<br />""Sally: Forty years ago, that interstate down there didn't exist.<br />Lightning McQueen: Really?<br />Sally: Yeah. Back then, cars came across the country a whole different way.<br />Lightning McQueen: How do you mean?<br />Sally: Well, the road didn't cut through the land like that interstate. It moved with the land, it rose, it fell, and it curved. Cars didn't drive on it to make great time. They drove on it to have a great time. ""<br /><br />'Route 66, Get Your Kicks on Route 66'- remember that song that solidified the reason for driving to the west on that great highway? As we all knew, the interstates took over and Route 66 is driven only for pleasure, now. Wait a minute, isn't that what driving and vacations are supposed to be?<br /><br />I am usually not an animated film fan, but I think I have been through a conversion, If I wanted to understand my three year old grandaughters fascination with someone called 'Lighting McQueen' I realized I had better get with it. She and I watched this movie, and I fell in love with the story, the animation, the color, the depiction, the soundtrack and the characters. Sally and Lighting' McQueen, Mater, and Doc. Who could better convey life's lessons than these cars in a movie directed towards all of us? Not only is this a knock-out movie but it kept my interest for two hours. My granddaughter told me ""there are some scary parts, gramma, but they go by fast', and she was correct. The Director knows his stuff and the animators and illustrators and the entire kit and caboodle put together a story so well done that this is a must see.<br /><br />he cast of characters could not be better, what voices, what style, they convey the feel of the story with such joie de vive.<br /><br />Owen Wilson .... Lightning McQueen (voice)<br />Paul Newman .... Doc Hudson (voice)<br />Bonnie Hunt .... Sally Carrera (voice)<br />Larry The Cable Guy .... Mater (voice)<br />Cheech Marin .... Ramone (voice)<br />Tony Shalhoub .... Luigi (voice)<br />Guido Quaroni .... Guido (voice)<br />Jenifer Lewis .... Flo (voice)<br />Paul Dooley .... Sarge (voice)<br />Michael Wallis ....

Flea Car (voice)<br />Joe Ranft .... Red/Peterbilt (voice)<br />Michael Keaton .... Chick Hicks (voice)<br /><br />The theme of the movie is winning at any cost and life's little diversions that teach us well. Lighting McQueen is the star, but each and every character is integral to the plot and the movie. We all know that we can't have everything, but a little bit is ok!<br /><br />The soundtrack was scored by Randy Newman and it is fabulous. The music lifted me up and I recognized Randy Newman's stamp all over. Rascal Flatts sings the hit ""Life Is a Highway,"" The highlight is Sheryl Crow's ""Real Gone"". John Mayer sings the theme ""Route 66"", and Chuck Berry's version is also included. ""Opening Race,"" and ""Bessie"" does George Thorogood a turn. Randy Newman delivers a wonderful song in"" Our Town,"" sung by James Taylor. The soundtrack is available on CD.<br /><br />The Director, ""Lasseter tells Michele Norris how the idea for the film grew out of a two-month summer trip he took with his family after working nonstop during the 1990s. During that time, he directed the box-office hits A Bug's Life and both Toy Story movies, and served as executive producer for Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo.<br />""I learned that the journey in life is a reward,"" he says. ""It's about living every day to its fullest, and I knew that's what I wanted the film to be about."" Lasseter talks about Cars, the challenges of directing an animated film, and how technological advances have -- and haven't -- affected his work. NPR, Morning Edition<br /><br />'Cars' is one of those movies that you tell friends about, urge them to see, by the DVD for family, and even promote this movie to your children.<br />So highly recommended. prisrob 01/01/06"
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	"A mess. Boring, non-involving and poorly acted. Note to the actors: staring off into the distance with a perpetually concerned expression does not qualify as good acting! Nor does a dark, moody atmosphere qualify for a mature movie. I'm tired of this grossly misguided philosophy that ""dark"" somehow equals ""mature"" or ""adult"". Anything but a mature work, HPATDH plays as if it were written by an untalented teenager, with no sense of pacing, character, or where to place emphasis.<br />The movie also suffers from a severe case of tonal inconsistency, mixing bad comedy with eye-rolling melodrama. And should I mention the effects? No, let's be nice. Let's just say I have the strong suspicion that most of the budget ended up in the actor's pockets.<br /><br />I am amazed at how easily people are amused by this over-blown kiddie matinee.<br /><br />Don't like my review? Well, tough."
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	This is not a movie that you should be really pressed to see.  It's just ok.  It doesn't live up to the hype or expectations of Iron Man 1.  There's not much action, it's more about Tony and his problems...(like we all have).  Even the actions scenes are just ok.  All in all it's just OK!!  See my pattern here...(OK).
B0006989TE	5.0	b	I guess I am in the minority, but I really enjoyed The Village. I'm not a fan of monsters, ghosts, or aliens, so these are not my main interest. I also loved Signs, but not for the alien stuff. I loved the story of a man losing his faith and finding it again.<br /><br />What to say without giving IT away? It is a story about love and truth. The acting is superb (although I agree with other reviewers that the talent of Adrian Brody seemed wasted as Noah, the village idiot). Bryce Dallas Howard embodied faith and courage as young Ivy Walker, the blind heroine of the movie. The cinematography was so incredible. The subtle play of light and color added layers of meaning and emotion to every scene.<br /><br />If you want fast-paced action, blood and guts, monsters - then this movie is NOT for you. Don't even bother, you'll just hate it.<br /><br />However, if you want to plumb the depths of love and truth; ask yourself how far you would go for a loved one; what is morally and ethically permissible to protect a loved one, by all means see this movie.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Hilariously funny and very entertaining.  There is a bleeped and an unbleeped version to suit individual taste.  Jeff Dunham is a talented comedian and ventriloquist; hope to see more from him.
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	"I have been a vegetarian for almost all of my adult life and a vegan for the last few years.  I started out for ethical reasons, but even if I stopped caring tomorrow I would still eschew animal products.  The way they are produced is just too scary.  I've been reading about these issues for over twenty years, so there was little that surprised me.  For me, the value of the film was showing the human costs, both direct and indirect, in our food system.<br /><br />Let's back up- this film and many others like it would have you believe that McDonalds, Walmart and Tyson invented the model for the farm, restaurant and supermarket as factory.  They didn't.  We've been mechanizing our food systems to the best of our ability since we started trading in and consuming sugar.  The scary part now is that we can do it so much more ""efficiently"" than we could before because our technology has improved so much.<br /><br />The hell of sugar was the way it not only depended on slaves but literally destroyed them.  Slavery has been outlawed, but the conditions under which laborers in the food industry work are little better than what the slaves labored in.  One of the farmers makes the point that ""Big Food"" previously depended on African American men to, literally, do their dirty work.  Now it's undocumented workers.  One of the prices our country pays for cheap food.<br /><br />The story about the little boy who died after eating contaminated hamburgers- and then the inability of the corporation to apologize- drew both tears and indignant gasps.  And well it should.  Even worse, what people can say about food companies- Food, Inc- is heavily restricted.  When someone can sew Oprah Winfrey for speaking out against a food company, no one is safe.  And that's a shame.<br /><br />It was the story about the small family trying to balance the costs of food and health care that showed what the true cost of our food system really is.  Other organizations have cited that we spend the same 26% of our incomes on healthcare and food combined as we did forty years ago.  The difference is that we used to spend 18% on food and 8% on healthcare; now it's reversed.  Actually, the biggest difference is that we used to have a better quality of life when we did.<br /><br />It's a powerful film, especially for children, especially for meat eaters (although the message is emphatically not that everyone has to become a vegetarian).  But... it's not the comprehensive indictment of the food system I thought it would be.  They focus on one quirky, independent farmer as part of the solution.  What about more about CSAs?  What about how to make all of that work in a city?  (It felt like this, as well as many other films on the subject, was talking to someone in the suburbs.)  And while I understood what they were saying about Walmart being potentially part of the solution, there's A LOT more to that story, such as how vulnerable businesses become when 40 to 60% of their business becomes dependent on Walmart- and keeping them happy.<br /><br />This is a very good work and it should be required viewing in school.  It's just not the final, most comprehensive resource."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This product is fantastic. It definitely kicks your butt, but it is so worth it. The workouts are not your typical workouts and I really like that. I also like that it comes with different booklets, especially the nutrition/meal one and the calendar that tells you which workout to do each day to maximize weight loss and strengthening.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	While the acting can be a bit cheesy, the message is very moving. A must watch for today's youth, who grow to have less and less respect for marriage and family.
B001KZG99A	2.0	b	It has quite a few funny dialogues. The plot has depth. It shows the weaknesses of Ironman. For example, he recovered from alcohol addiction. It makes him more human. The special effects are so-so. It's worth seeing once.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone that has a sense of humor!
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	The movie was not quite what I expected and the relation to Alien is not as clear as one would expect. In fact, its a bit of a puzzle how the two movies could connect without having the obvious contradiction that this movie would have happened BEFORE Alien and nevertheless they have far more advanced technology here. That said, the movie is good and provides an interesting background and explanation for some of the things you see in Alien. The story is a bit weak towards the end and not some scenes do not make a lot of sense. However, the special features (Deleted scenes, alternate scenes - if your edition offers them) definitely add to the story. I think they should have been included in the movie and it would have made it much clearer. But maybe the decision was to keep the movie a bit shorter and more fast paced, I would have enjoyed a slower, more detailed movie more. Also the director's commentary is worth to listen in, it gives more details on the ideas behind scenes and helps to understand the movie. As a fan of Alien 1-3 (I don't like Alien 4 and I didn't even try the Alien vs. Predator stuff) I think this is a great movie and makes a nice addition to the set. If you have never seen Alien and are not into SciFi movies, keep your hands off.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	This review isnt about the movie itsself.. I absolutely love this movie.. Ibought this blu-ray copy to analyze the video ...  The wide screen format is ok i suppose but i prefure full screen..  I have an excellent copy of this in a standard full screen dvd.. There is very little or no differance in the video quality... on this movie the blu-ray just isnt worth it....
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I have watched this DVD 3 times with different family members and friends since it arrived in early December.  I laugh as much as I did the first time I saw it, if not more.  Each time I pick up details that I didn't see before when I watched.  The material is extremely funny.  His interaction with the various dummies brings them alive.  They each have individual mannerisms and I forget that they are inanimate objects.  This is especially true when he has Peanut and Jose Jalape&ntilde;o on a Stick having a conversation and arguing with each other.  Jose is complaining to Jeff and Peanut is laughing to himself over what he did to Jose at the same time. The talent it takes to switch back and forth between characters, accents and mannerisms and make it believable is pure artistry!  I highly recommend this DVD!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Love this one.  There hasn't been a good ventriloquist since Ronn Lucas and you can't get that on DVD that I can find.  Both of Jeff's are off the wall funny and quite enjoyable.  Great pick me up for a laugh fun hour or so.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	"With all the hype about this movie I thought it would be entertaining enough to keep my girl friend awake.  She falls asleep during every movie we see.  This time I fell asleep twice. Some good scenes but this movie is boring, jumpy in terms of characters and ""what the hell does that mean"" in terms of one liners and dumb look scenes like at the very end.  This could have been a real good movie if some consistency and thought had been placed in making things like the journey over regular countryside more dangereous and longer than through the deadly dark forrest.  And the troll???????  As to her acting, well two dimensions, is two dimesnisons."
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	"It would be dark and awesome, especially after seeing its amazing cover. The storyline is okay. Vampires ""coming out of the coffin"" since the invention of Tru:Blood. And about them living - or being dead? - among human life. The sex is insulting to people who have an IQ. The language makes you wish you couldn't hear. And the totally fake Southern accents in itself is a slap to the face of real people of the South and Louisiana.<br /><br />For it to be a vampire show, there's not much gore and blood in it. The only gore in it is when a vampire is killed or the serial killer strikes again. Biting is, of course, expected. The show doesn't even look like it should be made for adults it is so mindless. This could be TV-14 if it weren't for the sex and language. Apparently everyone in Bon Temps drinks at Merlotte's Bar and Grill and sleeps around. The F-word is so casually used it's almost disturbing. Then, not to mention, the perfect Sookie Stackhouse, whom everyone loves and wants to protect from scary Vampire Bill. Sookie is a virgin and doesn't drink, lives with her Gran, and has a sex-addict of a brother, Jason Stackhouse. Even as the seasons progressed, Sookie is still looked upon as innocent and fragile, even though she curses a lot, too, and has recently discovered a passion for sleeping with her dead boyfriend, as bizarre as that sounds.<br /><br />The show just looks like porn with a currently popular storyline. The books even read like it is aimed for the young adults. But seemingly mature ones. The books are ""better"" than the show, but not saying it's good, either. When I saw this in stores, the season one DVD, and not knowing at the time the show was at all related to the Sookie Stackhouse Novels, this looked killer. TV-MA. So there would be a lot of violence and gore, some language, and I hoped no sex like it actually is. Of course with a vampire show I expected there to be some language and sex, just not like this. There is more than one scene per episode, and that's ridiculous, even for a horny adult.<br /><br />I mainly expected it to be TV-MA 'cause of strongly explicit violence. But when I purchased episode one on iTunes, it was garbage. Trashy, foul-mouthed, and more like a cheap soap opera instead of a vampire show. The acting was so fake even for television, cheesy, lame, and truly a waste of my time.<br /><br />I hope you won't consider purchasing this. If you aren't familiar with the show and what it's about, or the books it was ""based"" on, do yourself a favor and don't buy this. If you want gory, bloody action and exciting storylines and halfway decent, do not expect to find it in anything True Blood. You'd think with a name like True Blood it'd be cool - but it's really just not. It is terrible and cheap.<br /><br />*** Please note when I said I only really expected it to be TV-MA for violence/gore, is because I have never watched anything on HBO, therefore I didn't know what to expect."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"The HBO series John Adams is a must see! If not for Adams, we wouldn't have become an independent nation. The producers and director did an outstanding job recreating his life and times. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGWQG8"">John Adams (HBO Miniseries)</a>"
B00447G29S	1.0	b	Simply poor. The quality of the 3D and the glasses are as poor as one can see, or not. Do not waste money on this!
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"""Iron Man"" is one of the best action movies I have seen in quite some time. Not a graphic novel reader, I was unaware of the plot until I saw the movie. The writing, acting and production work all came together and produced a wonderfully entertaining escape for fiction lovers like myself. I would even recommend this movie to those who do not usually watch science fiction or fantasy action films. Well done."
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	I was thoroughly looking forward to watching this film on DVD, after having seen it many months ago in the theaters.<br /><br />Well, the picture quality on the DVD is horrible.  There are a lot of dark scenes, and the blacks and blues just look terrible.  The scene with Hagrid and the kids in the forest are even worse, since there is a dark, reddish brown ground under their feet.  It just looks like the pixels are 5 times too big.<br /><br />Bad digital transfers like this make me wish that I had an HD DVD or Blu Ray player.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Great movie, lot better than expected. More action than i thought would be in it. Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron made the movie great Would reccomend this movie if you are into scifi and fantasy.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	The DVD was just perfect and there are no problems with it.  I wish the movie however had more info from the book but the book was over 800 pages and would be watching a very long movie if it contained it all.<br /><br />This book was my least favorite but sets up for the next book.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Food Inc. is extremely informative and a bit shocking. I wasn't expecting to see some of the things that were in this movie. I like that the documentary isn't trying to make the viewer a vegetarian or paranoid. It really made me think of my food in a different way. I will try to buy organic and fresh produce when I can. Food Inc. covers a wide range of food from meat and poultry to produce and soy beans. I have to admit watching the pig portion of the movie did bring some tears to my eyes. I am glad this movie was made so that more people like myself can be better informed about the food we eat. I highly recommend watching this.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	This movie was exciting when I saw it in the theater. It brings to a culmination the battle between good and evil.
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	An A-list cast is wasted in this overlong & unimaginatively scripted remake of an excellent Asian thriller. Relocating the action from Hong Kong to Boston the plot twists of the original are dutifully reproduced but writer Bill Monahan fails to add anything new. In the original story a gang of criminals have a mole in the police and the police have a mole in the gang. As cop and criminal try to ferret out the other each begins to wonder who he truly is. For example the mole in the police wonders where his real loyalty lies while the undercover cop fears losing his true identity. Scorsese's remake dispenses almost entirely with this rich theme & turns the mole in the police force (played by Matt Damon) into an inexpressive walking blank spot & DiCaprio (playing the cop turned criminal) into a panic stricken caricature. Jack Nicholson does significant damage to the movie by overacting appallingly as a gang boss with an obsession about informers, said obsession signaling an all too obvious 'surprise' revelation concerning his character.<br /><br />In the original movie each of the leading men found comfort, along with an exploration of their identity crisis, in their relationship with a woman. But Scorsese's remake lazily merges the two women into one & in another unconvincing development has her sleeping with both of them! Of all the actors only Mark Wahlberg as a vulgar cop & Ray Winstone as Nicholson's psychotic enforcer make an impression.<br /><br />As for Scorsese, who is now in his mid-60's, his direction here feels tired & unengaged. His trademark combination of contemporary music & classics with scenes of graphic violence lacks the impact it once had although it must be admitted that the mediocre material he's working with does him no favours. Unable to control Nicholson (or perhaps encouraging him to overact. Who knows?) The Departed feels - most notably in its silly 'let's-kill-everybody' ending - like a parody of his earlier gangster films. Slick, profane & violent but also hollow, superficial & juvenile, The Departed will be forgotten faster than you can say 'I'm shipping up to Boston.'
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"With most stand-up routines, things can be hit and miss. You'll get a funny bit, then another not-so-funny bit. This dvd of Jeff Dunham's live performance is consistantly funny, and yet also unique for his use of ventriloquism. With the ""unbleeped"" version you will get swearing but coming from a bunch of puppets it's both acceptable and incredibly funny. Likewise, audience members genuinely laugh when they're picked on by these puppets, rather than take offense.<br /><br />My favourite moment - one of the puppets imitating a Japanese Godzilla movie. You know what I mean, when their lips are out of synch with the soundtrack, and their mouth stops moving but they're still speaking.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching - you won't be disappointed!"
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This set makes history come alive.  Wish I could have learned my history this way when in school.  I liked the way it showed the first lady, Abigail, as the strong and important influence that she was.  We don't hear enough about the women who forged our country
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	No technical problems for me but I didn't try to stream.  I downloaded to my Tivo.  Worked perfectly.<br />The film itself frankly felt way too dark to be a Harry Potter film.  It's taking itself way too seriously.  Also I hated the colored lens work. in this one.  If you are really, really into everyone being green, this is the film for you.  It was also way too long, though this is really the fault of J. K. Rowling.  You can tell when an authors gotten too big for their own good, they clearly stop listening to their editors.  Rowling is a classic example of this problem.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	THIS GUY IS AMAZING.  I LAUGHED SO HARD.  IT IS SUPER GOOD!
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	I bought the DVD version and could not see the whole movie. The movie runs well for a while then stops and goes back to scenes already seen. So I tried to fast forward on the scenes that jump back but instead I end up skipping other scenes. So, I guess I will end up renting it at a video store.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is Definately Entertaining. You will laugh throughout the whole cd. His Ability to Throw his voice, w/ all those amazing charatures, is incredible.  I would recomend it to anyone  who likes standup comedians w/ a twist. Jeff's great abilities, with all his wonderful little friends!!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Sin City is a stylish comic turned movie directed by Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) and featuring a star-studded cast including Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Benecio Del Toro (Traffic), Jessica Alba (Honey), Mickey Rourke (Get Carter), Rutger Hauer (Nighthawks), Clive Owen (Closer), and Elijah Wood (the Lord Of The Rings trilogy). The movie also features cameos by Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile), Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), Michael Madsen (Kill Bill), Nick Stahl (Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines), Brittany Murphy (8 Mile) and many others. The film also features behind the scenes work by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) who revised some of the script and directed a few scenes.<br /><br />Sin City comes straight from the comic by Frank Miller, who also takes the helm as co-director. It's a gritty tale of lowlives caught up in disturbing tales of deception, crime and murder. What makes the movie so eccentric is the black and white effect in addition to the bizarre characters, especially Marv played by Rourke and Kevin played by Wood.<br /><br />I can tell that Sin City will be loved by many and hated by some, but it is bound to be one of the most memorable movies of the decade.<br /><br />Sin City is a comic book come true!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Hands down, the best movie of the year!!!<br />Clean but very exciting, kinda like the Bourne movies.
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	I started watching this and thought I missed a movie in the series. Not having read the books (although being a fan of the movie series), I found the story confusing and a little tedious. It was a disjointed and convoluted series of scenes mashed together without purpose or reason.<br /><br />In my opinion the entire movie could have been condensed into a brief narrative at the beginning of the next movie (much like this movie started. Referring to events that didn't occur onscreen, but apparently caused major changes to secondary characters and relationships).
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Iron Man looks the BEST on a kindle fire or other devices! It has PERFECT affects and PERFECT sounds and everything! I reccomend you to watch Iron Man on your device or even on a disk! Truthfully I think that Amazon did an amazing job with this movie!!
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	I just saw this movie.  It's intended to be over-the-top, but it goes so far over that it becomes a self-parody.  The writing is cheesy and cliched, and the actors can't help but overact to match.<br /><br />It's also interesting that the only jobs available to women in this movie's world are scantily clad waitresses, strippers, naked lesbian parole officers, and whores.  I'm all for T&A, but this was ludicrous.<br /><br />If you want to see excellent film noir that's sexy, violent, and amoral, check out Romeo Is Bleeding.  Only see Sin City if you want to laugh yourself sick.

B00447G29S	4.0	b	Just as expected.  Good DVD.<br />3D needs a better set of 3D glasses
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	This sham movie is not worth the plastic it is printed on.  Stein drags out one tired fallacy after another and quote-mines actual scientists in a pitiable attempt to make creationists martyrs of the scientific process.  It's ridiculous and sad that a speechwriter for Nixon and quasi-actor is trying to tell scientists how to do research.  It's a sham from beginning to end, as is Stein.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"Buena Vista Home Entertainment has announced the release of Disney & Pixar's latest animated blockbuster, ""Cars"", which will be available in both widescreen and pan & scan editions on the 7th of November. The single-disc release will present the film with an anamorphic transfer at its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and include the brand new animated short ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" as well as the Academy Award nominated short ""One Man Band"". Other extras will include a behind-the-scenes featurette entitled 'Inspiration For Cars', four deleted scenes, and a preview for Disney & Pixar's upcoming feature, ""Ratatouille""."
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"Like every other film by M. Night Shyamalans films, we are left to figure out the big twist at the very end that will be sure to make our hair stand on end as they did in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs.""<br /><br />However this one twist in the movie tends to be toned down a bit, which is sort of a surprise and kind of a dissapointment, considering Shyamalan has been on a role. Nonetheless this film is still full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing till the end, it did for me.<br /><br />The main plot is that a village of people, that is set sometime in the 1800's, are completely cut off from the world. They live in their small town surrounded by woods where these creatures also live in.<br /><br />At first we do not know much about them except for the fact that they are called, ""Those we do not speak of,"" by the townsfolk, and also the fact that they are attracted to the color red. Whether the color is on clothes, berries, or flowers, the color is called the ""bad color"" and is buried in the ground right away if seen anywhere near the village. The people in the village do not go into the woods, and the creatures in the woods do not go into the village.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix plays Lucius, a quiet young man that does not fear the creatures, in fact he does not fear anything at all, except for the saftey of another which I will talk about later.<br />As far as the plot is concerned, Lucius is only in the first half as a man who has to write out what he wants to say in order for him to actually say it.<br /><br />When dead animals start to show up in the village many people are afraid that the creatures are starting to break the truce they have with people. At first they pretend the acts are by coyotes, but when more and more start showing up, the people start to worry even more.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the movie does try to stick to the plotline, several moments were pretty slow, but Shyamalan tries to keep it interesting by showing several moments of suspense that only he can deliver, including a few seconds of us actually seeing the creatures in the light. And believe me, they are nothing what you will expect.<br /><br />Bryce Dallas Howard makes her acting debut I believe in this movie as Ivy, the daughter of the leader of the town who is also blind. But she is a remarkable person who can actually do a lot of what other people cant, and she is great in this movie. She is also the character that Lucius is afraid of for her safety.<br /><br />And to those of you who saw the movie ""The Pianist"" did you actually think you would see Adrian Brody as the character that he is here? Kind of a real shocker if you think about it.<br /><br />As for the scary scenes, they definately deliver, my opinion, and are relatively evened out in the movie, though the first hour rearely has them. The scene in the woods with Ivy I'll admit were suspensful, and it was in daylight too.<br /><br />The ending isn't the greatest, but this definately isn't the worst movie you will see. Sure it isn't on the same level as Shyamalan's others, but everyone has to take a break now and then, right? Anyway this is a great movie to rent, and definately not worth throwing it in the trash."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	This is really deep. Ya gotta watch it twice to really get a grip on it. You notice something new each time you see it. Really great for an adult or older teen crowd! A little potty mouth at times, but an older teen hears worse at school!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I came into the theater not knowing what to expect, having never read any of the comic books (in fact, I didn't even know it was a comic book at the time), and I was enthralled.  The sets, the characters, and the CGI were all outstanding.  Sin City grabs you from the initial scene and drags you into a world of crime, corruption, and prostitution, and by the time its over you have to shake to remind yourself that you're back in the real world.<br /><br />Almost the entire film is in deep, dark black and piercingly bright white, you really feel like you're in a comic book.  The occasional color is only used for emphasis (kind of like Snoop Dogg's ""Drop It Like It's Hot"" video), and it works, on so many different levels.  While a little confusing at times, this movie reminds me a little of the Max Payne Video Game series, with the constant narration and graphic violence.  I recommend this film to anyone who likes comic books, graphic violence, or just wants to see a great story and interesting characters."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Great movie whether you (man or woman alike) are in a relationship or married.  It can also help you understand how to get along with people in general.  We consider this to be a 'B rated' movie (acting-wise), but watch it (with NO interruptions), and take the meaning to heart with an open mind and it will blow you away!  It has brought tears to macho men and be prepared for the surprise ending.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	jeff dunham, walter and the wole gang is absolutly hilarious. more than well worth the money it was bought for.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	This movie is a complete sham. I've lost all respect for Ben Stein for making a movie that the facts are so manipulated to match his point of view. Before taking this movie as factual, please do research on your own and study evolution (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) and compare it to what he presents, you'll see that he's upright lying on his interpretation of it.<br /><br />Here's a video with some exerts from Ben Stein's interviews about the movie, that breaks down on how his knowledge of evolution is completely void.<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZVAAvB8l4o&NR=1<br /><br />Another link regarding the movie http://www.expelledexposed.com/
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	This is great. HD every time I can. The only catch was, I guess I didn't read it carefully enough because I thought that it came with 2 dvds, one HD one standard. They are on the same disk, one on each side and the bonus footage is only available on the HD side, so if you want to watch the bonus footage on another tv that isn't HD you better get another copy.<br />Enjoy.
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	I didn't like his two new characters at all. I still love the old man, peanut and jalapeno on a steeeek. They are still my all time favorites.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie is great for any couple to see.  Learn how to view your partner how God does.  This movie and the program that it represents has helped to save hundreds of marriages.  Keep up the great work!<br /><br />Tim Harris<br /><br />[...]
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	This documentary was well put together, with depth, research, non-contrived interviewee responses, revealing and insightful. I don't see how any honest person can walk away from this documentary.....without thinking.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	I cannot for the life of me understand all the bad press surrounding this movie. I'd managed to avoid hearing what the twist was until actually viewing it; obviously the movie would be a lot less fun if you knew what was going to happen. And while I did more or less figure out what was going on, I was still glued to my seat and scared silly. M. Night knows how to build tension and keep it going for sustained periods. IMHO, The Village is a *lot* better than critics gave it credit for, and definitely worth watching.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Loved this DVD.  Found it to be an accurate accounting of what happened during this time period.  Paul Giamatti was fantastic in his portrayal of John Adams.  Glad to have it added to my historic collection.  Would use this seller again. Thanks!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie is exactly what I hoped for. It arrived on time and my daughter loves it! I would recommend buying this movie and the seller!
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	Amazon, you didn't let me post this comment the first time on grounds of profanity. If BS is profanity, check this link out; it has BS in it, too. Don't worry, you're not gonna have any problems seeing it, it's all in CAPS.<br />I'm sure there are hundreds more with BS in it out there . So, my review of this piece of junk, is complete BS.

B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	now this is something i would like to give 5 stars. way better than lot of animation movies.<br /><br />this is one of the best. even better than the incredibles.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I Thought I would be very disappointed walikng into this movie, it being the shortest film and the longest book to date in the series. Boy was i wrong. this film takes you an an adventure like no other, and is an outstanding film, Classifying itself as the different of all the other Harry Potter films. Sure, things are left out, it being an 870 page book turned into a 2 hour, 18 minute movie. But it still is Excellent and keeps you on the edge of your seat, even the parts with the less-than-sweet Dolores Umbridge who you cant resist hating. I rate this a 5 out of 5, and the best Harry potter film to date!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Picking Robert Downney Jr to play Tony Stark simply guaranteed this movie wouldn't stink........... Downey steals the show without taking away the main character of Tony Stark & the Tin Man as being the center of the story. (ie. some actors are so good, you forget who theyre playing and just pay attention to ""them"" and not their ""character"".)<br /><br />Marvel got it right this time - it's a shame that Incredible Hulk didnt get the same results, nor probably will Punisher WarZone which should have been a straight-to-DVD release. They can redeem themselves if they dont make the world wait 10 years for the Avengers."
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	I really enjoyed this movie. it's the typical Indiana jones.. I've already watched this 3 times and always enjoyed it. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	I enjoyed it. I would watch it again. It is more than a 3 star movie, but it has to be really good for me to rate a movie 4 stars.<br /><br />Well done. Pleasantly surprised.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	I've seen pretty much every Disney movie ever made, to include the live action and made-for-TV movies.  I grew up with them, and AM a grown-up that still loves them.<br /><br />That being said, I was very disappointed with a slew of movies released by the company in the late 90's and into the early 00's.  They seemed empty, mere gimmicks for marketing and devoid of any sort of viable plot.<br /><br />After seeing some of the initial reviews for this movie, I knew I had to check it out.  It was rated VERY highly, and I hoped that so many people couldn't be wrong about this movie.<br /><br />This movie was incredible.  The animation is top-notch (computer animation has come a long way since Tron and The Last Starfighter). The voices are definitely on the mark for the characters.  And the plot...simplistic, but it's nice to see solid growth in the main character and a good resolution, with a little ribbing on the sourpusses of the movie.<br /><br />Cars is more than just watchable...I've seen it several times, and have noticed new things going on every time.  This is definitely a positive direction for Disney, and I hope they keep it up.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I first received a defective copy as it would not play in my machine. Upon notification to Amazon, they immediately issued an order for a replacement copy and emailed me a UPS return label at no charge. They shipped the replacement FedEX and I had a functional set within 2 days of receipt of the first one. Great customer service and great response.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	If I wanted to watch a movie about a bunch of lies I'd watch the Santa Clause
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Many of the Marvel Films projects--outside of the Spider-Man (thus far) trilogy--have met with some very mixed results and reviews.  One is left wondering if Marvel has rushed their Universe out there too quickly.  Certainly, Iron Man--given to Jon Favreau to direct, and the controversial decision to go with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark--left many pondering if the right decisions were made in production and casting.<br />  Well...THAT WAS SETTLED.<br />  What we found out was that RDJ was not just a good pick, but a GREAT pick to play the hard-partying, hard-drinking weapons manufacturer who, when captured by terrorists who want him to make a weapon, comes up with a Ned Kelly-like suit of iron (The suit us fanboys recognize as the original Iron Man suit), and proceeds to get medieval on the terrorist encampment.  There were many who thought that Oded Fehr (Of ""The Mummy"" and ""Resident Evil"" movies) was the more likely choice to be Stark, but RDJ--and his own personal history with alcohol and drugs can't be dismissed in this casting--is nothing short of brilliant.  At points, RDJ does his usual fast-paced one liners and makes them part of Stark, but there are points that--with the epiphany his character has about 40 minutes in--that Downey becomes the performer we saw in ""Chaplin"".<br />  The casting is incredibly solid--Gwynneth Paltrow's return to work as Pepper Potts, Jeff Bridges' take on Obidiah Stane, and Terrence Howard's military liason to Stark, James Rhodes...plus, we can all see the sequel (or sequels) being set up through the movie--Howard's looking at the second suit and saying ""someday..."" prepares us for War Machine, and the terrorist organization that captures Stark--the Ten Rings--is an obvious reference to The Mandarin...<br />  But this movie ultimately is made...because Jon Favreau knew more than the bloggers when it came to casting Tony Stark.  He went with Robert Downey Jr, and because of that, ""Iron Man"" works...<br />AND THEN SOME."
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	"Disc 1 - the movie.<br />I gave the movie only 3 stars.  I am a fan of the books, so it was inevitable that I was disappointed with the movie, but not for the reasons you might think.  Much was cut out, but that isn't what bothered me.  As the longest book in the series, it was a given that many things would be cut.  My main gripe is that the 5th movie installment didn't stay true to the story.  The other four movies managed to do that, despite all the subplots, etc that were left out.<br />First and foremost, this book is ALL about Harry's emotions; his frustration, his anger.  He is at the breaking point after years of being loved one minute and hated the next.  In the beginning, he is furious with Ron and Hermione, throughout the book he constantly battles with Umbridge, and at the end he explodes in Dumbledore's office.<br />He lands himself in detention with Umbridge several times because he just can't control his temper.  He struggles throughout the book with Dumbledore's apparent lack of caring.  He is worried about Sirius being locked up in Grimmauld Place, and he hates Snape for constantly antagonizing Sirius.  Harry begins to alienate himself from eveyone after the attack on Arthur Weasley because he think Voldemort might be possessing him.  None of this was portrayed adequately in the film, not to mention that he is both tormented and enthralled by the reoccuring dreams of the door to the department of mysteries.  All of these things lead up to Harry's explosion of rage in Dumbledore's office at the end.  It was not a quiet conversation.  Harry screams, yells, and smashes up the office.  He loses complete control and all his emotions come spilling out.  After which, Dumbledore proceeds to explain to Harry that it is all his fault, that he has known of the prophecy all along and that he should have told Harry sooner than he did.  He tells him that he was trying to protect him because he had come to care for Harry so much.  The true essence of that scene was lost in the film.<br />It just seems that directors are caving in to special effects and movie theatrics and losing sight of what the story is all about.<br /><br />*On the plus side, I did think Umbridge was very well cast and I thought the possession scene with Harry was really great!  There were a few good moments in the film.*<br /><br /> Disc 2 - special features.  I don't know what else to say except that they sucked!  The deleted scenes were nothing, just 20 second fillers.  I had hoped that there would be some really great scenes in there that they just didn't have time for.  The Tailing Tonks segment was terrible, didn't really show any of the behind the scenes operations in depth enough to give us any idea of how the movie was made.  There were no cast interviews, no explanation of script writing/changes - nothing.  It just seemed as though they had forgotten about the special features, so at the last minute they just threw a bunch of leftover stuff together.  It's my advice to not bother with the 2 disc special edition and just buy the movie itself.  It was a complete disappointment for those like me that love to watch ""the making of..."" featurettes."
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"""Signs"" was one of my favorite films of 2002. Likewise, ""The Sixth Sense"" was also excellent. This however, is not. I will say that the acting was good. The sad part is that the actors are largely wasted. The ending is horrible. Next time someone else should write the screenplay."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	We had heard clips of this and decided to purchase.  We all loved it.  This one is a bit more explicit than Insanity one and we enjoyed that a e a bit more. Worth the money!
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	This film plays all the exploitive cards:  it's gratuitously violent, its characters are stereotypes, it's jokes are vulgar, and its message celebrates hypocrisy.  The film is filled with anti-Irish cliches that seem intended to convince the new American masses that they too can survive by hook or crook.  If you value your time and money, spend it on a film that portrays the value of honest police work and the futility of gangsterism.
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	I expected to be entertained. Instead, I was bored to death!!! I love fantasy and horror, not horrible. The plot was scattered. The acting awful.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	Every movie becomes better and better.  The graphics are supreme, the story line is excellent. Each movie you see all the Hogswart students grow both in stature and in their knowledge of their particular art.<br />  Ms Rowling's technique in her writing leaves you craving for more and more never-ending. After you have been hooked with the Sorcerer Stone, and after you have finished devouring each novel, your left with a bittersweet knowledge that there are only so many stories to go before its over.<br />  What would it take for MS Rowling's to add a few more novels to the series, even though the characters will and have become adults???
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	"I finally caught this movie at a drive-in as part of a double feature. It is a fairly similar telling of the Snow White fairy tale; however, it has too many flaws:<br /><br />--Some of the background stories were vague and confusing.<br />--The Huntsman ""awakens"" Snow White and before she bites the apple she claims the prince is her ""true love"".<br />--Kristen at times acts well, but in some scenes she looks distant and uninteresting.<br />--The Huntsman is a lonely drunkard who longs to be with his dead wife, but instantly becomes sober and strong and in love with Snow White.<br />--The movie is very dark and cold.<br /><br />Because we were at a drive-in theater when we saw this movie, we ended up poking fun of it and talking instead of watching it."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	The DVD was in excellent condition upon delivery and it was delivered in a very timely manner, I actually didn't even expect as fast as it got here.  I was impressed with the whole process.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie is for all ages good story and superb picture.<br /><br />I watch it over and over.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"It is Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Withcraft and Wizardry, and things are about to go from bad to worse.  First, Harry and Dudley encounter a pair of dementors in Little Whinging, one of which almost manages to steal Dudley's soul.  Harry happens to have his wand on him, however, and repels both dementors using the Patronus charm.  That action causes him to get expelled from Hogwarts, but soon after, his expulsion is rescinded pending a trial hearing.  Mad-Eye and the rest of the Order come to break Harry out, and they head to the headquarters of the Order, formerly Sirius' childhood home.  From there, they speed onward to Hogwarts, where things are anything but how they've been.<br /><br />For starters, Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, is absolutely resolute in denying that Voldemort is back.  Also, he uses the incident with Harry's Patronus to place more and more Ministry restrictions on Hogwarts, starting with the appointment of one of Fudge's own subordinates, Senior Undersecretary Dolores Umbridge, as the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher.  Soon, under Umbridge's tutelage, DaDA becomes, not a place where magic is used, but a place where magic is taught, because, in the words of Umbridge, ""Who do you think would want to use magic against you out there?""  Not only that, but Umbridge (through Fudge) gets a whole load of Ministry Decrees passed, further tightening the Ministry's control over Hogwarts.<br /><br />A main part of the Order of the Phoenix movie is Harry's formation of Dumbledore's Army (DA).  Since Umbridge won't teach them defensive magic, Harry vows to do just that for anyone who is willing.  The DA originally consists of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, but soon a whole slew of other characters join, including Neville, who, up until this point, had been lacking in the magical abilities department.  Also, Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape are included here, as is Voldemort's attempts to get into Harry's mind using Legilimency.  Finally, the Battle at the Ministry, where Voldemort finally reveals himself to the Ministry and the remainder of the Order.<br /><br />As my title says, Order of the Phoenix is the best movie out of the five that have been released, but I have a few big problems with how they handled the transition from book to movie, the main one being time.  How can they justify taking the longest Harry Potter book yet and making into the shortest Harry Potter movie yet?  Many crucial scenes were cut out, including (not really crucial, but certainly enjoyable) Ron's Quidditch tryouts (and Quidditch in general is cut completely out), Harry and the gang's meeting with Neville and his Crucio-ed mother in St. Mungo's during Christmas break, Dumbledore's conversation with Harry at the end was cut by about 3/4, Harry's excursion into Snape's memory changed (in the book, he found out about his father's torturing Snape through the Pensieve, but in the movie, it's when Harry Protegos Snape's Legilimens spell)... I realize time constraints are a factor, but cutting an 870-page book down to a mere 2 and 1/2 hour movie is beyond me.<br /><br />In spite of the completely unsatisfactory length, I was very much satisfied with the actor choices for the new parts.  Coming in for her first ever movie role is the beautiful Evanna Lynch, who plays the eccentric Luna Lovegood.  Personally, Evanna is the best actor in the whole movie, not to mention my favorite actress; she really captures the personality of Luna very well.  Gary Oldman returns for his second stab at the character of Sirius Black, and pulls off a very convincing performance.  Michael Gambon is at his best this film, as he plays Dumbledore's character to a tee.  Another actress making her first Harry Potter movie debut is Helena Bonham Carter, who plays the demented Bellatrix Lestrange; Imelda Staunton performs admirably as Professor Dolores Umbridge, the most hated character in the movie; and finally... returning for his fifth time is Alan Rickman, who once again shows the world that there can only be one true Severus Snape, and that is he.<br /><br />Also, character development is a key part that OotP and director David Yates pull off spectacularly.  We see Neville, who before couldn't do as much as a Disarming Spell, grow into quite the formidable wizard, even attempting to battle Bellatrix when they meet in the Ministry.  We see Hermione... okay, so no real change occurs in Hermione; she's still the brave know-it-all, except this time around, she's more accepting of breaking the rules (leading to Ron's classic line ""Who are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?""). And then there's Ron, who, unfortunately, is pretty much shunted to the back in favor of Hermione's more affable personality; his biggest scene (not including the battle scene) is his defending of Harry when Seamus rips him for believing that Voldemort is back.  Finally, Luna really gets her time in the spotlight, being one of the first to master Harry's teaching the Patronus spell; also, her relationship with Harry deepens alot (does anyone else besides me think that Luna's got a HUGE crush on Harry?) and she starts making friends with Ron and Hermione a bit more, too.<br /><br />To close... the innumerable omissions may irk many a die-hard Harry Potter fan, but don't let that discourage you from going to see Order of the Phoenix.  It's still the best Harry Potter movie to date- it just could have been a little bit longer and, by extension, a little bit better."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Food, Inc. very interesting and informative. I am sharing this with everyone I know. The response is always the same WOW !!! It has given my husband and I a lot to think about, and watch out for. My husband is now on the corn feed beef look out. I personally don't eat much beef, so I am glad for the help to promote a healthier choice. Getting the word out is what is needed. The television media has only focused on certain areas, and left out much of the background that is the reasons behind the problems we now have. Clearly the large corporations need to take more responsibility for what has happened, and is still happening. Yes we, as individuals have to make the right choices and be responsible about it. For many people, they can only trust on the food that is offered at a reasonable cost to feed their family and hope that it is healthy food. Many people don't realize just how much fillers they are getting instead of healthy food. Thanks for helping to get the word out.

B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"I was very satisfied with this!!!!!:D<br /><br />First of all I decided to Buy the ""Blu-ray/DVD+Digital Copy"" pack cause even though I only can play the DVD right now. When I get a Blu-ray player I will already have Blu-ray and not have to re-buy all my movies.<br /><br />Let me say I did not buy this from Amazon..I bought it from target when it was on sale. Never the less this ia a GREAT BUY!<br /><br />this combo pack comes with three(3) discs. the first on is the actual Movie on BLU-RAY the second disc is a BLU-RAY disc of BONUS FEATURES(ones such as the maximum movie mode and etc.) the 3rd and final disc is a DVD of the movie.(NOTE: the DVD Does NOT include ANY bonus features. It is just the movie it's self)<br /><br />Since I do not have a Blu-rya player I cannot comment on the blu-ray disc(s),But I'm sure they are wonderful!<br /><br />a couple days after I bought it I went of to my cousin's house for the evening to watch the movie. we watched it on their ig screen TV(the older ""projection"" kind with the fat back) and the DVD's quality was pretty good on it. then just last night we played it on our own HD plasma TV(720p) tv and it looked even better!!! I don't know what people are saying about it being horribly dark. the movie is dark,cause it takes place mostly at night. but the colors where some of the best I've seen!!!<br /><br />as for the movie it's self,I think this is one of the best HPs!!!I really liked it cause the trio really got to show how good they can act and there was a lot of emotion and really good dialogue.<br /><br />so,I would recommend this movie and combo pack to anyone who wants to own both the Blu-ray and DVD and get the Digital copy as an added bonus!<br /><br />I would also like to note that the Blu-ray ""packaging"" is really good and solid..really feels nice in the hands and doesn't feellike it would easily break."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This series is truly additive. It leaves you hanging and desiring more at the end of each episode. I enjoyed how the created or writers have identified Vampires weakness and strengths. If you haven't seen the first season it is well worth the money if you enjoy vampires cliff hangers. This season was an excellent series to follow to watch and enjoy. If you don't mind nudity and foul language this is a excellent series to purchase.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I bought this item for my cousin for Christmas...it arrived in a timely manner. It was in the exact condition specified by the merchant. I was very happy with this purchase. Thanks.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	My family loves this movie in 3-D.  If you think it's effects were good just wait until you see it in 3-D....well worth it!
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	Maybe I missed something by not seeing this in the theater; maybe the living comic book visual style of SIN CITY was so dazzling on a big screen that it obliterated any reservations about the sheer banality of its storylines. But I finally got a chance to see this film, a joint effort of graphic novelist Frank Miller and film director Robert Rodriguez, and was frankly bored by it after about half an hour (and I think I'm being generous there!). All the storylines---Bruce Willis' attempt to protect a young stripper (Jessica Alba), Mickey Rourke's attempt to avenge a prostitute's (Jaime King) death, Clive Owen's attempt to put down a thug (Benicio del Toro) and his misogynistic ways---are done in a film noir style that is unfortunately ALL style. There's no psychological depth to any of the characters as there are in other comic book adaptations (BATMAN BEGINS is an exemplary recent example); it's all just a soulless geek show. A fantastic looking, often atmospheric geek show, but a geek show nevertheless. If appearances are all that matter to you, than SIN CITY will probably be a ball (and the visuals are the only reasons I'm giving the movie 2 stars instead of just 1). But for those looking for something other than just fancy-pants visuals in a comic book movie adaptation, look elsewhere.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham is a wonderful commedian and ventriloquist.  Sure, you're probably saying ""great, a ventriloquist.""  What ever you may have thought of ventriloquists in the past, you can just forget.  Jeff brings his ""kids"" to life and you forget that he's doing the voices.  The title says it all and he really does get in hilarious arguments with the characters.  Walter, Peanut, and everyone else will keep you laughing until your sides split.  I watch this DVD over and over because it is so fresh that even when you know the punchline, you will still laugh."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Great buy! My son loves it! He plays every day with Matter and McQueen, it is true they are not the best quality, it's hard plastic, but they are holding so far...
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I love the Polar Express movie, and seeing it in 3-D is triple the wonder! The third dimension just adds to the dream-like quality of this wonderful story. I watched it in August and even in the non-Christmas season enjoyed it thoroughly for the artistic scenes and delightful action that pops off the television screen. I highly recommend this 3-D experience for all ages! It is beautifully produced.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie, but with such a big cast I really could not refuse the temptation to see why so many big names would sign on. The movie opened simply, but I know from minute one that it was going to be a blast. The violence was so intense, but somehow not overpowering, at least not most of it. There were a few scenes that made me cringe; however, these were necessary to the power of the film. Having never read the books (although I hear that the movie is a mirror copy) I was a little shocked. I have seen worse, but this was coming from a ""Comic book..."" oh well. I loved the cast. Willis, Rourke, Alba, Dawson, Owen, and even Hartnett, Murphy, and Wood played it cool. I was also glad to see the emergence of some new faces, who actually got good air time! These included _2 Fast 2 Furious's_  Devon Aoki as the unconquerable Miho and the beautiful and extremely talented _Gilmore Girl_  Alexis Bledel as Becky, the backstabbing prostitute.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is unbeatable, the use of color is wild and brilliant; it accentuates the drama and gore to an extreme - bringing the characters to life. And yes, it is true, the majority of the women are hookers in this film, but they are far from helpless. I would recommend this movie to anyone old enough (and with an open enough mind) to comprehend the beauty in the madness. It takes formidable jabs at the hypocrisy that plagues the Church and the police, while glorifying the everyday, flawed, hero. It applauds loyalty and loathes treachery - important in a workable society. The more I think about this film, the more I think it may be - dare I say - Inspirational."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This movie was so funny I thought i was going to wet myself. I loved it.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	My kids 14+ up love this DVD. We originally saw it on HBO and I purchased it for them. It can't be completely billed a G rated humor but it is pretty close... nice family fun. Jeff is a complete ventroliquist pro! He accomplishes some amazing things here! Enjoy!
B00447G29S	4.0	b	Enchanting. Innocent. Adorable. Instills Hope. Charming. Lovely. Interesting. Lulling. A Rarity. Christmastime. Expanding. Adventure. Like-able. Tempting. Engulfing. Young-at-heart. Snow is everywhere. &lt;3.<br /><br />4.2 stars.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"I had tears in my eyes, I was laughing so hard!  Absolutely great to have around the house as something to watch with others.  And, they even have it so you can do the ""bleeped"" version, should there be kids around."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"Staring Ben Stein in eXpelled<br />""I love this movie!"" Ben Stein<br /><br />What an asshat!!<br /><br />. . .<br /><br />IDiots...<br /><br />Do you believe there is variation within populations?<br />Do you believe some of these variants are better at surviving then others?<br />Do you believe there is heredity between generations?<br /><br />Congratulations, you believe in evolution!

B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I admit that I avoided it in the theatre.  Partially because I was annoyed that Pixar was bought out by Disney and the fact my girl is noise sensitive and would have gotten upset over the race scenes and the noise involved.<br /><br />While getting a haircut for her, they had it playing.  I decided to buy it after she was done.<br /><br />As typical to Pixar it's a great story about about a self absorbed up and coming race car named Lightning McQueen (named after Steve McQueen).<br /><br />Lightning thinks he can do everything by himself and it comes back on him as he ignores advice and ends up in a 3-way tie in a race he should have won.  He has to head out to California for a race off between the 3 winners and eventually gets lost and ends up on the forgotten roads of Route 66.  He panics and ends up destroying the streets of the forgotten town of Radiator Springs.  He is caught and his punishment is to repair the roads.<br /><br />There he finds many characters.  Doc Hudson (Paul Neuman) who may have a secret past, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) the simple happy go lucky tow truck, and of course a nice Girl Porsche Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) who is a dreamer and longs for what the town used to be.<br /><br />Along the way Lightning makes friends with the town people.  Mater being the best friend.  He helps the improve itself and they help him start thinking about other people.<br /><br />The movie has a well rounded cast with the efforts of Tony Shalhoub, Cheeh marin, John Ratzenburger, Michel Keaton, George Carlin, and cameos by others.<br /><br />There are two shorts, One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight.  I lost count on how many times my girl had to watch them!<br /><br />There are deleted scenes which are drawing form.<br /><br />There is a short by John Lasseter called Inspiration For Cars.  He takes you on a trip on Route 66 and you can see where stuff came from in the movie!  You even get to meet the real life Mater!<br /><br />I am happy with this purchase and I HOPE Disney leaves them alone!
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	It is rare these days for a movie to both entertain and make one think. Not only were the visuals stunning, the plot was interesting even if it was just another take on the ancient astronaut theory and the special effects were remarkable. I was expecting another crappy, mindless alien movie with nothing but a bunch of predictable mindless beasts lurking in the shadows waiting to pounce. I think a lot of nerdy fanboys got butthurt because it didn't turn out to be just that. Aliens have been done to death, brought back as a zombie and then done to death again and then some. I find it humorous that fanboys think the Alien films were wonderful and without plot holes and inconsistencies. The same basement dwelling virgins that have posters of Bladerunner on their walls forget that that film was also ripped to shreds by their ilk when it first came out. It wasn't until the director's cut came out and a few years had passed that it became a respected sci-fi classic. Fanboys are a lazy lot, want only mindless, nonstop action and just don't want to think. They want everything spoon-fed to them on a silver platter with nothing left to the imagination. Nerd fanboys are ruining chances of more great sci-fi movies being made because producers know fanboy losers will hang out in their darkened rooms and pick the movie to shreds frame by frame so they can go online and tear it a part in a vain attempt to sound smart when it just makes them look pathetic. And when the day comes that the only movies being made are stupid rom-coms and cheesy disney flicks the butt-hurt nerds will complain to no end but they'll have no one to blame but themselves that producers won't want to make anymore sci-fi flicks. I really hope they make a sequel because the engineer universe can be expanded upon whereas the alien universe is dead. So if you're a pretentious fanboy, don't watch this film, watch the alien movies that have already been made because they're all the same and there is nothing new to add to the alien universe because aliens are just mindless beasts fought by undeveloped characters with big guns that nobody cares about.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I'm sure there were some liberties taken (pardon the pun) when shooting this movie, but I thought it was excellently done.  The acting was terrific; Paul Giammati and Larua Linley did great character acting as John and Abigail Adams; they deserve Emmy awards for their performances.  The supporting cast was terrific.  I reccommend this highly.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	this is a great movie great actors great plot action from beginning toend I think everyone should watch it at least once I watched it twice in one week
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"Adapted from a classic children's book written by Chris Van Allsburg to the screen using computerized technology about a train ride to the North Pole, an expensive process but well worth the visual effects.  This was a complete Tom Hanks film using software to match his voice and mannerisms to many varied roles.  I liked him best as the conductor who punched letters into the children's tickets, return punches would complete a word -- each different to match their personalities and needs.<br /><br />There is a lovely snow scene in Grand Rapids, Michigan, at 11 p.m. on Christmas Eve when the mysterious steam engine arrived in the boy's own front yard with effects (shaking and noise) similar to an earthquake.  A skeptic about the validity of Santa Claus, he'd already looked in the World Book encyclopedia to read about the North Pole never thinking he'd travel there in less than an hour.  The boy was a lot like Brett (age 9) as he watched the mechanical Santa in a store window as the train went past.<br /><br />It is a magic train, all alight in several cars but the children, dressed in sleepware, sat in one car except for Billy.  A sad little boy who'd never received Christmas gifts, he sat by himself in the caboose.<br /><br />There were tapdancing waiters who served refreshments.  The hot chocolate left a brown mustache (like the while 'milk' one) on each child.  A lost ticket, swirling in the wind, lands amid a wolf pack; with the help of a bald eagle, it magically found its way back inside the train.<br /><br />That's only the beginning.  Boy discovers the hobo who calls himself the 'king of the train' on top of a coach car and they ski (cross-country style) to the engine where he jumps into the coal car.  He thought he was asleep and dreaming in the swirling snow.<br /><br />The hobo imprints on his mind that 'seeing is believing.'  But after a harrowing escape from the breaking ice after the train jackknives and slithers to safety, he learns that 'sometimes the most real things in the world are those we cannot see.'<br /><br />Inside the cab of the locomotive, he blows the whistle, and the train has to stop as deer are all over the tracks.  It seems that the engineer could talk Karibo when his long red hair is pulled.  Both engineers were comical characters as played by Michael Jeter.<br /><br />The music was magnificent as they take a wild ride down the mountain like a roller coaster.  We witness optical illusions with the Northern Lights at the Arctic Circle.  The tramp turns out to be a puppeteer with a marionette of Scrooge (bah, humbug), both patterned after Tom Hanks.<br /><br />At the North Pole, we see a lighted Christmas tree even taller than our National tree in Washington, D.C. or that at Rockefeller Center in New York City.  Three children are separated from the group and endure another wild ride on the curvy tracks around this city of lights in the runaway caboose.<br /><br />There appears to Boy a ghost of the hobo offering a nice hot 'cup of Joe' before they are stranded on a train turntable.  After a perilous walk to the tunnel, they find Santa's workshop in a cul-de-sac (dead end).<br /><br />The lost children had adventures galore in the inner workings of the labyrinth and see all the 'good of Christmas.'  If you see only one Christmas movie this year, let this be it.  A delight for the whole family, it can't be beat for having Christmas spirit -- plus appropriate music.<br /><br />Bing Crosby's version of 'White Christmas' is playing as the mountain of gifts is lifted from an open observatory like Kitt Peak in Arizona and floated over the lighted city in a hot air balloon.  The 'flying eleves' (""kids, do not try this at home,"" directed the conductor) sky-dived as the enormous bundle is loaded onto Santa's sleigh.  It takes some bungie-jumping to put the star on the tall tree.<br /><br />As long trumpets herald the arrival of St. Nick, the prancing reindeer are a sight to behold.  It's as if we were in the Land of Oz with all the munchkins.  Santa's blue eyes were like those I remarked on recently when I talked with a 'Victorian Santa' at the East Tennessee History Center.<br /><br />Santa explains his gifts: first, you must 'believe'; one child received a 'smidgin of humility'; another, ""no greater gift than friendship.""  He tells everyone that ""the true spirit of Christmas is in your heart.""  His fiber-optic reindeer whip made the tall tree magical.<br /><br />The Polar Express returns and they leave the city of lights as they head for home amid thick snow flakes and sparkling icycles.  The children are told that ""it doesn't matter where a train is going; what matters is to decide to get on.""  Under the tree on Christmas morning is an old fashioned truck toy (which dates the story) and a harlequin doll like the one I have for Eric, age 4.  Santa had gift-wrapped and delivered his special present, The Christmas Bell.<br /><br />Our local excursion train, the Rambler, is taking a Polar Express this Christmas on its regular route with readings of this book as special entertainment.  A giant step (I've been on these trips at different times of the Spring, Summer and Fall.), but this time it's 'reservation only.'<br /><br />Completed in only 56 days as a result of the computer technology (rapid progress), I predict this will become a classic like Burl Ives' 'Frosty the Snowman' and 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.'  An uplifting story."

B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	If you liked it before, and have a decent HD-setup, this DVD really shines!  Will be loved by both adults and kids alike.  Truely a Classic.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Let me being by saying HBO has become experts at re-creating past eras and making them into valuable and entertaining shows. That is why when I purchased John Adams I expected nothing less than the reputation they had already instilled in me from previous experiences.<br /><br />John Adams, while some may not be 100% accurate, is informative and intriguing. I loved Thomas Jefferson in the mini series because he was intriguing and quite mysterious. Paul Giamatti plays John excellent as well and I am so happy I made this purchase. This is worth all the money and I am positive I will watch this countless times!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"This has got to be the funniest thig I have watched in years.  Jeff Dunham is a NUT, and darn good at being one.  I highly recommenr this DVD to everyone!  There is a ""bleeped"" and an ""unbleeped"" version, so this can fun for the whole family!  Buy it today!"
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	...someone had told me before I walked into the imax that it was a b horror movie, a mere prequel to aliens.  I would have enjoy it much more.  Instead i was told by the ticket guy that it was very scientific with a provocative story, and that he couldn't wait to see it again.  Aside from that, my fundamental issue with the movie is that a corporation would pay so much money to send a bunch of idiots to a distant planet.  Those so called scientists and professionals were extremely...  unprofessional.  Oh, let's take off our helmets!  There's oxygen!  It was really tantamount to sending a bunch of actors to a distant planet to do scientific research (which they did :-).  It didn't have to be so completely dumbed down.  Filming making has long since surpassed good story writing, and it's a little pathetic.  So much resources and money go into the dumbest things these days.  That said, I adore michael fassenbender.  Also well done on the visual experience.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	Just fifteen minutes into this film I realized how bad it was-Ford  acting stiffly when his stunt double or CGI twin isn't running around like a cartoon character; ugly, visually obnoxious looking color photography in dim lighting; bad acting straight from a Ed Woods film.
B001KEGR8Y	1.0	b	Skip this and watch something with some real humor. His opening act was completely boring and I didn't find anything amusing in the first 10 minutes. Was also surprised how many f-bombs were in here that he could have done without.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	Why did they have to have aliens in this series. There are hundreds of great unsolved mysteries of the world that could have made a better story. Southparks portrayal of this movie best describes this movie. Beware Indiana Jones fans. Don't taint your eyes
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Gotta love truth-tellers. This movie allowed for the viewer to make up their own mind, while exposing the deep bias within the scientific community. Scientists should have the freedom to pursue facts unfettered by politics and culture. Stein does a wonderful, entertaining and thought-provoking job at inviting the audience into the history and current state of affairs within the scientific community. Reminds me of the Church in the dark-ages, power brokers ostracizing people not towing the party line.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	When Cars first came out on DVD, I was a little disappointed because there weren't very many extras on it.  I didn't understand why Pixar would take one of their most popular films and give it such a mediocre treatment.  Well.....now that I have the Blu-ray version of this film, I think I know why.  They were saving it all for Cars debut on hi-def.  This has to be the best looking picture I have seen yet on a hi-def title.  I looks almost like the entire film is in 3-D!!!  I managed to catch part of this movie on a hi-def cable channel and thought I would compare the two pictures.  After a little fiddling, I managed to get both screens at the exact same frame, and was blown away at how much clearer the Blu-ray picture is.  The Cine-Explore feature on this is the best special feature I've seen on a hi-def title.  It is almost sensory overload at the amount of material that continuously pops up across the screen while the film is playing.  This disc will be the one I will pop in to show my friends what Blu-ray is capable of doing.  Every Blu-ray owner needs to get this title.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	If you haven't really read enough about the Evolution vs Creationism conflict in America to have a strong opinion, or if you're sitting on the fence then you must see this film.  The nonsensical propaganda that Stein spouts will make you realize how phony creationism is.  On the other hand if Stein convinces you he speaks the truth, well then don't worry you have bigger problems in life, like tying your shoes and counting to numbers above 10.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	For some reason, it took me about six months to watch this movie. When I finally did, it was way more than I expected. RDJr isn't my favorite actor, but he was perfect for this role. Paltrow played hers well, and Jeff Bridges really surprised me. One of my go-to movies on Blu-ray from now on. One of the best combinations of story, action and SFX I know of.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Everyone I've shared Spark of Insanity with absolutely LOVED it.  Jeff Dunham's interpretation of the world enhanced mine.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	I'm a die hard fan of Scott's Alien (and Aliens).  When I heard David Lindelof (of the TV show Lost) was chosen to finish the script I admittedly cringed a little.  He's a superb writer but I am not always a fan of his style.<br /><br />I understand the criticisms lodged at the movie/writers/actors and I don't think they are all unwarranted.  O'Bannon's script for Alien was so tight.  It was his baby and it came long before Scott and Giger came aboard for the project. Plus, the acting was flawless.<br /><br />Scott and Lindelof said repeatedly that this was NOT a prequel to Alien.  Scott wanted to take the motifs/themes and go in a different direction.  I think the theme was lofty (the origins of humanity) and fell flat with some viewers.  The plot twists and subplots were difficult to accept or believe at times.  You have to understand that's Lindelhof's approach, not the absence of any creativity per se.<br />There are some intelligent interpretations of the film on youtube worth watching.<br /><br />Still, if you are an Alien filmology fan, this is a must.  I think we will learn to like the film more over time.  Besides, what else do we have to rent?  Space Cowboys?
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	Jeff Dunham is very talented and funny!  I am in love with Walter and Peanut!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	If mass-produced movies make you gag, standout No Country will go down easily.<br /><br />This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel won an Oscar for Best Picture.  To those who had seen the movie, that came as no surprise.<br /><br />What makes No Country so captivating is the moral dilemma posed at every turn.  The very human characters must choose between not just the typical good atd evil, but between hubris and resignation, between money and love, and between trust and going it alone.  The often-bloody consequences of these choices force the viewer into a stunned silence as he or she evaluates what is really most important in life.<br /><br />Unless you can't stand violence, there is no reason not to see this movie.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I will start this off by saying you must be insane to insanity. I worked out everyday, and I never get pain like I do when I push the play button insanity. Don't get me wrong, it awesome but please beware your joints and ligaments. Get ready to take a bath in WD-40 after you start this ;-) Did I mention it's AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	The package arrived on the first estimated delivery date. The seller responded to my inquiry regarding the product's tracking number promptly and enthusiastically. Overall no problems with product or seller. I would purchase from them again. Insanity workout is intense. Takes a lot of motivation, requires no equipment, and yeilds good results. I would recommend it if you are looking for a change in your body or are bored with your workout routine. Just as a side note, it maybe be a little tough on the knees, but fish oil supplements take care or the pain.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"Movie was fantastic, and frankly better than all of the other Alien movies by a mile, perhaps with the exception of the original.  The 3D was fantastic.<br /><br />I love how people complain about ""unrealistic"" things in sci-fi movies.  Don't listen to the haters."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I read the John Adams book by David McCullough first.  I enjoyed the book very much and was eager to see how it translated to television.  I have really enjoyed the way the mini-series has been able to capture the book.<br />The series and the book helps me to realize how amazing our founding fathers were and how they were all such visionaries.  Every American should either see the series or read the book to either re-capture their sense of patriotism, or experience it for the first time.  Our forefathers and their families made many sacrifices for us to be able to live in the United States.  We should never forget how fortunate we all are to be born in this country.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"The entire concept of ""Expelled!"" is that academics who try to promote Intelligent Design are irrevocably harmed, as if some monumental inquisition is at work in academia.  The only problem with this is it flat out isn't true.<br /><br />Among the examples used in the film are Richard Sternberg (an unpaid intern at the Smithsonian, not an employee, and a paid employee at the NIH) who had given notice of his resignation to the Smithsonian six months before the article that caused him to be ""terrorized"" was published.  His employment at the NIH continued unchanged.  So his claims that his life was ""nearly ruined"" are really based on him having nothing really happen to him at all.<br /><br />Guillermo Gonzalez was denied tenure at Iowa State.  The film attributes this to Gonzalez's support of ID.  According to ISU, Gonzalez was denied tenure based on a review of his publications, his success in attracting research funding, the graduate students he had supervices, and his overall future promise in the field.  This looks only at his work at ISU, not before.  Unfortunately for Gonzalez, his publications appear to be restatements of prior work and that his original research slowed down considerably.  Also, the department that Gonzalez was looking for tenure in had a history of rejecting candidates at a much higher level than the university as a whole, something that the film clearly ignored since they only examined university-wide tenure stats.  His work bringing in research also paled in comparison to the average tendured faculty in his department at ISU as analyzed by scientists examing his claims of mistreatment.<br /><br />You could go on in this way for all of the ""expelled"" subjects.<br /><br />So what you really have here is a ""theory"" of Intelligent Design intended to create a controversy where none really exists in science, and a movie trying to claim an anti-religious agenda that ""expells"" those who dare examine the controversy when no one is really expelled."
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"Oh brother.  The trailer(s) for this film have been EVERYWHERE for, oh, about two years now.  Billed as a ""prequel"" to the infamous ""Alien"" franchise, Prometheus had very bill shoes to fill from the get go.  There's been a ""Making Of"" on HBO, where Ridley Scott toots his own horn about this movie.  I would like to ask him if it was his plan to make a movie that would bore people to death?  If that's the case, he succeeded.<br /><br />""Prometheus"" is the name of a spaceship that sets out to investigate alien forms--I guess.  We first see David the Android, played by Michael Fassbender.  He's preparing everyone for wakeup call.  His portrayl was spot-on; however, his character is played without emotion, so what's there to care about him?  Charlize Theron plays Meredith Vickers, who is involved with the company that wants this research or the alien life form.  She usually looks like she's just been hit in the head with a brick, but at least she doesn't chew on the scenery like she did in ""Snow White and the Huntsman.""  When the crew arrives at its destination, Noomi Rapace (playing Liz Shaw) and her boyfriend/lover find some sort of ""temple,"" and they're off to see the Wizard.<br /><br />I saw this movie in a packed theater the day after it opened.  I cannot tell you how much pain I was in just trying to keep myself AWAKE.  For a movie that lasts over two hours, it sure was short on action.  And there's a scene in which Liz Shaw does her own c-section, which was just TOTALLY unbelievable.  I don't care if the movie was set a billion years from now; talk to ANY woman that's had a c-section.  Ask her if she could be on her feet, running five minutes after the procedure.  If that was meant to shock, it didn't.  The ending (did it really have one?) was also laugh-outload funny; so contrived; so nonbelievable.<br /><br />If Ridley Scott or any of his cronies thinks they've created the next science fiction masterpiece, they'd better think again.  Not only did this movie NEVER live up to its billing, it never comes close to the action and story in either ""Alien"" or ""Aliens.""  Both those movies were talked about for quite sometime because they told a great story, the acting was great, and the aliens gave everyone the willies.  This movie is another shining example of saturating the market for years with trailers, know you'll make decent bank on opening, but then watching your film appear on pay-per-view in no time at all."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"When people go into a movie theatre they expect to be entertained. Audiences want to be scared, amused, curious, sad, and hopefull. Believe it or not, this film provides all of those elements and then some. I've read the comments by people who gave passed this film on as either ""too scary to children"" or ""just plain boring with no plot"" And I agree with several people who have responded to such comments.<br /><br />This film isn't going to give you instant gratification halfway through. If you don't have two hours to spare then you aren't going to understand what this movie is about. Sure the plot was invisible at times, but I don't think the point of the movie was to have the audience follow a plot. The point was to reveal or in some cases remind people of the simplistic faith or child like view we once had in our lives.<br /><br />Think of the characters themselves and what they represent. Hero Boy reminds us of people who are caught in between faith and doubt. Do we trust what we cannot see? Who is to say? Hero Girl shows the stronger side of faith and believing in what is not readily seen to the human eye. Childlke faith personified into a little girl. Lonely Boy represent those who doubt because they haven't truly experienced the joys of life or  have had tragedies happen to them from an early age so they learn to only trust themselves, but that ends up leaving them...lonely. Then are those who are the Know-It-All character who claim to take everything at face value (much like the critics and cynics of this film).  They want to know it all because what they don't know scares them.<br /><br />I'm 21 years old and I haven't had nearly enough experiences in life, but I can say that I had been so busy growing up that I had forgotten that there was a part of me that was once simple, happy and appreciated the joys of just believing that things were true. That is until life makes you grow up and tries to distort your beliefs (much like HoboMan in this film).<br /><br />When I first saw this movie my eyes widened with every new frame. It was the first time since my childhood that I can remember sitting in the audience with my mouth open and my eyes stretched out as far as they can be. I was stunned, by the artistry and complexity of the story. I was a kid again for two hours. It was like an old friend who I hadn't seen in a long time came back to visit. It was an amazing film.<br /><br />It's a train ride, a leap of faith, a test of the human spirit. It's a ride and like the movie says: ""It's not about where the train takes you, what matters is that you get on."" THAT, my friend, is what this movie is about. Not being entertained by slapstick humor or satirical sarcasm, but remembering that part of you that resembles the kids in the movie. Believe.<br /><br />Bravo on a fantastic film."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Awesome! love having this installment of the harry potter saga!!! Excellent purchase and very happy with it! A great price as well, thanks
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	The movie was very entertaining, but personally, I'd like to see more interaction in place of the endless action, to breathe some life into the genre.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	My son had to pause the show when I laughed so hard I clutched my side and ran to the bathroom<br />Jeff is a character himself<br />Love it!
B001KZG99A	1.0	b	Now that I have begun collecting blu ray I can realize if it is a fake or not and the Iron Man copy is a duplicate. thanks to Sony Database the information automatically generates when you play plus I noticed it stated BR - D not BR-Rom and there was no menu options. If I was going to buy a bootlegg I would have played a lot less but blu ray has so many heatures like online and hope no one buys anything from them because there misleading.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot is horrible, mixing russians and aliens into a confusing soup. There isn't a single action-scene with a hint of realism in this movie.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! tHE DIRECTOR HAS OUTDONE HIMSELF.  iT HAD TWISTS (not those lame ones you see coming)and turns THAT KEEP YOU INTERESTED.  IT HAS ACTION, COMEDY,DRAMA, AND WELL DONE BOSTON ACCENTS! CHEERS TO MATT DAMON AND LEO FOR DOING THEM SO WELL.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	This is an engaging look at John Adams and his interactions with the other Founding Fathers. It follows what was written in the book Founding Brothers almost exactly though, so if you have recently read it then the story becomes a little repetitive.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Director David Yates has done it yet again with the seventh installment in this incredible fantasy series. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are now out in the world on their own, tracking down the seven deadly Horcruxes, and nowhere is safe. I love the new cast additions (including Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood, Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour, Nick Moran as Scabior, etc.), the cinematography, the score, and the faithfulness to the exciting book its based on. I would definitely say this is the best, darkest and most thrilling Potter yet; a recommendation goes without saying. I cannot wait for the final installment this summer.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Product arrived as advertised; brand new factory wrapped. First rate customer service. Jeff Dunham is very funny and talented. I enjoy sharing these DVDs with fanily and friends.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	the information presented is irrefutable.  Mr. Stein explains thing clearly and easily understood.  Any one who questions creation vs. evolution needs to see this!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Excellent story line, great for all couples married or not.  I recommend couples that are having problem to watch movie.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	I saw this movie for the first time this year.  Watched it with my wife and 3-year-old son who couldn't take his eyes off it.  The annimation is amazing.  If I'd watched it in 3-D, I would have fallen out of my chair.  I bought the video so we can watch it every year as a family... along with Wizard of Oz and It' a Wonderful Life.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	I enjoyed the movie, however I have to admit I liked the book better. In all honestly this is the first time I can say that. I was hoping because the book was being divided into two it would closer resemble the book and that did ot hapen. It was still a very good movie that really moved, it was interesting from the beginning
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	How my ratings work:<br />5 - I really liked/loved it<br />4 - I liked it<br />3 - Could've been better/worth a look<br />2 - Just didn't live up to the potential<br />1 - Simply awful<br /><br />Was this the movie that Scorsese desearved the best director Oscar for? Some say yes, others say no. Personally I think Raging Bull and Goodfellas are the movies he should've won for. But I'm not gonna complain because the Academy finally recognized Scorsese. After 27 years of being nominated, he finally got the award he desearved. Not that he needed an oscar to prove his worth in the movie world. Scorsese is by far the one of the best directors of any generation. But this movie is still worth a watch. It's a rivetting tale of murder, deceit, and betrayel. Everyone gives it their all. Leonardo Di Caprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Whalberg are all at the top of their game here. I don't really need to go into the plot details, there are plenty of other reviews on here that will do that for you.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"In order to appreciate this particular movie you must have a healthy appetite for straight-up gratuitous violence, because this is a one-course meal.  The plot was weak, the premise was depressingly dark; after the initial killings suspense pretty much disappeared, because there was no surprise in anything that followed.  Gorey?  Yes.  Dark to the point of hopeless?  Yes.  If the theme was intended to be the age-old ""Good vs Evil"", well, the point was driven home ad nauseum, and, well, let's just say Good looks pretty outmatched. All the way through to the end.  I felt I was watching a documentary on execution-type murders.  Ho-hum.<br /><br />Academy Award winner... they must have been watching a different movie."
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	One strange movie but not boring.<br />As a mother/grandmother, I'd lock this one away from the kids.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	Fantastic casting of Downey as the billionaire industrialist cynical hero, and his mentor mentor Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), as the evil corporate titan profiteering from other people's suffering. (I know it's horribly cliche, but he pulls it off well).<br /><br />Brilliant plot and more crucially the writing, which offers interest for both the children and the adults, despite being a a comic book hero. Special effects carry the plot along nicely. Recommended to keep around when there's a house full of kids and bored parents sipping hidden scotch.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	The standard definition disc looked very good and the Blue Ray disc takes it to a new place.  Great story, animation and location (love that whole South West look).  What will they think of next?
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Most all if the cool forest scenes were shown in the preview which was a little disappointing - movie was not as good as I thought<br />It would be
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"My  6 year-old son is a HUGE train lover.  The Polar Express is one of his favorite movies of all time.  We owned a toddler version of the book, we own the actual book, we own the DVD, the 3D version of the DVD, and now the Blu Ray 3D version.  Blu Ray 3D blows them all away.<br /><br />The story, about a boy struggling to believe in Santa, is a wonderful journey to the North Pole.  Seeing it in real 3D for the first time was like actually BEING on the train!  I gasped when the train pulled up to the house, it was that incredible (and this from someone who has seen the film dozens of times!)<br /><br />Since Amazon seems to aggregate all reviews under each version, if you own a 3d capable blu ray player and television, please look for the version that says Single Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo.  There is another ""3D"" version of the film that comes with the old school blue and red glasses - this is NOT what you want.  Trust."
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	When I heard that Ridley Scott was doing a prequel to his original Alien, I knew that I would not be disappointed.  What a great film this was regarding the epic story which fits in very well within the Alien universe.  The actors did an amazing job with the characters they portrayed, they give off a very convincing performance which makes you care about what happens to them.  The 3-D effects were the best that I have ever seen.  Usually I don't like 3D in movies, but paying a little extra for the 3-D in Prometheus was well worth it.  Ridley Scott really knew what he was doing regarding the likable characters, epic story, and grand scale of effects which makes this film a classic.  I don't understand why some people nitpick every little detail in this movie. It's a great film/Alien prequel and I highly recommend that you see it.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	this was a great movie<br />a movie the whole family would like<br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was my favorite<br />alot of action
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This is a nice package for a film such as this.  My only wish, is that it would contain more interviews with Frank Miller and how he brought Sin City to life as a comic book.  But other than that, there's a nice selection of interesting features on how they made this fantastic film.  Plus, this DVD contains a complete copy of The Hard Goodbye, which is one of the original graphic novels.  It's fun DVD to have.  I hope you like it!
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	I just watched this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised--I mean, I thought it was going to be cute, but nothing special.<br /><br />And STILL Pixar pulled off another win.<br /><br />The lack of wall-to-wall advertising worried me--maybe less work had gone into this than into other 3D movies that were currently taking precedent.  After all, THE INCREDIBLES nearly smothered one with advertising, and it turned out to be one of my favorite movies of all time!  But, I was proved wrong.  As soon as the first black screen of the movie showed, my doubts and fears were alleviated.  PIXAR still has a whole lot left in them, and will for many, many years.  This movie is clever, interesting, and more and more it seems to be the kind of breather I need to get away from all of the crude humor and cheap, cruel laughs that most movies resort to nowadays.<br /><br />If you want to see a good movie, just skip Over the Hedge and go watch Cars.  It's refreshing to see an animation studio making good use of animation again.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"A mind opener that gets your blood boiling.  Related vids I can recommend is: ""A Crude Awakening: The Oil Crash"", ""Blue Gold: World War Water"", ""Super Size Me"", ""America Freedom to Fascism"" (on youtube), ""The American Dream: by the Provocateur Network"" (youtube), oh heck if you want to see dozens of In Your Face Documentaries exposing the Power Elite and the unsustainable society we're in, just visit this site!  More power to the People!: [...]"
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	The Big Lebowski was a movie with a plot riddled with more holes than a Swiss cheese and triumphed because of it. No Country for Old Men is let down by the same flaw. The good points about this movie - the brilliant ersatz 1980s New Mexico borderlands cinematography, the tough landscapes of badlands and small time dusty towns evoke the mood of the McCarthy novel brilliantly. And there are some fine acting performances, especially Javier Bardem as Shigurh, the psychopathic Hannibal Lecterish killer on the loose.<br /><br />But the plot. Jeez. What is going on here. Lazily constructed doesn't even start. From the start - who is the protagonist? The old timer sherrif with his riffs on the decline of the old moral certainties? Nope, because he doesn't solve anything during the movie and his character develops not one bit. Llwelyn Moss, retired welder who comes across a case of a million dollars after a shoot out? Nope, because his final denoument is conducted off scene. The killer, Shigurgh? He is a flat 2d psychopath. That is evidenced early in the movie and he progresses along that predictable trajectory.<br /><br />And the ending is such a let down. This is a slick, elegant, intellectual thriller that fails to paper over the serious flaws in its structure.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Enjoyed a different retelling of a classic.It's nice to see a princess kick butt.I thought Kristen did good,it's not Oscar worthy but can you blame her?If the director really wanted to bring out the best in her why didn't he?But then again it's Snowhite,she's supposed to be beautiful and delicate but not in this movie.She has more boom boom pow than any of the Snowhite movies I've watched except Mirror Mirror where Lily Collins kicked butt too.Read there will be a part 2 but with the scandal that broke out you don't know who's coming back or not.I would still like to see Stewart come back.It's like watching a different movie when an actor/actress is replaced ie Maggie Gylenhaal replaced Katie Holmes in The Dark Knight.If you don't like Kristen Stewart don't watch it.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	i was expecting a movie that was boring and tedious because of all the bad things ive heard of it. what i was served was a good movie with a plot twist at the end that infuriates some people to death. <p>yes, this is a slow moving movie. no, the creatures in the woods arent in every scene, so dont expect them to be. they are more of a sub plot, in the way of the real story taking place. they are more of obsticles in the way of the salvation of the characters. <p>with that being said, this was a good movie. not shyamalan's best, nor does it surpass his previous three movies, but this is still a very good movie. the ending had my brother and other people angry as hell and, personally, i liked it. i thought it was interesting the way it spawned out to be what it was. <p>all in all, the village isnt a memorable movie besides the ending which you will either like or hate. you will not love it, you will not kind of like it or be unsure, you will come to a complete decision as the credits roll. i liked it, and i recommend you to watch this movie with an open mind.
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	I watched the movie, never read the book, heard the hype and read other reviews. I have to say I am very disappointed in this film. It was great until the last 5 minutes. Then it just.... wandered off to nowhere. No closure, no real ending. Did they leave it open for a sequel? Are they going to create serial killer serial films? That is the only thing that makes sense with this ending.<br />The acting is very good. The cinematography is great. The sounds are great. The plot is good... until the end.<br />I would recommend this movie only if you have 2 hours of time to waste... and remember you won't get it back.<br />The coen brother have done other great films. 'Blood Simple', 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing' come to mind immediately and each of those is superb. I would recommend watching one of those first, or instead of.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This movie got to me faster then the shipment time said it would which was great and it was brand new and played great
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is a GREAT CD.  It arrived in a timely manner and was in mint condition, thanks, it was a super Christmas gift for my husband's brother and he shared it with all the family on Christmas Eve.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham is a remarkable comedian.  He doesn't even need his puppets to be entertaining, but the fact that he does have them makes him even more brilliant.  I highly recommend this video for ""laugh out loud"" fun. My one regret is that he has only two DVD's out - come on Jeff, we want more!"
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I love this movie!  We took our 4-yr old son to see this at the IMAX theatre and it was wonderful.  He was reaching his hand out trying to catch the ticket and catch snowflakes.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"This is an incredible, high-paced workout that works!  I have just completed Insanity for the second time and I have noticed incredible improvements.  Not just with my physique, but with my cardiovascular system and most noticeably my upper-body strength (I guess after performing every single, different type of push-up known to man you would get that).  Not only does the trainer, Shawn T, knows how to work your body for maximum results, but he is very motivating during the workouts which is a huge thing for me since if I have to workout i want someone who is mildly entertaining.<br /><br />The only two cons about the program are:  1) you have to be in reasonably good shape to complete the program.  Although this is true, the program encourages you to ""rest when you need too"" so if your not just take the extra breaks and always make sure your form is correct.  It does make me feel good when I see those Olympic-built athletes behind Shawn T (even Shawn T himself) taking breaks throughout the videos. And it is definitely reassuring that after you've been on the program for a while that your still going while they take their breaks.  2)  I haven't had a problem with this since I am relatively young and in good health, but it takes it tolls on your knees and lower back.  There is alot of jumping, squats, and other moves that puts much stress on your knees and back that could cause injury if you had problems with them before.  So I don't suggest you temp fate by trying this program if your prone to injury.<br /><br />Nonetheless, great program with even greater benefits."
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"Although I found the ending somewhat disappointing, I really found this to actually be a great addition to the Indy franchise.  Why do I say this?<br />Because it is filled with the rollicking, high-flying adventure that made Indiana Jones so lovable in the first place.  Also, I cannot believe how many people complained that Harrison Ford was just too old to play Indy anymore.  I don't know what other movie they were watching, but I saw a Harrison Ford playing the part of Indy very well with still a tremendous amount of youth in his blood.  Also, I really felt that Cate Blanchett did a SPECTACULAR job playing the part of Irina Spalko and felt she ""sunk her teeth into those doublevus"" just fine with the Russian accent.  I know that everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I really found much of the criticism hurled at this film really unjustified. The one aspect, however, that I am inclined to agree with the negative reviewers on is with the ending.  I really felt that Spielberg and Lucas could have come up with a much more powerful ending, such as what we saw in ""Raiders"" or ""Crusade"", and instead set the audience up for a rather anti-climatic finish.  This was about my only complaint about the film and, despite this, I still found it enjoyable and definitely worth a viewing."
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"Try not to read any reviews of ""The Village"" that might contain spoilers. This is one movie you DO NOT want to spoil for yourself.<br /><br />It's really disappointing to read about the multitudes who hate/dislike this movie, when it's so wonderfully done. First of all, the suspense is fantastic. Though the secret is out after the first viewing, watching it a second time still had me hiding behind a pillow. This isn't meant to be a horror movie in the way we've come to know the genre. In fact, this isn't  a good movie for the people that like gore and violence in their Friday night flicks -unlike many horror movies, the frightening circumstances are used to tell the story and are not THE story. It's more creepy than terrifying, though there are definitely a handful of frightening moments. The love story element is sweet. Ivy's spunky attitude and Lucius' quiet nature fit well together, culminating in a touching dialogue on Ivy's porch and a strong romantic connection throughout the film. Under all this is the gradually revealed commentary on the horrors and follies of human society, even in such a secluded settlement. It's a film that makes you think, gasp, and enjoy it for all its ingenuity.<br /><br />The casting couldn't be more perfect. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard not just act but become their characters. Phoenix delivers the perfect blend of the shy but stubborn nature of Lucius, while Bryce Dallas Howard entertains as a delightfully spunky but determined Ivy. They each become our heroes as they fight to save each other. Adrien Brody's Noah is also compelling: his mental state and actions are alarming and one must wonder if he had any real conscience or control through it all. Even the movie's score is riveting, from the haunting lilts to its more intense melodies.<br /><br />My only complaint comes upon seeing the movie a second time. The twist (which is fantastic) seems to come a bit too early and we are left with too much knowledge for the rest of the film to remain mysterious. But that's only true when you've already seen it once and know what's going to happen. But that first time is a doozy.<br /><br />It's a Village well worth the visit, even multiple times, in spite of all its loud and unmerited negative reviews. But if you choose to watch it, it's best if all the lights are out."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"Reading the reviews for this movie there seems to be no one pointing out on either side that there is not only no fact supported in this film, there isn't even any claims!!<br /><br />Stein argues that the Intelligent Design ideas are not being taken seriously in the academic world, but he makes NO attempt to prove to us that there is ANY validity in the claim.<br /><br />I agree that no idea should be ""expelled"" if there is merit to it, but does Stein even make any attempt to show us the merit of Intelligent Design?  The scientists that were ""expelled"" for their points and research didn't even make their argument for Intelligent Design."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Loved the idea that I could get a Blu Ray for my player, a DVD for my son, and a Digital copy for his IPOD.  We are huge Harry Potter fans, and this package covered us all!  Great price!
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"This 2 DVD package is a perfect example of why you should purchase the set, rather than just viewing online from a streaming service.<br /><br />The movie is well written, the sets, acting and effects are top level and state of the art.  It leaves one with lots of questions about the Engineers and why each alien doesn't look like the ones we saw in the Alien movies: those questions are answered in a beautiful example of leading-edge technology.<br /><br />If you have an iPad or Android tablet/phone, you can download a Prometheus app that will link with your Blu-ray player if it supports BD-Live!  As the movie plays, background information is displayed on the tablet including production notes and sketches.  At certain parts of the movie, the movie is paused while a video from one of the producers/directors/special effects editors, etc., is displayed on the tablet. The movie then continues.<br /><br />At other places, alternate or deleted scenes are added to the viewing experience at the exact place they fit in the film. You have an option on the tablet to skip the experience, but it is worth watching if you truly want to appreciate the time, talent and effort that went into making this film.<br /><br />The other add-ons on the second disk, including the SD version, Digital Copy and additional resources telling you about the movie are all worth watching. The history of how the movie came into existence is remarkable, as well as how the first Alien movie was completed with a few starts and stops.  The production team and director made it all look too easy and polished when we all saw the first Alien movie...the story is an inspiration for all of us who aspire to be creative, jump hurdles and achieve goals over time.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace brings the same level of intensity and emotion to her role as she did in the ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy. (She was good in Sherlock Holmes too, but the role did not offer anywhere near the challenge of this one.)<br /><br />Charlize Theron continues to amaze with her acting as a hard-core, highly disciplined, driven...but still-wanting-to-be-a-loved-daughter persona.<br /><br />Idris Elba does a great job of balancing out Theron's intensity with calm leadership, focus and demeanor: after all, it's Christmas!<br /><br />Michael Fassbender is both frightening and fascinating as the cyborg with a hidden agenda and a bad habit of listening in on other people's dreams.<br /><br />Guy Pearce makes good use of his screen time although there is not much of it: his movements and voice, along with remarkable make-up transformed him into a very old man with his own special, but not surprising, agenda.<br /><br />The rest of the cast does a good job in adding depth and texture to the story line.<br /><br />If you want to learn an interesting interpretation of the mural they find....watch the add-on info carefully.<br /><br />And....the ending leaves room for a sequel!"
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	For those of you with both high-def formats, you should be aware that the Blu-ray version not only has over twice as much bonus content, but it's in full 1080p video.  The HD DVD version bonus content is only in 480p (DVD quality).  The Blu-ray version also has over a dozen foreign language tracks, while the HD DVD version only has three.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	I know that many people did not enjoy this movie because of major plot holes and whatnot. But I feel it leaves an openness in the movie for each individual to think a little deeper about the meaning.  If you're looking for something to shut your brain off to, you'll miss a lot, and have a bad time.  The visuals are insanely stunning, and the work of Michael Fassbender is phenomenal.  The music really sets the tone of the movie.  Give it a shot, turn on your brain, and enjoy.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"No wonder Jeff Dunham was voted ""Standup comic of the year"". This guy is more than funny. He is clever, imaginative, and a damn fine ventroliquist. Once through this dvd and you'll come to love ""Walter"", ""Peanut"" and some other assorted ""friends"" of Jeff.<br /><br />After enjoying the dvd myself, I've ordered a copy for some deaf friends."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	By now, you must know how amazing The Departed is and how many awards its piled up since it was release.  So I won't bore you with what you already know.  Rather, I'll tell you how disappointing the extra features were.  For example, the 9 deleted features run from seconds to a few minutes long and after viewing them, you'd wish you never saw them.  It's pretty clear why they were cut out, as the movie was already running quite long and these scenes proved unworthy of being included in the film.  The other features including the short documentary about the inspiration behind Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello were not very refreshing either.  My honest opinion is... save the extra 5 bucks and get the one disk version.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I've always been a big fan of Frank Miller ever since I first read <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RIKZEG"">Batman the Dark Knight Returns #1 First Print</a> which I thought then and I still think now is the best comic book about The Batman ever written.  I never read ""Sin City"" and so I watched this without knowing anything about it prior and after having been jaded with really mediocre film offerings over recent years I really wasn't expecting much and so I was blown away with just how good this film is.  It was like watching a comic book come alive and just like my favourite comic book mentioned earlier I really enjoyed this great piece of writing by Frank Miller.  The film reminded me a lot of another great film <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006BSBW"">Pulp Fiction</a> and I guess with the inclusion of Quentin Tarantino as ""guest director"" this shouldn't surprise me but using the same tactic of merging apparently different storylines really works here unlike elsewhere like in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000065V38"">Chungking Express</a> where it really didn't work as well.  Although some have tried and doubtless many more will try in the future this almost new genre of graphic novel films has a new standard upon which others will be measured and this film is it.  Great storytelling, great acting and as far as this dvd goes excellent picture and DTS 5.1 surround sound quality makes this just a great film to watch over and over again like any classic film should be.<br /><br />My great wish now is for the same directors to do an even better job if possible on a similar film version of my favourite graphic novel ""The Dark Knight Returns"".  ""Sin City"" for now though is one of the best films that I've watched in many many years and this dvd is also among the best both picture and sound quality-wise that I've seen on a non-Blu-ray format.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Excellent Movie and great action.  Robert Downey, Jr. is one of the best actor's in Hollywood.  He makes this look effortless.  Wow
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I started this program about six months ago thinking I was in good shape because I had been working out at the gym for 9 months. Insanity showed me I was wrong reallll quick. I could barely get through the fit test, the first time I started this workout. Needless to say, I got my butt handed to me during month 2. I started doing a rotation of month one to get my cardio up. I started the full 60 day routine almost two weeks ago now, and I'm loving every minute of it. I flew through the fit test this go around. This is seriously one of the best workouts you will ever get. I love hearing people ask me if I've been losing weight. It is the best feeling ever. I had knee problems prior to starting this program, and my knee rarely bothers me now. You just have to follow Shaun T's cues to protect your joints. I never thought I would swear by a workout video, but I now swear by this program. Your cardio will be up, and your body will change. Just stick with the program and invest in a good protein supplement to keep your muscles going. The pylo workouts are amazing and even in the recovery workout, your muscles are still on fire. So if you are serious about losing weight and putting your heart into working out, this is your program.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	Where is Doppey?  Doc?  Seriously!!!<br /><br />Yet when you sit back without anything in your mind to pre-judge this title....<br />It was very good.<br />The effects are terrific and the acting was steller.<br /><br />Thor's actor shines through as the huntsman but with that thick accent you can't help but recall Thor through out the film.<br /><br />This is a purchase for me!  Charlize Theron did a marvelous job as well!<br />Some don't care for this due to the TWISTS and changing they did to make this classic tale their own...<br />Check it out for yourself.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"Alan Ball of ""American Beauty"" (Oscar) and ""Six Feet Under"" (Emmy) has created this adaptation of the bestselling vampire series.  All of the actors are wonderful - and sexy (and some are down right naked - thank you Alan).  This is like no vampire film I've ever seen - and a wonderful rift on the whole gay rights movement - with vampires coming out of the closet and demanding civil rights - who'd a thunk it.  Any series with Lois Smith gets my attention.  This is smart, sexy and scary.  Bring on season two - can't wait."
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	"The only reason this film was nominated for an Oscar is because of the Scorcese name and the cast of actors. I think we all have figured out by now that the motion picture academy is like the popular group we all knew in high school. They'll only let a few select individuals in their little clique. As a result, we get the same directors and actors being wrongfully praised as being the top of their fields when they aren't deserving of it. ""The Departed"" is no exception. Let me start off by saying that I was entertained. I liked the movie, but its ORDINARY.<br /><br />This is not an instant classic. It's not a brilliant work of art. Its generic. This is just like every other mobster movie ever made. They try to throw in several twists in the end but it only achieved making the film seem even more pointless. You walk away from the movie learning absolutely nothing. Scorcese didn't cover any new ground. I honestly think Hollywood has forgotten how to make riveting movies. I will note that I thought Leo Dicaprio's performance was really good. He took a mediocre script and did his best to still pull off an amazing performance on his part. Now, Jack Nicholson on the other hand was just plain Jack Nicholson! He acts the same in every movie he's done the past 20 years. If you enjoy hearing vulgar language every other sentence and endless violence with a stale plot, then this is the film for you...otherwise dont go into this thinking you're going to see the best movie ever made."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Highly recommended series....For the fans of the genre who have not watched it yet, it's a gem. Great acting,great production, real southern atmosphere. I am happy that Alan Ball announced that they will start the production of the third season after Christmas. Season 2 is now on every Sunday on HBO and I can't get enough of it.
B000H7I6CU	1.0	b	"Yes, your kid will be drawn to it like if he were hypnotized, and yes he will not blink for the entire duration of the film, and yes you will have some peace... momentarily.  But just wait... when he starts pushing everyone out of the way like if he were in a race car, imitating the bad guy of the story, when he talks back to you using words such as ""moron"" and ""idiot"", when he runs blindly running over everything in his path like a race car, and when his creativity is null, only playing to repeat the movie, finding all other forms of play unappealing, and when he throws tantrums because he wants to see this film over and over and over and over like if there were nothing else in life, you will want to throw this movie as far far far away as you can, and as I did."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	True Blood is amazing!  I would highly recommend the series on DVD so you can watch your favorite episodes over and over again.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Yes, a must see. Warning a bit very much violent, but the movie would not have same impact w/o the horror....-> His honor of keeping his word, beware and listen to what the crazies actually say. Sorry can't say much more w/o giving something away... All in all a movie you will not forget and you will think of later. LoL ask yourself, what would you do?
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	Absolutely a joy to watch.  I was entertained the entire time. acting and cinematography were superb. Brings teh old take to life in a new way and leaves you feeling like you have relived the adventure all over again.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	First time in my life I walked out of a movie! Boring, dull, uninteresting! If I had not paid $1 to see it, I would have been angry. I wasn't the only one that left early. Even if free, it's not worth watching.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	We watch this DVD bi-weekly for entertanment you can't find on TV. We liked it so much we sent copies to family for Christmas presents. They haven't stopped laughing yet!
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	I am not a fan of gratuitous violence, so I did not care for this movie.<br />It is hard to believe that this movie won an Academy award - I used to put a lot of<br />stock in those accolades, but not anymore.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"==== The Review ====<br />The results are real. Once you start you will understand why. It is the most difficult boot camp style workout I have ever done. That said there are a lot of exercise products available. This is for people in good or decent shape looking to take their training to the next level. You will sweat for sure.  I came close to throwing up and even got light headed a few times. I think this is an ideal program for any sport. However, I think P90X is better for sports like golf or baseball. The 60 day program is broken in to 2 30 day phases. The first day has shorter workouts which total about 40 minutes. The second phase has videos that are about 60 minutes. By the time you get to phase 2 your probably going to be in the best shape of your life.<br /><br />--- THE FLOOR ---<br />I train / exercise in my basement.I did P90X on a concrete floor. After about a week of Insanity on the concrete floor I purchased <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EJI6CK"">48 Square Feet ( 12 tiles + borders) 'We Sell Mats' Charcoal Gray 2' x 2' x 3/8"" Anti-Fatigue Interlocking EVA Foam Exercise Gym Flooring</a> for about 30 bucks. Then I put a really thin piece of carpet over it (like the type in an office building for 33 bucks at Lowes)with double sided duct tape. The reason that I put the carpet over it was because it gets really slippery when you get even a little sweat or water on it.<br /><br />--- SHOES ---<br />This may not be news to you but it was to me. There is a big difference between running shoes and cross training shoes. You ABSOLUTELY need cross trainers. No question about it. They provide support for lateral movements. Attempting this program in running shoes could really damage your knees.<br /><br />--- THE ACCOMPLISHMENT ---<br />Beyond the physical rewards, this program gave me the confidence that I can do anything (with in reason) if I am discipline and make a commitment. Really an amazing feeling that I didn't expect."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	It's certainly true that there's little sense of the traditional Hollywood format here. After all, it's based on a Cormac McCarthy book, so what kind of ending can it have? Despite knowing this, I found myself expecting a typical Hollywood twist; it never came, but I wasn't disappointed and quickly came to terms with it. Joel and Ethan Coen seem to me the perfect duo to bring this to the screen. When you look at Fargo and No Country, the Coen brothers suddenly become the intelligent man's Tarantino. Not that Pulp Fiction wasn't brilliant. But there's more of a purpose to the violence inherent in a Coen film; it seems less gratuitous than in, say, Reservoir Dogs, if at times just as pornographic. Strangely, too, the violence is such a part of the fabric of No Country, so pervasive, and the attitude toward it so indifferent, that the audience is quickly desensitized. The landscape of a McCarthy tale is flat, unemotional, disconnected; so it becomes easy to view what would in the real world be a tragedy as merely an occurrence. Violence toward women is not shown on screen here. Obviously it's indicated in the book, and thus in the film, but not showing it seems a directorial choice that fits perfectly with the novelist's style.<br /><br />A theme that was especially interesting was how Josh Brolin's character, Llewellyn Moss, was brought into the path of the ruthless Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) merely by chance--at first. Stumbling onto a drug deal gone terribly wrong, Moss follows a trail that leads him to a case full of cash. Even after he takes the money, he might have gotten away free and clear, were it not for an attack of conscience. And here's where the idea gets more fascinating and tragic: With Chigurh in pursuit, Moss' choice to take the money and run affects the lives of many who cross his path purely by chance--something some may be profoundly aware of in life.<br /><br />On a general note, I loved the film. The performances are fantastic across the board; not a false note is struck by anyone, with a solid throughline provided by Tommy Lee Jones. Supporting characters are varied and fantastically portrayed, by Woody Harrelson, Stephen Root, Kelly MacDonald, Beth Grant, among others. The writing is unexpected and doesn't miss a beat; this is something at which the Coens excel, of course. The direction hits the right tone and keeps the viewer spellbound throughout the film, despite its nontraditional ending.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	They are more realistic then ever. They have drama and curse words and sex and unhappy endings. Just like real life. I've been told I have great taste in movies from a lot of people, friends & family & some people I just met. I read some of the 1 star reviews about this movie. Most of those reviews are stupid people who are picky. One was even mad that the main star in this movie has sex with random women. Big deal! If they have little kids and don't want them to see this movie then don't let them see it. problem solved, I mean have good parenting skills people. It's called common sense! Other people were saying this movie was only special effects. So what that's what makes action movies great. The acting and comedy was there too. I thought it was a kickass movie. Even scientist are trying to make people super human in the future. They gear up are soldiers in iraq pretty hardcore. We can see and shoot around corners without even steping out in dangerous situations.<br />Iron man and the hulk and batman and wanted were all good movies. They made their millions and you see more 5 and 4 star votes on here then you do 1 star soo you know most people liked this movie.
B002QZ1RS6	3.0	b	I got this for Xmas and was very excited - spent the first four days doing this according to plan.  I should add that I am in my 30's and teach fitness classes at my gym and am in pretty decent shape.  I exercise regularly.  However, I have a history of issues with my knees.  I can avoid flare ups if I avoid lunges, etc. This DVD set makes it literally impossible for people with joint issues - especially knees - to participate in this without seriously injuring themselves.  This is stated on the warning at the beginning of the program - however, nowhere did I read that before dropping $150 to order.  Shaun T is awesome - the program is challenging and if you are looking for something to use at home, get this.  It is addicting and intense.  However, if you have even the slightest issue with your knees, DO NOT BUY THIS!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Greetings,<br />The opening scenes reminded me of where I used to work in London just off Whitehall at Great Scotland Yard before the building was shut.<br />The steam locomotive used in the film is a GWR preserved Hall Class No 5972 Olton Hall, although painted in Maroon and Black when Great Western Railway steam locomotives would have been painted Malachite Green!!<br />This edition can only be played on my computer as my dvd/combi is unable to play NSTC DVD'S.<br />Yours Sincerely,<br />Philip Wilton
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	This was hard to find but Amazon came through with a new copy. I bought this for my mother(77), after showing her Spark of Insanity. This Dvd is prime Dunham without the gimicks of later ones.( the toyota prius advertisment and the overdone Achmed in a santa hat)<br />Walter is at his best, Bubba rocks, and peanut is off the charts.This is a must see.<br />Jeff Dunham is a master of The suspension of disbelief.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This is one of the funniest stand up shows I have ever seen. Jeff is a very talented man with a twisted sense of humor. I love this DVD, I'd recommend it to everyone.
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	"First of all, I should say up front that Sin City is not the kind of movie that I would generally choose-I'm not a reader of comic books (or, as they now seem to be called, graphic novels), and although I do enjoy the action genre at times, I'm not a big fan of relentless, unnecessary violence.  And Sin City just might be the most violent film I have ever seen, so much so as to be to the point of absurdity (although, given that this IS an adaptation of a graphic novel series after all, maybe that is appropriate).<br /><br />The movie is actually a compilation of several interconnected stories, chronicles which are told via frequent shifts amongst both characters and time.  The style and general feel of the movie is quite similar to another dark film, Pulp Fiction, although I found Sin City to be more violent and less funny.  The movie opens with a short sequence between a man and a woman, two characters who I still haven't been quite able to place within the context of the rest of the film.  The main stories each feature a chief character:  Bruce Willis as a cop nearing forced retirement but out to save a little girl, an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as an ex-con out for revenge, Clive Owen as a vigilante who goes after the wrong man, and finally, back to Bruce Willis still playing the hero eight years later.  Each principal keeps up a constant stream of narration throughout their segment; this helps to provide necessary background information but becomes annoying after awhile.  However, the cinematography shines, as the film is shot mostly in gritty black and white with occasional splashes of color.  The lack of color actually diminishes the impact of the violence somewhat given that blood generally appears in the film as white, not red.  Did I mention that the movie is violent?  If you are sensitive to fight scenes, frequent maimings, and (not to mention) several beheadings, this movie is NOT for you.<br /><br />If you are a fan of DVD extras, this set is replete with them; at times, I was more intrigued by these than the movie itself.  Disc 1 contains the extended theatrical release plus extras which focus on some of the film's special features, such as the cars, costumes, props, and make-up that went into the making of the movie.  The car segment was particularly interesting, as it shows how various classic cars were sought out to help give the Sin City its film noir feel.  Disc 2 includes some more unique extras, including a fascinating ""green-screen"" version of the film shown at high speed:  in less that 10 minutes, you can view the entire movie sans most of its props and background scenes.  This disc also features each of the stories told individually-as originally conceived by creator Frank Miller-rather than morphed together as in the theatrical release.  Finally, this deluxe set contains a complete Sin City graphic novel of The Hard Goodbye (the story which stars Mickey Rourke).<br /><br />While not exactly my cup of tea, this movie was undeniably entertaining, with the included extras definitely making the deluxe edition worthwhile.  From what I could tell, the film stayed very true to Frank Miller's original graphic novels (almost TOO true, as the dialogue had moments that were undeniably comical, but not in the good way), and so I'm sure Miller's fans will be thrilled with this big-screen adaptation.  If you thought that Pulp Fiction was too tame, this movie is likely to be right up your alley, but those who prefer their action films with less violence should seek entertainment elsewhere."
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Iron Man was a great success for Marvel.  It continues the super-hero genre, with great creativity and humor.  I would have never thought that Jon Favreau could take on a Marvel franchise and be so successful.  This new string of Marvel financed movies are turning out to be great adaptations.  You're gonna love Downey Jr. as Iron Man, and your going to love the action and adventure.<br /><br />Iron Man has a lot of great things that will carry it through a big franchise.  Its humor draws a big audience.  It's technological action, with a strong reality wired in, appeases many skeptics and comic bookies alike.  The film has a strong cast which recently went through some changes for the sequel, but I'm sure it will turn out for the better.  Its adaptation from comic to film is very similar to Batman's recent treatment, with a focused concentration on making the character believable.  In any comic book adaptation, I believe you really have to convince the audience that this person would do this.<br /><br />Besides the great film, the Blu-ray carries a lot of great special features.  I enjoy blocks of video and some picture-in-picture but I dislike Universal's attempt at the rewind, click, rewind, click U-Control.  I was very satisfied by Iron Man's behind the scenes peeks.<br /><br />To pump you up for the sequel I would say this movie is definately one of those comic book movies you should own.  Behind the helmet, and outside of the helmet, Robert Downey Jr. does amazing justice to the character. I wanted a little more action, but that's what a sequel is for.  Get ready for Iron Man Vs. Mickey Rourke!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I must say I've seen just about every superhero movie of the past 10 years, and when the genre should be faltering, it rockets to its best yet with Iron Man. Sure, I was skeptical, I had never heard of the character, and the cast wasn't exactly the type that would make me jump out of my seat. But one night, I decided to see what all the hype was about, because there was no way it could live up to it, right? Actually, it doesn't get enough.<br /><br />The Story: Totally believable. I mean, it isn't everyday you say that about a movie, much less a super hero movie, but this could really be something that could happen in real life. Totally implausible, mind you, but the terrorist part fit today's audiences. And not only does a corrupt CEO selling weapons to our enemies seem believable, I have no doubt that it is/was happening. In fact, when that element of the plot came out, I immediately thought Jeffrey Immelt. And Iron Man/Tony Stark's storyline is as compelling as it is good. Which mean, it's pretty darn compelling and good.<br /><br />The Effects: It terms of quality, yeah, it's awesome. But I didn't think the action sequences were blockbuster quality. Sure, they were good, but I don't remember anything blowing me out of my seat. But hey, I'm probably hard to please.<br /><br />The Suit: I don't say this very much, I mean, I don't pay much attention to the overall suits to these characters, but let me just say, the Iron Man suit is kick-a**! Totally freakin' awesome, and kudos to whoever designed it. If a car, it would probably be a Porche or a Corvette. Sexy all over.<br /><br />Supporting Characters: I wasn't expecting much out of Gyneth Paltrow, but I was very surprised. She was a very strong character, and she was actually pretty good looking. Terrance Howard was underwhelming to say the least, and probably would have been better replaced by Donald Faison, in my opinion. Dr. Yinsen was also a very well-developed character, and when he left, I was actually emotionally attached to him, which is amazing for the short time he was on screen. He was just a very likable guy.<br /><br />Villains: As said before, all very believable and probably the most real villains in any superhero movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent for his role, and played it up to its fullest, but not going over. He knew his boundaries. And what can I say, great look for a villain, terrible name.<br /><br />Tony Stark/Iron Man: Is it too early to say Oscar nomination? I mean, really that character was one of the best to grace the screen since Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. Totally iconic, and perfect in every way. He's likable, funny, quick-witted, smart, compassionate, and bad-a** when he has to be. And unlike most hero castings, there was only one person that could have played it up to this caliber, and that's Mr. Robert Downey Jr. who officially makes his comeback in the best way possible. I mean, I loved Downey all the more because of this movie, and now I'm a major fan, something I never was with Depp. Downey has the character down pat, and he has made it his own.<br /><br />Overall, with amazing casting, a believable story and villains, and just great everything, this movie succeeds in almost every manner. It lives up to the hype and more. This will certainly be a movie I pick up when it comes out on Blu-Ray later this year. All I can say is SEQUAL!!!!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"Sure, the comic book imagery is great, if you're into that kind of thing, with stark black and white colors occasionally splattered with vivid red blood during this movie's many violent fight scenes and shootings. Blood gushes everywhere as a sadistic murderer is hacked to death and violently dismembered. The screen is equally splattered as other characters take multiple bullet wounds without dying, in true comic book form. The nude scenes are not as graphic, but are cartoonish. Mickey Rourke offers his best performance since ""Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man,"" while Bruce Willis shines in his best movie since ""Hudson Hawk."" The plot, which consists of several interweaving stories, is outlandish, and ultimately the movie doesn't hang together so well. It's as if the director spent too much time filling the screen with gore, and not enough time developing an original plot and characters."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I love the whole idea of a world of cars. I loved everything about this movie. Great show to watch again and again : )
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I was extremely happy with the quality of this particular purchase.  The DVD was a gift for my Godson.  Even though he is not even 2 years old, he knew the movie's name.  The DVD was flawless.  We were very pleased with the content and presentation.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"Overall, if you go into the movie with the right expectations, you'll be in for a good thrill, a lot of fun, a one helluva sense of nostalgia. Unfortunately, a very poor story, less than thrilling characters, and incredibly over-the-top action keep this one on the ground. I'd rank it third in the series, only in front of Temple of Doom, which it shares a lot of problems with.<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5<br /><br />Warning, if you have not seen this film, and have tried to avoid all spoilers thus far, you'll be well served when you see the film, because this movie is chock full of very important spoilers. It's darn tough, but I made it through three weeks of release without hearing anything totally major, and the experience was better because of it. From this point, be warned: HERE BE SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />Indy: Ahhh, since riding of on the Jordanian sunset, the good doctor has been very busy indeed. First, he fought in World War 2 (wouldn't you pay to see THAT movie???), and when the aliens landed in Roswell, he was there too, for some strange reason we're never quite privy to. The good doctor can still kick butt, and do incredible stunts, once again proving that like cows, Indiana Jones gets tougher with age. Whether you like this fact or not, since let's face it, Harrison can get the senior discount at Disney Land, right? Really, he hasn't changed personality wise since the last film, he's the same old professor, stressing old. You'll get giddy when he puts his hat on, and let's face it, you love seeing the icon again, right?<br /><br />Mutt: First off, what kind of name is ""Mutt"" for a potential future action hero? And what kind of iconic weapon is a pocket knife, which I believe is was lost in the movie? This could have been a great character, and in some senses he is, but he could have been a helluva lot better. He has a great personality, but he didn't really show he could be the next Indy like Phoenix did back in 'Last Crusade.' And I was very disappointed that Indy didn't pass the torch to Mutt. I mean, are we supposed to deal with old Harrison for another movie, kicking butt in a wheelchair? There's one scene where Mutt almost puts on Indy's hat, which would have been a great ending, but instead Indy takes it away. Very disappointing Spielberg.<br /><br />Other Characters: I found a bunch of characters in this movie just plain uninteresting. Marion, Mac, Oxley, the new dean, and the supporting baddies just didn't interest me. Not to say they were bad characters, I just didn't care for them. Bad character development. And Oxley could have been easily written out in favor for a more interesting plot-mover.<br /><br />Villain: Cate Blanchett is possibly the most overrated actress today. Which isn't hard, when she's almost single handedly dominated the best actress nominations the past few years. Her character could the poorest developed character. Nothing like Belloq, or that rich white guy from 'Last Crusade.' I mean, she pops up, and we're supposed to go, 'Ooohhh, she's real evil.' Not really, I mean, she's more freaky than evil. She's fascinated by psychological warfare? Really, that just doesn't pack any sort of a interesting punch. The character was also stereotypically Russian baddie, in a bad way. I mean, could the character be any more cookie cutter?<br /><br />The Action: Now, Indy has always been about action, so if you don't have action, you don't have an Indy movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem nearly as fun as it was back in the 80's, and it seems a bit forced, and at times uninteresting and unoriginal. Sure the motorcycle chase is fun, but the whole ""Hangar 51"" sequence seems a bit forced, although it does have some of the best moments of the movie. The whole chase sequence in the jungle on the other hand straddles the Hollywood line between believably and just plain ridiculous.<br /><br />CGI: One of the things that George and Steven wanted to do with this movie is keep down the CGI in most cases. However, on which sequences to use the CGI, they chose poorly. CGI BDA (CGI Big Damn Ants) are really testing that Hollywood line, and I really could have done without them. On the other hand, in the overall worst scene in the movie, Mutt swings Tarzan style through the jungle with a bunch of monkeys, and when you watch the background, either somebody forgot their CGI, or somebody needs to go back to computer school. I mean, that was absolutely pathetic, and reminded me of the terrible action background from 'Temple of Doom.'<br /><br />Over the Top: Let me count the ways...<br /><br />1. BDAs scaling each other to get to Cate Blanchett.<br />2. Mutt's Tarzan aforementioned Tarzan sequence.<br />3. Our heroes fall down 3 huge waterfalls with only a scratch to show for it.<br />4. The fact Indiana Jones survives a nuclear explosion inside a refrigerator. Did it have airbags?<br />5. The fact Harrison Ford can take down hefty men twice as young and twice as strong.<br />6. The Aliens. Why Steven, WHY?!?<br /><br />Which brings me too...<br /><br />The Story: What bothered me the most was this: the reason it took so long to get another Indy out was because George and Steven wanted the perfect story, and it took them almost 20 years to find it. And THEY CAME UP WITH THIS????<br /><br />Let me set it up this way, Indy searches for El Dorado, the supposed city of gold with Mutt, who seeks his help to save his mother. Now I must admit, I heard this spoiler, since it already was the worst kept secret in Hollywood, and not hard to figure out. Mutt is Indy and Marion's son. So the family races the evil Russians to find the city of gold, which they find with the help of a half-crazed loon who looked into the eyes of the crystal skull too long, which looks strangely like an alien head. When they finally find the city through strange happenstance, they find a room with not surprisingly, a bunch of alien figures. These aliens by the way helped the Mayans build pyramids and invent technology, which of course they couldn't have figured out on their own, so of course it must be alien.<br /><br />The Aliens soon reveal the temple they've been living in as a large cover for their very large spaceship, which is a page directly out of Stargate. The Aliens then leave, taking all the baddies, and giving Cate an overwhelming amount of knowledge, which promptly causes her to explode. The aliens then take the whole valley with them, and leave no trace. Indiana Jones then explains that El Dorado was not the city of gold, but rather the translation of the city of knowledge. Indy and Marion then get married.<br /><br />I blame David Keopp for this utterly lazy and stupid story, and I blame Steven and George for not realizing it was as bad as it was. I mean, the aliens still look the same as they did in the Spielberg movies years ago. They just don't change their look. Now, I could rail more against the story and aliens, but it appears I've almost written a book here...<br /><br />Anyways, we now can add what to expect with 4th movies from now on. 1st movies in classic series are usually classic and groundbreaking. 2nd usually isn't that great, and is bitter disappointment, and a scar that the director will never live down, they're the ones that ruin the series. The 3rd one may not be as good as the first, but it comes pretty darn close, usually dealing with something besides the action, although that's still there, but it just adds a bit more heart. We can now say that the 4th movie is a crapshoot, and you never can know what to expect. The 4th may not be as good as 1 and 3, but it beats 2, and still retains the aspect of what made the series good in the first place."
B00447G29S	1.0	b	"The anaglyph 3D used here is absolutely JUNK - worse than anything I have seen, and certainly not of the usually high standards of WB Home Video. This is a MAJOR faux-pas for Warner Home Video, and a complete rip off for consumers. Double images, not depth. I urge Warner Bros. to go back and re-issue this in proper 3D form, similar to the ""Journey to the Centre of the Earth"", and let consumers get a replacement disc. What a way to kill the value of this great catalog title!<br /><br />Despite the novelty, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"This bad guy pegs my ""creep meter"" at 10/10; for comparison Hanibal Lechter only rates about 8.5/10;<br /><br />However, as good as it is, I'm sure that it rates any Oscars (but they don't ask me)."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Movie arrived in great condition, packaged well, and fast shipping.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	No, the series does not follow the books but that certainly didn't make it any less enjoyable, it was like getting a double shot of a great story. Loved it!!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I had been waiting to see this movie for months now, and I was afraid that it would disappoint me like some other movies that I have really looked forward to lately (namely The Phantom Menace and Matrix: Reloaded).  So myself and three friends went to see it earlier, and when it ended, I thought one thing: WOW!  This was such an amazing movie, with amazing visual effects, a perfect cast, and tons and tons of testosterone-induced action.<br /><br />WARNING: THERE MAY BE SPOILERS!<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez co-directs (along with Sin City creator Frank Miller, and with Quentin Tarantino as a ""Special Guest Director"") what is, without a doubt, the most faithful comic book adaptation ever.  In fact, Rodriguez sees this film as a translation rather than an adaptation.<br /><br />There really isn't a central plot; rather, the movie is about 3 seperate stories that share certain characters and all take place in Basin City, the most morally bankrupt town ever, which rightfully earns the nickname Sin City.  To call this an all-star cast would be an understatement.  Some of the many actors included in this film are: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Benecio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Devon Aoki, Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, Britanny Murphy, Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Michael Madsen, Nick Stahl, Carla Gugino, Jamie King, Marley Shelton, and Rosario Dawson (yeah, I know that's a lot), and while some of them have very small roles (Wood and Aoki have no dialogue, although neither of them have a small part), all of them are pitch-perfect in their roles.<br /><br />The movie begins with a short segment entitled ""The Customer is Always Right"", with Harnett as The Salesman and Shelton as The Customer.  Up next, is the set-up for ""That Yellow Bastard"", a story about Jim Hartigan (Willis), a cop with a bad heart who is trying to bust the son (Stahl) of a powerful Senator (Boothe) who likes to rape little girls.  Next is ""A Hard Goodbye"", a tale about a huge brute named Marv (Rourke) who falls hard for a beauty named Goldie (King).  They share a passionate night together, but Marv awakes to find Goldie dead in their bed.  A search for ""justice"" ensues, with Marv beating the life out of anyone who has information on the hit.  The story also has Gugino as Lucille, Marv's parole officer, Wood as Kevin, an amazingly gifted killer, Hauer as Cardinal Roarke (the brother of the Senator from ""Yellow Bastard""), and Sin City creator Frank Miller as a priest.  The second story is called ""The Big Fat Kill"".  It deals with Dwight (Owen), an ex-photographer (this isn't explained in the film, but there is a graphic novel that sets up the Dwight character prior to the events of this story) and now a sort of mercenary who goes to Olde Towne to help defend Gail (Dawson) and her fellow prostitutes from Jackie Boy (del Toro), a deranged maniac with a penchant for violence against women.  This segment also has Murphy as Dwight's girlfriend Shellie, Bledel and Aoki as fellow hookers Becky and Miho (deadly little Miho), and Michael Clarke Duncan as Manute, a hired goon for an unnamed mobster.  Finally, ""That Yellow Bastard"" is the last major story.  It picks up after the events of the previous part of the segment.  Hartigan has been sent to prison, because Senator Roarke spun things to make it appear as if he raped little Nancy (played by Alba in her adult incarnation).  Believing Nancy to be caught by Roarke's men, Hartigan gets out and seeks her out to protect her again from people who want revenge upon him for killing (?) Roarke's son.<br /><br />These stories are extremely gritty, violent, and even a little depressing.  (SPOILER)The only one with an ending that could be considered happy is ""The Big Fat Kill"".  There are scenes involving shootings, stabbings, decapitation (or almost so), even cannibalism.  One guy even gets his genitals ripped off.  Also, there is a lot of full frontal nudity (although, from what I understand, nowhere near as much as there was in the books).  So if you feel in any way uncomfortable with any of the above-mentioned things, avoid this movie.  If not, then I highly suggest seeing this film.<br /><br />As I said, the choice of actors for this film was perfect.  I can hardly think of anyone else who could fill the roles of any characters in this movie.  Although, I must say that Willis, Wood, Aoki, Dawson, and Rourke were the big standouts in my mind (even though, as I stated earlier, Wood and Aoki have no dialogue).  Speaking of dialogue, under any other circumstances, the dialogue in this film would be terrible.  However, the actors and situations make it awesome.  Even though many lines are extremely cliched, and I hate cliches, the delivery is amazing.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning.  The film is shot almost completely in black and white.  Although, every now and then, there are splashes of color (certain cars, Dwight's shoes, women's eyes and hair, one of the villains).  Also, many of the shots mirror the panels from the comics.<br /><br />With all that going for this movie, it all adds up to a great 2-hour thrill ride.  Once again, if you don't mind excessive violence, I would highly suggest seeing this movie."
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	The film does not need a long commentary because the character is known by all and he is just the same as before, equal to himself. The film is funny because it reinvents the KGB, the Soviet Union, Stalin and the whole cold war just for fun. It is true that was easy in those days to have an enemy. After all he had the Nazis in one film, so why not the good old Soviet communists. But what is rather surprising is how Spielberg merges some influences in this new film. Amazing how his search is based on riddles, like Harry Potter's adventures. Amazing how E.T. finds his way into Peru and the old Incas, even if they seem to speak Maya. But that's just a Detail of course. But I find this not as creative as we could have expected. To attribute human culture, human civilization to the coming of an extra-terrestrial species of intelligent beings that looked like plain terrestrial human beings, to teach the very primitive human beings how to grow potatoes or corn is slightly trendy but banal. To bring together Siberia, the Pharaohs and the Incas, Mayas and why not Aztecs is rather easy and founded on so little. It is true there is also the theory that everything came from Antarctica with extra-terrestrials and all the paraphernalia of that sort, but that had been used by Aliens and Predators. He apparently preferred Stephen King's approach and his Tommy-knockers but without the cruelty, the vampirism of King, just the subservient gullibility of human beings who believe in a legend and that these strange beings were ready to share. Why not, since they officially did it before. That's one of the big contradictions of this film. These extra-terrestrials are not logical: they don't share their knowledge and they even try to destroy those who help them to move to that twilight zone lying (two meanings) between two universes. I must say Anne Rice's rewriting of these myths and legends is a lot more convincing and creative because she remains essentially human and her beyond belief idea is to bring in both witches and vampires. But these are human somewhere, are our everyday neighbors and friends, not the distant extra-terrestrials, and Anne Rice remains within the scope of human feelings, passions, derangements too but human all the same. The most attractive element is of course the third generation of Joneses. The dear Indiana Jones is finally provided with a son and that son is the one who takes him into the adventure. Hence he is the sequel of the old aging Indiana Jones who repeats he is old and aging so many times that I lost count about 20 minutes after the beginning. And it is true there are a couple of slower moments. But after all it is extremely moral and ethical since the younger Jones is provided with a married couple of parents at the end. Charming. Too charming for Indiana Jones. But we will have to do with that small detail. After all Harrison Ford had to step down in style, that is to say in church.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	Excellent Fast Paced deeply Engrossing Saga Of  Infiltration of The Irish Mbb, and Its Hold On people In All walks Of Life...A True Thriller!
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	One has to be very careful when considering the opinion of professional film critics.  The thing is, they have to watch a lot of movies, and as we all know, the vast majority of movies are perfectly horrible.  So when the critic comes across something that is mildly interesting or relatively well-made, they sometimes can't help themselves but to gush praise all over it.  That, I think, is what happened with Old Men, which has been given a rather remarkable amount of critical acclaim, but which will be looked upon in twenty years or so as just another mediocre thriller.<br /><br />It does have its good points.  For once, the Coen brothers played it straight, rather than snickering at their audience from behind the screen, and what do you know:  they are actually quite skilled at the art of film-making!  They take their time to set the mood of the film, with long, panoramic views of the desolate Texas landscape.  These might very well serve as a metaphor for the mayhem and chaos later depicted.  They are also very good at building tension.  A couple of scenes, particularly the hotel scene with the murderer creeping about in the hallway, are quite riveting.  And they managed to come up with some really terrific acting, particularly the smaller roles.  Every single one of these people--the store owner, the hotel clerk, the border guard--are absolutely authentic.<br /><br />The problem with the film is the problem that plagued the book:  the plot.  In a nutshell, our hero finds a stash of money, decides to keep it, then spends the rest of the film trying to get away from the malevolent forces that want it back.  Good grief, hasn't this been done about a million times?  And wouldn't you know, the malevolent force is practically superhumanly evil and indestructible.  And hasn't THAT been done about a million times?  My goodness, the alien, the predator, the terminator, Hannibal Lecter, the Godfather, Colonel Kurtz . . . you can't hardly turn on the TV without seeing an indestructible, superhuman, evil murderer roaming around!<br /><br />The difference perhaps is that the murderer in this movie, Chigurh, spends a lot of time mumbling about fate and destiny and that sort of thing--just before he blows somebody's brains out with his cattle gun (a super-evil tool!) or his shotgun--which somehow means that we're supposed to take all of this ludicrous mayhem seriously.  Obviously, a lot of critics did, but don't be fooled.  This is a monster movie--a well-made monster movie to be sure--but a monster movie and nothing more.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	This is a fantastic film. Scorcese's films are often too long, but they are always well made and he gets some fine performances out of Leo Di Caprio, Matt Damon and Jack Nicholson. Mark Wahlberg also gets a fantastic small supporting roll. Whether the end is ideal, I am not sure,  but the ride up to it is absolutely fantastic. I am not a big fan of Leonardo Di Caprio, he was miscast in Gangs Of New York, but he has shown a mature performance in Blood Diamond, and The Departed is probably his best role to date. Matt Damon is also excellent as the bad good guy.<br /><br />With the likes of Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin, also in this movie, there is a top cast to add to the fine story, with twists and turns based on events involving a Boston Police Department and Jack Nicholson's crime lord and his gang.  Definitely, the film of the year, and the best thing I have seen since Crash & Brokeback Mountain, which won and finished runner-up for Oscar glory last year. Enjoy.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I have read all the books Charlaine Harris has written for this series and I am happy with the way HBO has handled the mini series. Of course the show will be different than the books, no one can portray everything the same as you read it, and I was excited to see the way the series took off! It is different enough that I feel like I have a whole new series to enjoy without knowing what will exactly happen. The characterization is very well done towards the way Charlaine Harris has written them in her books plus more that only HBO can add. It was such a blessing to see them pick up her series as some of the more erotic content can be show-cased. This is just one of the ways this show has became so popular and will stay popular for time to come. The DVD of the first season I was happy to see the way the disks were arranged except I would have liked separate cases instead of a fold-out but the information on the fold-out is nice as are the pictures of the main characters. This is one of my prized DVD collections now.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"""Iron Man"" Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Directed by Jon Favreau<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is head of the extremely successful weapons manufacturer Stark Industries. Tony heads to Afghanistan for a demonstration of his latest creation. Unfortunately on the return trip Stark's military convoy is attacked and Tony is taken captive. His captors demand that he build a missile for them. Tony discovers much to his dismay, that the militia that has captured him is well armed with weapons from none other Stark Industries. His former cavalier attitude about his weapons changes and he decides to move his company into a different direction but first he has to create his means of escape...<br /><br />This was another great addition to the Marvel stable. I can't speak for the die hard Ironman fans about how true the movie is to the comics (I was always a Wolverine Fan) but I think overall the story was well told and well thought out.<br /><br />The Good: I was a little bit skeptical at first but Robert Downey Jr. actually portrayed the Tony Stark Character very well. The movie overall was well cast. I think Gwyneth Paltrow was perfect for her role as Pepper Potts and Jeff Bridges (formerly the Dude) was very convincing in his role as Obidiah Stane. As always look for Stan Lee to make a cameo but this time he actually plays a known person and it was pretty funny even though very brief.<br /><br />The special effects and action sequences didn't disappoint. The flight sequences were all very fast paced and had good intensity. The suit was very well done and stayed true to the comics from what I've seen.<br /><br />The sound track was also good with tracks from A/C D/C, Black Sabeth and Suicidal tendencies.<br /><br />The Bad: For me nothing. As I said if you are a die hard fan you won't be able to help yourself at picking apart any inaccuracies from the comic to movie translation. There was a little bit of shamless Audi product placement but that is to be expected.<br /><br />Overall: This was another great addition to the Marvel stable. If you are interested in comic based movies got out and see ""Ironman""!"
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	I don't understand why so many reviewers are giving this movie 5 stars when it is more like a 3.0-3.5 star movie (5 stars for visuals, sets and designs). The plot contains too many inconsistencies in an otherwise technically beautiful film.<br /><br />Sci fi movies are supposed to contain intelligent characters. In this film many act in a completely illogical manner, some are even eligible for Darwin awards.<br /><br />The geologist and biologist characters seemed intelligent at first, being skeptical and cautious about the alien environment they were exploring. After they become seperated from their crew the biologist decides it is a good idea to pet the hostile alien snake creature and both end up getting killed or infected in a scene that looks like it was created purely for the spectacle. WTF were they thinking?<br /><br />The geologist later shows up at Prometheus' doorstep as a zombie in an unusual yoga pose (reminiscent of an posessed character in a exorcist/japanese horror film, just plain lame) and none of the crew notice his unusual appearance and end up getting killed.<br /><br />There are many other plot/character irregularities that have been posted all over the internet so I won't repeat them here.<br /><br />I am completely dumbfounded as to how such a critically acclaimed director such as Sir Ridley could approve these scenes. The screenplay writers may be the ones to blame but surely the ultimate responsibility lies with him.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"COMMENTARY TRACK and DELETED SCENES.<br /><br />After shelling out over twenty bucks for a two-disc special edition DVD, I expect a commentary track and deleted scenes. Or at the very minimum one of the two. But this DVD offers neither.<br /><br />Now, I'm not going to delve into the debate over whether this is a good ""Indiana Jones"" film. To be honest, I enjoyed it on its own merit, but it does not compare to the original trilogy.<br /><br />With that said, the DVD release is a major disappointment to this long-time Indy fan. I will say that the making-of feature is impressive; most of Lucas' making-of features usually are, so it didn't come as a surprise. But it still left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The three-star rating is for the DVD itself, not the film - if you're here, you've probably already decided how you feel about the film. My advice to casual fans is to stick with the standard one-disc release. Hardcore fans might find the making-of bonus features worth it."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I sure miss Sweet Daddy D. I'd trade him for Melvin, the Super Hero in a minute. However, Achmed is a welcomed, hilarious addition. Walter, Peanut and Jose and all back in fine form, as is Jeff's custom, and this would make a good addition to your DVD library. Happily, it's not 'politically correct' but, much more happily, the flawless ventriloquial talent and good comedy make this a great performance from a truly gifted individual. I'm anxiously awaiting his next DVD release.

B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"This one was a true winner!  What a great story!  Disney has done it again!<br /><br />I borrowed this one from my local video rental service and was quite pleased with the total value and extra materials on this one.  A nice story about not ""burning your bridges"" as our hero did at the beginnig of the story.  But by the end he learns his lesson, and comes out on top.<br /><br />Nice little story about Route 66 as well.<br /><br />Kind of makes me want o rent an RV, and drive down Route 66.<br /><br />Where were all the people?<br /><br />MC White said:  Well, a'iiiight!"
B005ZMUQCK	1.0	b	"This movie is great family entertainment.  My kids love it and I really enjoy it.  I think it says a lot about the incredible people at Pixar that THIS is probably their weakest film.<br /><br />My major disappointment is with the DVD.  Pixar has always had great ""Special Edition"" DVD releases. With each film they've improved the features. They usually have close to an hour's worth of `behind the scenes' documentaries.  And they weren't released as a special edition at a later date.<br /><br />On Cars, it's about 15 minutes and includes NO `making of' content.  It's a good feature about John Lasseter's inspiration for the story.<br /><br />Usually, there are features about story development, animation techniques and other insights into the creative process that follows the years of work involved in making these films.<br /><br />The Incredibles had tons of  Behind the Scenes features as well as 2 commentary tracks with writers and animators, giving you over 6 hours of extra content.<br /><br />Over these many films, I have come to know and love the creators as much or more than the films themselves. I was a lot more excited about purchasing this DVD than my kids were.<br /><br />Pixar truly had captured the `magic' that used to be Disney Animation, even in the Walt-style `behind-the-scenes' features.  Then, Disney, who in recent years has given us `creative triumphs' such as Cinderella 2, Little Mermaid 2, Beauty and the Beast 2 and  Lion King 2 and 3, bought Pixar.<br /><br />I don't think it's a coincidence that the first Pixar release since the Disney buyout is being sold for the same $20.00 price, with minimal content.  Disney is clearly going for bigger profits and ripping off fans of Pixar.  I certainly don't believe that Pixar would suddenly change direction and offer their fans less.<br /><br />Disney doesn't deserve a 5 star Amazon customer rating for such a lame product.<br /><br />You don't have to hate the movie to rate this `release' as being poor.<br /><br />I'm personally casting this as my vote AGAINST  Nemo 2, 3 & 4 or A Bugs Life: The Grasshoppers Return!"

B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	Even when discounting the hype, this movie was poorly written. By far, this was the worst movie I have seen that Ridley Scott had anything to do with. I doubt I would ever watch it again. Did Hollywood screw up another great series?<br /><br />The dialogue alone is extremely amateur, and I kept finding it hard to imagine the characters as professionals, scientists, etc. Many times, the characters' logic, or ability to reason was non-existent. More importantly, there was absolutely NO Fear Factor.<br /><br />The plot started out with some great creativity, bringing a completely new takes on aliens, but feel apart quickly. The few attempts at a witty twist during the story and the end fizzled. Numerous attempts to be smart, funny, strong or scary with these characters failed. This is one movie where I wish hadn't wasted my time and money at the theater.<br /><br />Story: 2<br />Acting: 2<br />Dialogue: 1<br />Action: 2<br />Fear Factor: 2

Plus the Blu-Ray format really shines for this title; because the whole movie is computer generated, you can REALLY see all the details at 1080p!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!"
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	Highly dissapointed that I brought this set for someone as a gift and come to find out it won't play not only on any of our dvd players (Blu Ray or otherwise) but it won't even play on my Dell Windows Media Center.

B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	I watched this video but in the end, it's always the same. Ben never asks the right questions.  Here's just 4 simple questions he doesn't ask:<br /><br />1/4) If ID is NOT religious, what's the scientific difference between ID and what every university on earth teaches?<br />2/4 Natural selection is not random chance, so why do ID defenders treat is as such? (even if it WERE random chance, the universe is large enough to handle such odds.)<br />3/4 We don't know the origins of life, why is not knowing the answer so scary?<br />4/4 Ben brings Nazis into the mix to show how bad atheism is, but why doesn't he give equal time to the Spanish inquisition, crusades, witch trials or the genocide of the native americans?
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"This documentary exposed the hypocrisy of those who claim to be open-minded.  Usually those who claim to be open-minded feel the need to make this statement, because it's obvious to anyone who listens that they are only ""open"" to those who agree with them.  Someone once said of such individuals, ""they will defend to the death your right to agree with them.""  Science is objective, but people forget that scientists are not innately objective, at least no more so than anyone else.  As a psychologist I am aware that extreme intelligence does not protect one from insecurity. The insecurity creates a need to be right, because criticism of their ideas or position on an issues is experienced as a personal attack. In fact, people who are extremely gifted in a specific area, but who have fragile egos, often form their identity upon their area of giftedness.  Such individuals have no tolerance for criticism, and often experience extreme rage when faced with people who question them.  This is referred to as narcissistic wounding; google the term for a much better description than I am offering here  Of course, not all scientists are these fragile wounded people, but I would hazard a guess that many are, especially if they were teased, ostracized, or rejected by other children and adolescents due to their extreme intelligence -- or they were praised for their intelligence to the point that it became the foundation of their worth.  When that happens, the area of expertise -- ironically - becomes like a religion -- it saves them, gives their lives meaning and cannot be questioned.  Perhaps that's why so many are so extremely and emotionally antagonistic to religion; it challenges their own faith that sustains the meaning of their lives."
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	Sin City is indeed a five-star film-but knowing that this DVD doesn't have all the goodies that the special edition will have, this one's good for a rent. The movie is very faithful to the comics in terms of character design, atmosphere, and even dialogue, which is quite a nice first! The music didn't really seem fitting at first (you wouldn't expect to hear raspy saxophones at the beginning of an ultra-violent movie based on an ultra-violent comic), but eventually, it really blends in with the dark, gory atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />But boy, if you take anyone under 15 to see it (I'm 16), you will live to regret it. It is SO violent, SO intense, that those with weak stomachs will not even be able to bear the soundtrack's hard jazz saxophone grunts and techno beats or the unrelenting violence that lasts throughout a vast majority of the two-hour film.<br /><br />One of the big plusses in the film is that even with such insane amounts of violence, it has a PLOT, not to mention the fact that it has a star-studded cast, filled with men that make girls cream and chicks that make boys (like me) salivate. And by that, I don't just mean Bruce Willis.<br /><br />The men that make girls drool include Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood (aka Frodo Baggins), Josh Hartnett. Clive Owen, and, for those older ones out there, Mickey Rourke and Michael Clarke Duncan. As for the chicks that make us guys drool, you got Carla Gugino, Jaime King, Brittany Murphy, Alexis Bledel (Gilmore Girls), Rosario Dawson and Jessica Alba. All of them, among many others. Also, fans of Japanese animation from ADV Films should know Jason Douglas, who does a good job on screen as a hitman.<br /><br />Also notable is that the film really does well illustrating the atmosphere of the comic. For the most part, the film is in black and white, but certain color effects are used (in some instances) for eyes, blood, and (in one case) skin.<br /><br />But once more, take note: do NOT show this film to a child or watch it when a child is awake in the house it is being viewed in, and do NOT watch it if you are the squeamish type, it is the most intense, unrelentingly violent film I have EVER viewed. However, with that said, I can safely say this: it's a five star film, but a four star DVD. Wait for the special edition, and rent this for now.
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	This isn't the type of film I'd watch on a regular basis, but I was on a plane and this was the featured movie so I tuned in. It was cute. The movie is about a truck that's friends with a race car, but another set of cars are plotting against the race car over a battle about oil. This turns into a Secret Service car style plan between the two groups to decide who is better. There were some cute parts, and it was amusing enough to keep me entertained. It's not the type of film I'd run out and buy, but I do think it'd be fun for kids and adults alike.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This product arrived in perfect as new condition even those it had been specified as used.  having watched the series I found it well acted and fast moving.  My granddaughter is a fan othe show and watches it repeatedly.  Looking forward to receiving Season 2 which I have advanced ordered.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	As a fan of fairy tales and myths, the movie was an adult version of the story. This darker version was interesting and entertaining and I would recommend this to any fan who enjoyed the Snow White tale as a child.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	I liked this addition, too, though not quite the caliber that his previous was. It was funny throughout, but a little segment that I wasn't laughing because the humor dried up a notch. Still, Jeff delivers his insane talent with puppets as a sidekick, and it's worth adding to my collection.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	I thought I knew what I was getting when I bought this movie.  I had watch it in the theater and was excited to watch on the big screen in my home.  During the opening sequence I knew something was amiss and it just got worse from there.  The video quality is the worst I have seen on a recent release highly touted movie.  I have a Toshiba HD-A2 HD DVD player which does an outstaiding job upscaling DVD's and it couldn't even help this horrendous rendering.  Interestingly the first and last 15 minutes are the worst.  During these times there is so much macro blocking it appears that Harry's glasses are actually not round but a very odd shape made of many 90 degree angles.  In the part where the kids are listening to the parents in Sirius' house with the extemdable ear, as you look up at their faces from the bottom you really can't tell who is who their faces are so blocky.  During the action sequence at the end this macro blocking is also very apparent.  I am so dissappointed that I am taking the movie back.  I will not buy and keep this kind of lousy rendering job from a top tier movie, which brings be to an interesting thought.  Are studios purposely creating DVD's that look like garbage so that their HD versions appeal more to people?  If so, this is a devious and underhanded ploy, which makes me thing that it is what is happening, so like a lemming I will go jump off a cliff and fork over twice the ammount for the HD DVD version and see what I get.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I love Robert Downy Jr. so this is a plus for me..  this is one of his best performances.  And I can't wait for the next Ironman movie to come to life.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	The John Adams miniseries was well done, informative and accurate, portraying the struggles of our emerging nation. In addition, it's a great refresher course in early American history. It is my hope that similar biographies of U.S. presidents will be made. I would certainly buy such products.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	I'm not from SoCal, so I can't comment on the BK product placement (which was so obvious as to be perhaps intentionally ludicrous?) I would definitely go for In-and-Out waaaay before BK, whether or not I'd been in an Afghani cave for 3 months.<br /><br />I've never read the comic book, and never been that much into them anyway. This is definitely not the semi-plausible superhero (Batman) nor is it the completely implausible (X-Men). That leaves the techno-superheroes: Iron Man. I'm not sure which I find more implausible. But I must admit a buff Robert Downey Jr. is better eye candy than Toby McGuire. That, of course, could easily lead to a super-hero comparison via the eye-candy factor.<br /><br />What seemed a bit lurching was the pace of the beginning and end. The beginning is slow, but not unpleasantly ('get to know the cast of characters and understand the hero's tragic flaws'). But it seemed to be rushing towards the end - fast paced action, sure - but this seemed like someone abruptly realized it was already min.120 and counting, and had to hurry to end it.  Sad, because I was still enjoying it.<br /><br />Downey was spectacular as the nascent superhero, developing the new suit. A childish joy immediately squashed by Newtonian physics. Childish, yet thoroughly amusing consequences (several squashed cars).<br /><br />Script?  ok<br />Direction?  ok<br />FX?  good<br />Robert Downey?  totally makes the movie.  He inhabits the part.  Nothing else is really that spectacular, but you don't notice being so engrossed with him.<br /><br />Elizabeth's rating: 2<br />The special effects are better on the big screen
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"It's a lofty statement, but hear me out.  The film is a perfect meditation on violence and how it is destroying our country as we know it.  The film is not meant to be senseless violence, to all you idiots out there who decided that that's all the film was.  As is the case with all Coen Brothers films, you need to look deeper than what is on the surface.  I mean, at first glance, Fargo is a disturbingly unsympathetic kidnapping and murder story.  But once you look into the subtext, and you really focus on what all of the individual events mean, everything makes sense, and the true genius of the film is revealed.<br /><br />No Country for Old Men is exactly like that.  While it is a perfect modern western in all of its amazingly done shoot-outs and suspense scenes, there is so much more to everything that happens.  Anton Chigurh isn't just a psychopath after money at all costs.  He is an omen, a prophet of destruction, leaving death behind wherever he goes.  He flips a coin because chance is a part of fate, and it determines who lives and who dies.  All of the violence in the film isn't made for just pure cinematic enjoyment...it is made to show just how out of control our society can get, and how powerless the law is over such cruelty and depravity.<br /><br />The ending perfectly sums everything up.  I will not give anything away, in that it is a customer review, but focus on what each individual scene towards the end means.  I'm so sick and tired of people critisizing the ending because it is ""dull"".  The ending was made to express the themes and ideas brought into play by the rest of the film in a beautiful, poetic way.  So please, stop critisizing the ending just because you don't get it.  If you understand it, and still don't like it, that is a different story, as you're entitled to your own opinion.  But just don't complain about the film just because the Coens made it have a meaning, and it wasn't just stupid mindless violence."
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	My 2 year old son loves toy cars, but could never sit through the whole movie.  I like it.  Maybe he's just too young for it...although he loves the movie happy feet, and could watch it three times straight if you let him...
B001KEGR8Y	3.0	b	Some of the puppets were funny, some weren't.  Could take it or leave it.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Going to the movies can be so incredibly dissapinting these days. It seems like almost every movie that seems to have any sort of promise or tries something different falls flat on it's face in the process. Enter Sin City. Dont bother with the back story just sit down and watch. You can't help but be glued to the screen, all the characters are amazing. Marv is easy the tour de force of the movie, but there are also nice little surprises, for example the two thugs that speak to each other using elegant prose. I cannot recommend this movie enough. If you are a person who can't watch violence skip this one. Keep watching the boring predictable trash hollywood throws your way.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This video will change the way you look at food. It will also alert you to how we are being taken advantage of by the large food producers. They look at us just about the same way they look at a beef cow. The ominous revelation of one multi-national company taking control of all the seeds in the world and crushing anyone who stands in their way is breath-taking. The callous disregard of small children dying of e-coli in favor of relaxed inspections and regulations for the sake of profits is painfully shown through the eyes of a conservative Republican mother turned food safety activist. All it took for her was the death of her two-year old son to learn the hidden story.<br /><br />Although some have accused the film makers of left-leaning bias, an independent study of the facts will confirm their even-handed treatment of the subject.<br /><br />Wake up and tell others.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	HBO has done it again with another awesome show. I have been hooked on Entourage since it came out and a friend of mine told me to check this show out. I just went and bought it today and i cant stop watching it. Im from the south, and this show hits the nail on the head about how the deep south is. The story is great and the characters are even better. This show puts that movie twilight to shame. The story is better and the acting is WAY better. I cant wait for the second season to start next month. I would recommend this show for anyone.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"An abysmal, overbloated failure with a plot lifted out of old Twilight Zone rejects. Laughable, hackneyed script. Worst film of 2004!<br /><br />Okay, good photography and ONE good performance (Howard) should not be enough for anybody.  Brody is an embarrassment in probably the stupidest role in the history of the movies. Everyone else is wasted in parts that, to quote Roger Ebert, ""move below the one-dimensional and enter Flatland.""<br /><br />This is a mess of a failure so monumental it's amazing even one viewer hasn't angrily stomped out of the theater by midpoint. And the ending is so lame, so insipid, so unoriginal, so plain stupid that I am amazed it isn't laughed off the screen. A TERRIBLE STINKER that deserves total oblivion.  They ought to pay you to watch this turkey."
B00447G29S	1.0	b	We bought this for our kids thinking that watching it in 3-D would be AWESOME but were sorely disappointed. Barely any of the movie actually showed up as being 3-D. We darkened the room to see if that would help and we adjusted the contrast as suggested but it still didn't help. Thankfully, there was a regular version in the box as well so we stopped the 3-D one and popped in the original. Much better.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and stick to the non-3-D version!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I run regularly- generally 45 minutes to an hour 3-4 times a week. I bought this hoping to step up my exercise and it delivers. I've been disappointed by other fitness DVD's that are easy after the first few times or too complicated to follow. The warm up on this one is harder than most fitness DVD's are all together.<br /><br />This one is great- the workouts are simple to follow, but really hard. I need to take breaks and modify exercises at times, but I still feel I get a killer workout. Truth be told, I'd be disappointed if I didn't struggle the first few times. I feel like I am getting a great total body workout- the plank work is helping my upper body, something running does not address and the plyo jumps are taxing my legs in a good way. The stretching is good as well.<br /><br />I will say- I have some back issues but a week into this and my back is not hurting. I think this DVD is not for a ""first time exerciser"", but if you have a level of fitness and some idea of how to modify exercises on your own, you'll get use out of this. For example- if jump squats are killing me, I might do the last 10 seconds as regular squats. I look forward to being able to match Shaun jump for jump!<br /><br />And this is a great workout- it leaves me good sore and good tired. I'd put the exertion up there with a 10 mile run in terms of what it takes out of my body. It also includes a sensible looking eating plan."
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Obviously a different kind of Snow White story.  Geared more for adults and teens, rather than young children.  Beautiful special effects, with some twist from the original story.  Well worth two hours of your life. Keeping this short, (I hate long boring reviews. Do people really think we read those things!!!) it was a movie worth seeing.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	A thorough, informative and relevant analysis and expose of the bias in the educational establishment today against presenting all the facts in the critical question of origins.  Highly recommend this for anyone with an open mind.
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	I was very surprised at this series. People have recommended it to me over and over, even my own sister who has HBO told me i should buy it and watch it. What I wish i had know was the mature content in this series. First episode about 5-10 min was a sex scene and I was like Oo what in the hell did i just get myself into. Overall the acting was good, the storyline was good. Despite unexpected the guys were nice to look at I'll admit xD but i sold the series to Hasting the day after I finished watching the series. I'm glad i got it for only the $12 on black friday i wouldn't have paid the full price and be happy with it, I want to see the second series just to see it, but I don't want to buy it. There are 12 episodes in this first season, be warned about every episode has at least a naked person in it, if not a sex scene. Otherwise if that doesn't bother you, you're left wondering who was doing the murders until those few episodes, it drags in. I watched all the episodes back to back I couldn't stop, but once I finished it left me wondering about the next season, but unlike Vampire Diaries I can wait, I'm not in omg omg i gotta see it phase xD.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"I believe one of the best things to happen to the big screen was when they started filming Marvel Comics. Honestly, I'll go see an action-adventure or science fiction fantasy film on the big screen over any other genre. And the Marvel classics translate very well to film, particularly if you have a writer like Peter David doing the novelization.<br /><br />The story in brief:  when Star Industries CEO and wunderkind engineer Tony Stark (Downey, Jr) is kidnapped by terrorists, he builds an Iron Man suit to escape rather than creating the missile they demanded.<br /><br />Back at home, he decides to convert Stark into a more politically correct company and 'make peace instead of war.'  He hadn't reckoned with the terrorists re-arming and deceit from his own camp.<br /><br />The acting's great. I think Terrence Howard (Colonel Rhodes) is going to be the next Denzel Washington.  He's a good actor and easy on the eyes. Jeff Bridges broke out of type and served as a pretty amazing Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />The imagery is fabulous. Scenes from Stark's capture were gripping.  His fellow captive, Yinsen (played by Shaun Toub) was an interesting and sad character, such a waste of a brilliant man.<br /><br />The soundtrack is particularly good with strong, evocative musical images. Okay, I wish they'd used Black Sabbath's version of ""Iron Man"" for the soundtrack, but that's already been used by both ""Detroit Rock City"" and ""Lords of Dogtown.""<br /><br />Best of all, for a vertigo sufferer like me, there was minimal monkey cam.  I could follow almost all the action without a problem.  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ""Iron Man"" and may well see the film again before it leaves the big screen."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This video will have you crying from laughter in no time flat.  Jeff Dunham is by far, the funniest comic I have ever seen.  This video is so funny that I had to watch it a few times because I kept missing things because I was laughing too hard and missed some lines.  A must have!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This is a great movie! The bonus features are very entertaining. I hope Hollywood makes more movies like this!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is a very funny guy - or is he?  You get so involved with his characters that you actually feel like they are real, and he's just the straight man.  A very funny show.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is one of the greatest.  When ever I need to laugh I just watch his videos. Fast shipment very pleased with product.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"My 16 year old daughter wanted this movie because she enjoys it so much!  This movie is for ""young and old"" alike."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"At the very end of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" Emma Watson says, ""Everything's going to change now, isn't it?"" I remembered that quote going into ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" the fifth installment of the series; the films have greatly changed, especially in terms of heavy-handed subject matter. Not only is this film even darker than the last, it's also more mature. This is somewhat disappointing, but it is to be expected; the main characters, after all, are now fifteen years old. I have to admit that I was ready to give this film a lower ranking, simply because it lacks the bright, whimsical charm of Chris Columbus' brilliant ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."" But then I realized that I was unfairly trying to compare two very different films. On its own, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is an incredibly well made fantasy film--well written, well acted, and great to look at, all while retaining the essence of J.K. Rowling's novel.<br /><br />The plot, while a bit complicated, is quite engrossing. In his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) will find that the odds against him are increasing. It begins when he's put on trail for breaking the rules and using magic outside of school (he had to save his cousin from a Dementor). Cornelius Fudge, the Head of the Ministry of Magic (Robert Hardy), is convinced that Harry never witnessed Lord Voldemort's resurrection. He also believes that he and Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) are conspiring to take control of the Ministry. In response to this, Fudge gives the Ministry the power to enforce new rules at Hogwarts, rules so strict and unreasonable that they practically become dictatorial.<br /><br />As part of the regime change, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is introduced (as they have been in each of the films). Here enters Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), a woman that truly redefines what it means to be the teacher from hell. She oversees a complete overhaul of Hogwarts' policies, from dress codes to class schedules to curriculums. Even social interaction is highly restricted, as seen when a kissing couple is forcefully separated. Her uncompromising attitude is only made worse when joined with bright smiles, girlish giggles, and frilly pink dresses. This woman is incredibly phony, a ruthless, seething control freak who unfairly demands respect and loyalty. Harry understands this all too well; while in detention, he's forced to write sentences with a special quill. Let's just say that it makes a definite impression.<br /><br />Fearing that their defensive skills aren't being challenged enough--and fearing that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is nearing--Harry and his friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) secretly form a rebellion of sorts. Harry teaches the students a number of spells, hoping to prepare them for battle with Voldemort's army. The youthful passion and naivety is just as fascinating as it is baffling; a group of teenagers are willing to fight against evil, even if they don't have what it takes. Of course, no one understands this more than Harry, who begins to have terrible dreams and disturbing visions directly related to Voldemort. Unfortunately, Professor Dumbledore is of little help; for as yet unknown reasons, he's been avoiding Harry the entire school year.<br /><br />The film progresses quite smoothly for something so convoluted. Consider the fact that the students still maintain social relationships while all this is going on. For Harry, a teenage romance between him and Cho Chang (Katie Leung) is alluded to, as is a strong bond with Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), an eccentric yet understanding young girl. His enemy, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), remains a force to be reckoned with. But his connection to Ron and Hermione has and always will be the strongest. It was a pleasure to see them continue to develop, both as friends and as individuals. There's a moment when Hermione says, ""It's quite exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?"" ""Who are you, and what have you done with Hermione Granger?"" is Ron's reply, which I found amusing. Up until then, he only knew her as a perfect student, always keeping her nose stuck in a textbook, flaunting her intelligence to both students and professors.<br /><br />As with all the other ""Harry Potter"" films, ""Order of the Phoenix"" features a number of well-established British actors. These include: Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape, Richard Griffiths as Uncle Vernon, Fiona Shaw as Aunt Petunia, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. David Thewlis, Emma Thompson, Warwick Davis, and Jason Isaacs also reprise their roles. Helena Bonham Carter joins the cast as Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius' evil Death Eater cousin. All add dimension to the story without becoming overbearing, which is good because room was needed for special effects, all of which are incredible.<br /><br />Yes, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a top-notch movie, despite its dark tone. Having read the sixth book, I can only say that the next film adaptation will be even darker, which may be problematic for some viewers. Many--myself included--have to accept that the wondrous atmosphere of Chris Columbus' original film has long since developed into something denser, less innocent. But in no way does it lack any of the imagination or style that brought the original story to life. This is a thoroughly entertaining film, full of magic and surging with energy."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"When I saw the price for this item, I thought ""WOAH! A Harry Potter blu-ray/DVD combo with a Digital Copy for THIS price?! My lucky day!"" I purchased it right away and the quality of the product was fantastic! I suggest if you buy a copy of this movie, you get this edition!"
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" adopts a menacing tone as the Voldemort spreads his influence over the wizarding world. After Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and cousin Dudley are attacked by dementors, the life-sucking creatures that guard Azkaban prison, Harry is whisked away to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization sworn to combat the forces of the Dark Lord. Soon he is back at Hogwarts School, having barely escaped expulsion for the underage use of magic in self-defense. But defamatory press against his allies and protectors, the insistence by well-meaning adults that Harry be kept in the dark about matters that most concern him, and a new insidious Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), put Harry in a persistently foul mood. If that were not enough, Harry is plagued by visions of Voldemort's scourge.<br /><br />The most fun in the Harry Potter movies is often found in the extravagant behavior of Hogwarts teachers, and ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" pulls another coup on that front. Megalomania has never been so entertaining as when coupled with Delores Umbridge's sweetness and pastels. The film doesn't make light of the dire situation suffered by students and staff. Umbridge's spying and prying at Hogwarts is a thinly veiled Inquisition. Her efforts to stamp out individualism through Draconian policies are condemned as products of fear and egotism. A stark message made more than palatable by Imelda Staunton's gift for caricature. Evanna Lynch gives an especially charming performance among the students, as the eccentric, spacey Luna Lovegood. A new set, the interior of the Ministry of Magic is eye-catching but too CGI for my taste. The movie isn't as brooding as the book, but a shadow is unmistakably spreading over the wizarding world."
B00447G29S	4.0	b	"I saw the movie in an IMAX theatre and enjoyed it a great deal.  I'm a 60 year old man who watched the House of Wax, Charge at Feather River, Hondo, etc., in 3D when they first were released, in the 1950s.  I love the process and am happy that more movies are getting duplicated in 3D for the big screen...and the little ones too.<br /><br />The description, for both the standard and Blu-Ray version, states:  ""The version of the film on DVD is the standard theatrical version, not the 3-D version seen in IMAX theaters. --David Horiuchi""<br /><br />The term ""3D"" is set out, on the DVD box, in larger font than the name of the movie, but Amazon includes the claim that it's a flat version, and nowhere refers to it as ""including glasses"" as it does for ""Journey to the Center of the Earth.""<br /><br />I'm not buying until I know...but, it is a really good movie."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	nice movie to watch, I encourage parents to let their kids watch this fascinating movie. My kids love how the cars interact, talk and they like adventure parts in this movie.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	This is a great movie, great story along with acting. Highly recommend this to ppl With a scifi thriller taste.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"This is the first Scorsese film I have really enjoyed since 1995's Casino.  All the performances are great, but the real standout here is Jack Nicholson's psychotic mob boss.  The documentary about the real life events upon which the movie was based are useful to viewers who want to find out more about the real life events that inspired certain things in the movie and with the documentary included I consider this edition to be the ""complete"" version of the film.<br /><br />Ivan Rorick"
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	If you have or have not read the book, you must have the DVD!  This is the book series that started children reading again.  Add this DVD to your home library to inspire the creative centers of the brain with fantasy.  Beautifull done and a must to see.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I bought this and Arguing with myself. Arrived quickly for non-stop laughs. I've never been disappointed in anything I've bought from Amazon.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"Amazon tends to lump the reviews for all the different versions of the product together. This review is for the DVD version.<br /><br />The movie is fine and the audio is great, but the video transfer is absolutely the worst I have ever seen. Or, not seen, if you catch my drift: even with the lights out at night in a perfectly dark room, the first 1/3 of the movie is completely unwatchable. It's not just that the movie is dark, it's that the movie is lacking any sort of brightness at all.<br /><br />On my TV, the movie looks like it was shot in dense, black fog. I was keenly disappointed, since the deleted scenes looked fine.<br /><br />I have a Panasonic plasma TV and a Sony DVD player. Neither piece of equipment could be considered cheap or low-end. The difference between the picture and anything else I have ever put into the DVD player is like, er, night and day.<br /><br />I played around with the menus on the DVD player, and could not find any unusual settings. And although I performed some experiments (turning progressive mode off, fiddling with the black level, and the cinema modes), nothing I did made any real improvement to the picture.<br /><br />Since not everyone who bought this item is complaining about the poor video quality (although quite a few people are), I'm not sure if this is a quality control issue, or if the studio made some technical decisions about how to compress the video that only show up on certain players and TVs. You would think that Warner's would know what it is doing. Presumably, so does Sony, who invented the DVD format (along with Phillips).<br /><br />I put the disk into the DVD drive on my desktop computer, and the picture looked fine. The movie was dark, but you could see what was going on. I suppose I can watch the rest of the movie that way. My computer monitor is significantly smaller than my TV, but at least I can enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps the title of the review should have been, ""Are You Feeling Lucky?"" Because it's going to take a bit of luck on your part to get a DVD that's actually watchable. Judging from the other reviews, about 10 to 15% of us are having problems watching this DVD.<br /><br />p.s., the real ""extras"" on this disk are the interminable parade of ads for other HP products you are forced to wade through before you can arrive at the main menu.<br /><br />UPDATE: The fact that the disk played tolerably well on my computer led me to suspect that (gasp!) my TV might need adjusting. I had several DVDs in my video library that included the TXH optimizer, which is probably the simplest way to check your TV setup. Sure enough, the Picture/Contrast setting was too low, and the Brightness was so poor, I couldn't even begin to make the necessary adjustment!<br /><br />Some scouring on the internet got me the secret formula for entering Service Mode on my Panasonic TV. I found the menu for brightness, and boosted things until I could actually see the TXH drop shadow. Once I exited the service menu, I had to tweak the Black setting on the TV, and then I was able to finish the THX optimizer adjustments, including color and tint (you'll be needing special blue glasses for this last step, order them from the TXH consumer web page).<br /><br />Bottom line: it was my TV, not the disk.<br /><br />However, it would have been a lot easier all around if Warner's had included a test screen on the DVD. They wouldn't have had to include the TXH optimizer (I'm sure there's some sort of licencing fee invoved), but they could have had a test pattern that said something to the effect of, ""if you don't see all ten levels of black on the next screen, you need to adjust your set!""<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this was the ONLY DVD I've found to be too dark. But everything is better now, and I've adjusted my rating accordingly.<br /><br />p.s., THX has a list of DVDs that include the THX optimizer. Search the internet and you will find them. One of my favorites is ""Tombstone."" Another is ""The Man Who Fell To Earth"". The entire Indiana Jones series includes them, as do quite a few titles from Anchor Bay. Chances are, you already have one or more of them in your DVD collection. If this disk is too dark on your TV, it's probably time to adjust your set!"
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	Before my critique, let me say this is by far my favorite Potter film. Everything about it, from story to characters, is fantastic. I was thrilled when I read about the extras, especially the Maximum Movie Mode which has pop-ups that tell you information about the making of the film and the story behind the story.<br />THIS is where things go wrong, at least on my copy. The Maximum Movie Mode is filled with glitches. Some clips have NO AUDIO, others freeze while still others pop-up 5 seconds before a break in the story, which would make a logical place for an explanation to be offered. I'm not sure if this is an issue with just my copy or a loss of product quality because the Blu-Ray/DVD was rushed out for money making purposes.<br />Again the movie is great, IT plays fine. However, the technical glitches are infuriating.
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"My official rating for this movie is a 3 stars out of 5. My review is full of spoilers so don't read if you haven't seen it. Prometheus is one of those movies that is hyped beyond expectation, literally. The hype for this movie was too high, and unfortunately left many disappointed. I didn't have any real expectation or idea of what the movie was going to be like, but I was pleasantly surprised of how good this movie is. The acting is superb from all actors. The main character, Shaw, really gave this movie that needed thrill and horror factor. Shaw goes through absolutely hell before she gets off that damn planet. She survived an attack against a 8ft tall humanoid, and had to surgically remove an alien feeding off of her womb while conscious. While she tries to survive with a stapled stomach. Noomi really gave us that amazing acting to give us anxiety and make us cringe of the horrors she was going through. All characters had their own personality. Charlize was pure evil, but her evil is more of a survival instinct. The ""space jockey"" is really creepy and demonic looking, which makes ""him"" look really intimidating and scary, which is the point. The visuals are amazing and huge in scale. I paid attention to certain details of the characters. For example, Shaw was a believer in God, and it was very interesting how battling against an alien made her faith in God even stronger. I am excited of how the home world of the ""space jockey""/aliens will look like, and what the next explorers or Shaw will discover. My favorite elements of the movie are the small things in the characters, like Shaw's faith, and how the captain of prometheus was really dedicated to not transport death to earth, and how charlize's character is somewhat mean and cold because her father treated her that same way. Very good movie, and may not be for everyone. A solid 3 stars."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I originally saw this on TV. I loved it so much that I bought my own copy. It's a good thing I did, because the un-edited show is so much better. This DVD allows you to choose between edited and un-edited. Also, the bonus features are great. Jeff Dunham is probably the most talented comedian out there right now.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"My family and peers believe that a story needs to be in a good movie. This action flick just didn't seem to be driving in that direction. It feels like one of those old 1960s films, a slice of ""real"" life. Yeah right...<br />It felt like it wanted to be Thelma & Louise. It wasn't. It seemed like it was running for a little Silence of The Lambs action, it missed. It's too bad the writers didn't take their script through a few more editorial sessions. Just not for us."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	They are more realistic then ever. They have drama and curse words and sex and unhappy endings. Just like real life. I've been told I have great taste in movies from a lot of people, friends & family & some people I just met. I read some of the 1 star reviews about this movie. Most of those reviews are stupid people who are picky. One was even mad that the main star in this movie has sex with random women. Big deal! If they have little kids and don't want them to see this movie then don't let them see it. problem solved, I mean have good parenting skills people. It's called common sense! Other people were saying this movie was only special effects. So what that's what makes action movies great. The acting and comedy was there too. I thought it was a kickass movie. Even scientist are trying to make people super human in the future. They gear up are soldiers in iraq pretty hardcore. We can see and shoot around corners without even steping out in dangerous situations.<br />Iron man and the hulk and batman and wanted were all good movies. They made their millions and you see more 5 and 4 star votes on here then you do 1 star soo you know most people liked this movie.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"The original movive, ""Infernal Affairs"", is better than ""The Best Moive"" of this 79th Oscar."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie is really cute and kept my 4 year old and 2 year old entertained. It has nothing scary in it, which is hard to find these days.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I think this is another great movie in the series and Amazon made it very easy for me to get it and it came in a very timely manner
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	I have wanted to see this movie since it came out.  I was a bit disappointed.  The story line was refreshing because it was different than any I have seen or read but it was missing substance, too many holes to fill.  Overall it was watchable but not that good.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />Although able to spark a significant <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ONE"">Indiana Jones</a> sense of nostalgia, and add a possible newcomer to the ranks of what might be future Indiana Jones films, there's not much else to Spielberg's latest adventure film ...except an ending that harkens back to the not-so-good <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXP"">Artificial Intelligence</a> film.<br /><br />Understandably Spielberg was waiting for the perfect script, but Harrison Ford wasn't getting any younger, so it is my assumption that Spielberg took the leap and decided to direct a so-so film rather than let Ford's character forever fall into obscurity. The film itself isn't necessarily so-so, but the concept and ending are not, shall we say, in keeping with the Indiana Jones film mentality.<br /><br />Although I'm no Harrison Ford fan, I did enjoy his early work on such films as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW"">Star Wars</a>, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBMWG4"">Blade Runner</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322737X"">American Graffiti</a>. His later work became mundane and unexceptional, myself only being able to see Harrison Ford playing Harrison Ford and not the character(s) I was supposed to see. But the Indian Jones series was an entirely different ball-game. Funny. Action-packed. Historically ...strange. And just fun to watch. These are the things that make for entertaining cinema. And although this fourth installment in the Indiana Jones films carries many of those items, it does not carry it all the way to its newfound ending.<br /><br />And speaking of newfound, Shia LaBeouf (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KB489I"">A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</a>) as Mutt Williams, Indiana's spawn and possible successor, was a very good idea. He's cocky, strangely funny, and enough not like Indy to make the character believable. The sword fights on top of careening cars as they travel through the jungle and disrupt his testicular fortitude were just the right amount of zany action and ridiculous comedy that needed infusing into the story.<br /><br />Nostalgic-wise, the incorporation of Indiana and his love for his hat are immediately taken to heart as we witness him being ripped from the trunk of a car by communists, the main one being Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067DNF"">The Lord of the Rings</a>), a sword-carrying and tough spy in the likes of actor Paul Freeman who played Rene Belloq in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU"">The Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>. Most Indy fans will also be very happy to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion, Indiana Jones' love interest from the first film. Although the years show heavily on Mrs. Allen, she's still spunky enough to give a fine performance.<br /><br />Lovers of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016GLZW4"">original score</a> will also be happy how it was folded into this latest release, portions of the music being liberally sprinkled throughout the story. The filming used for Indiana Jones 4 did not use digital cameras, so the original style can also be seen and felt by the viewing audience.<br /><br />Where the story begins to crumble, however, is in the storyline that reuses old themes from the Raiders film (anyone who looks at or knows what they shouldn't is wiped off the planet), and adds Spielberg's heavy-handed sense of science fiction that helped destroy the end of the aforementioned Artificial Intelligence movie (""It's a portal to another realm!"") The crystal skull(s) also just seemed like a key to a puzzle that easily could've been solved by anyone, not just the supposedly adept Jones (and his new prodigy). Which makes the ""alien"" ending seem all the more ludicrous.<br /><br />My assumption is that Hollywood and Spielberg himself think that audiences need something bigger, better, and more spectacular than the last. That's not necessarily true, especially when dealing with nostalgic cinema the likes of Indiana Jones. Audiences will come because they want that old timey feel, not something bigger, better, and more ""alien"" than before.<br /><br />Regardless of this film's failings, it is entertaining. The action is practically nonstop throughout its 124 minute length, making it seem shorter than it actually was. That's something, I guess."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Notice the number of one star reviews.  This is direct proof of the premise of this movie - many scientists can't accept anything that challenges evolution.<br /><br />I am a mathematics professor at a large university.  It is simply true that challenges to evolution are disallowed, often attacked, and often the people doing the challenging are cast off by the elite.  You can't have good science without open challenge to current theory, and the stonewalling over evolution debate is in my opinion the biggest scientific failure of our generation.  Many people are debating the minutia of this movie, but it all comes down to the evolution debate.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	THIS WAS JUST WELL ROUNDED FUN MOVIE AND I DIDN'T WANT TO GO FOR POPCORN ONCE AFTER IT STARTED.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"I have to say I loved this movie as much as I did the book when I was young.  This is a simple heartwarming story about Christmas spirit and believing in Santa.  Please take this movie at face value and you will enjoy it much more.  As far as santa looking like a prophet...he is simply ""designed"" to look like the actor who does his voice, nothing more.<br /><br />My 2 1/2 year old loved this story and was particularly fond of the train animation and the great music.  I for one ADORED the mix of both OLD and NEW christmas songs.  We could not have asked for a better Christmas time movie!"
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"A hunter named Moss (Josh Brolin) in the Texas desert discovers a drug deal gone bad and decides to try and keep the $2Million cash he finds, which as expected, entangles him in the mess of those who want to recover the money. Seems like a promising story, except that, while suspenseful, it veers sideways into meaningless subplots/characters and gratuitous murder scenes--the point was amply made that Chigurh (Javier Bardem) was a psychopathic killer, so I suppose the Coen brothers were using additional killings as filler material. I won't spoil the end of the movie, but will say that it's anti-climactic and defeatist. Some say this is an artsy ""realism"". Umm, no. Reality would have involved more police/SWAT, etc. and not have happened in apparent isolation, would not be so stylized, and it would have been more conclusive. As for the movie's artistry, I'll just say that anything passes for ""art"" these days, with enough hype behind it. Those audience members titillated by Chigurh's cold-blooded murders of innocent bystanders have their own issues. This is not a philosophical film about fate (but I'll address fan boys' assertions below), so please don't try to elevate it beyond bloodsport and greed and those caught in their path. The overall tone of the film suggests terror, gloom, and helplessness and falls off with a lack of resolution, which simply becomes tiresome. There is no real point to this story. Apparently, while very dark, the novel was much better and less disjointed and incomplete--bad editing on the directors' part. This movie is pretentious drivel. Don't waste your money or your time on this film, which belongs in the trash heap. Laughably bad comic-book antics.<br /><br />To understand why Coen brothers films, such as Fargo, O Brother Where Art Thou?, and No Country for Old Men, resonate with many members of the Academy and some audience members, start by browsing Wikipedia for nihilism, post-modernism and deconstructionism, which all begin with elitism and moral relativism and employ sophistry to further muddy the water. Methods used by these self-crowned elitists include undermining common values by attacking the words used in their reasoning, by dissecting words, in isolation, like the implied ""fate"" or ""free will"" in this story, and not in their proper context--check definitions of a word in the Oxford English Dictionary, and you'll see that language is necessarily contextual. In essence, the ""common man"" (or average American, in this case) and his morality is regarded as no better than cattle (see Chigurh's heartless execution of innocents with a slaughterhouse piston, and the stylized attention given by the movie's directors to the executions) (also see how they similarly dehumanize normal people by using caricatures in Fargo and O Brother--the directors apparently sneer down upon average Americans, given their movie choices and screen writing, direction and editing). In No Country, Chigurh is challenged at the end by Moss' wife, who insists that the coin toss is not a matter of fate, but rather that it is Chigurh's decision to use the coin toss that determines whether he shoots her or not. He understands this perfectly well, but rejects this because it spoils his executioner's game, using sophism (a diversion/non-sequitor) to explain that the coin arrived there the same way he did--sorry, but he had the choice to come there, and the coin did not. Dumb argument (illogical, but convenient for the executioner). O Brother, Where Art Thy Brain? People may not control every outcome (there are external factors, of course), but an individual's outcomes are largely determined by an individual's choices.<br /><br />A quick Google search for articles on how violence is used in films and Hollywood's and elitists' double-standard for the appropriateness of violence yielded this: http://stkarnick.com/blog2/2008/02/the_violent_hypocrisy_of_mains.html<br /><br />Raise your standards for entertainment. You'll be glad you did."
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	Jeff Dunham is very talented and funny!  I am in love with Walter and Peanut!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My four and a half year old son thinks this is the best movie ever!  It isn't bad for Mom and Dad to watch either.  Overall we love it.
B002VRZEYM	3.0	b	Couldn't watch the whole movie because it was too boring. They just made the same point over and over and over.....
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	A great action movie and great effects!  Downey jr is perfect as Tony Stark, i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will buy it for Blu Ray...one of the best of the summer!
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	First off i adore the books. I've watched all the harry potter films because as bad as they are, i want to see what they did to it and i wasnt disappointed. This movie has so much fodder people were tripping over it in the theater aisles. Knowing that this was the longest book in the series some things were bound to be omitted. But the screenwriters keep making the same mistake. They cut out parts of the book that lead one to the other. This movie was extremely short but it doesnt feel like it. I kept looking at my watch and being surpriseed 2 hours hadnt passed. I'm a diehard of the books so i'm not going to be pleased completely but that doesnt mean i can't find it watchable. I enjoyed the 3rd movie immensely but it just gets worse when the books get darker and darker. Heres hoping they dont ruin the final 2 movies.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Bought this for my son.  He and I enjoyed watching this together.  Lots of action.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"Everything is in this title. But they had to change it at the last moment for copyright infringements reasons.<br /><br />The title ""Prometheus"" may actually be the only thing they didn't cut & paste from another previous story, if you except the Greek mythology that's been going on for a while now (like 4000 years or so). Seriously it felt like re-heated food from a couple of days (maybe weeks) ago. A constant sense of ""deja-vu"" spoiled every single moment of the film, with reoccurring ""subtle"" references to Alien(s), and other films of the same kind. I mean forced feeding references, like a good alien would do, you know what I mean...<br /><br />Talking about food, I guess the only thing that they didn't dare to do in this grotesque farce, was to cook an alien just for fun ""to see how it tastes"". They actually came close to it by having a team member drink some alien goo without reason in a cocktail!! Jackass, here I am!! The team of dumb scientists is absolutely irresistible, I have to admit. But not in a multi-billion production like this. Maybe if the film would have been made by a group of sexually depraved high school students with their mobile phones, it would have been an interesting concept. Not here sorry...<br /><br />I have to say that this film creates a category of its own, mixing top notch CGI, low grade trash, Z series sci-fi, tainted comedy, gory horror, and (cough) hyper cheap phi-lo-so-phy. The best of ALL WORLDS!! At the end of the day you get a CGI team who struggled to do its best (and I admit that they achieved well), with a seriously degenerate scenario, terrible acting and, OMG, the worst dialogs of all times, at least since the Earth was colonized by aliens. The dialogs made me wish the film was dubbed in the alien language. I almost suffered head hemorrhages at the vacuity of the phrases. But wait, maybe that's what happened to the alien's head by the way!!<br /><br />Editing, as someone said, is nightmarish, and the argument which consists in saying ""just wait for the director's cut"", makes me puke my (alien) diner in advance. Two hours of this painful joke was way too long already. It's even laughable. In fact even the scientists, the aliens and the android laughed their heads off during the course of the film!!<br /><br />I would have loved to hear what the Great George Carlin (not Lucas) would have had to say about such a ""gross misunderstanding"" of a movie. Personally, I feel sick..."
B000S5KGH4	1.0	b	i just don't see how this guy is funny, unless you were born in the 1800s...  Please stop giving him attention!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I heard this was good.  It was great.<br />Everything I read about it in the main stream media talked about Intelligent Design.  They must not have seen the movie!  It's not about Intelligent Design.  It's about freedom.  It's about hatred.  It's about the dumbing down of America.<br />Talk about dumbing down - it's really kind of scary that someone could see this movie and say it was about Intelligent Design.  And Patton was a movie about tanks; Romeo and Juliet was a movie about England; and The Sound of Music was a movie about nuns and Austrian submarine captains.<br />This movie is a documentary, but it's very different.  It's done in a very warm and personal way, with that dry Ben Stein humor.  The subject matter is very important; important enough to drive him to make this movie and share his thoughts.  This is a must see for every American.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	Other than Rasing Arizona & The Big Lebowski I never been a Coen Brothers fan as I think they are highly over rated. After seeing the abysmall The Ladykillers I vowed never to see another Coen Brothers film, however due to all the postive buzz I decided to give No Country For Old Men a try and I was impressed. Josh Brolin who deserved a Oscar nod for his role in Amercian Gangster shines as Llewelyn Moss as a vietnam veteran who stumbles upon the aftermath of a drugs deal gone wrong in the desert. Watching the film made me recall various Greek tradegy that I read in high school, espically when Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh comes into play. The purusut of Llewlyn by Anton is a nail biting cat & mouse that kept my attention. I think the film deserved all the Oscars it won and I'd love to see what Javier Bardem can do in a big budget action film as a dirty cop. All in all a great film that will get repeated viewings from me.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	By far the funniest comedic performance I've seen in ages!  I shared it with friends during a birthday party, and we all laughed until we ached.  It's not appropriate for kids, but it will leave adults rolling in the floor.  HYSTERICAL!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is a worthwhile film that has all the elements needed to keep men & women interested in the outcome. It does not fail to entertain while also teaching that apart from having a self-sacrificing spouse, most marriages will fail once they hit the rough-sledding that comes after the first few months of romantic love wear thin. The acting is exceptional given all but the star (Kirk Cameron) are amateurs. The script & production rival  Hollywood.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"I thought about watching the movie several times but passed it by because of the two reviews with three stars I'd read. Now I'm glad I went ahead and rented it. I wanted to give it five stars and why I didn't in a bit. First, Charlize Theron...amazing. I enjoyed her more in this movie than any other I've seen her in, especially after ""Young Adult""-I swore I'd dislike her forever due to the character she played (yeah, dumb) and the lousy acting. But in this film, she shined! Her acting and the beautiful and sometimes haunting special effects were mesmerizing. Chris Helmsworth did a stellar job and the dwarves had me rooting for them. Now the reason for the four stars and not five: Kristen Stewart. Her performance was lackluster, boring, phoned-in. She wasn't quite as insipid as she is in the Twilight movies but I had to work up enthusiasm for a character that should have easily inspired me. I agree with that much of the other reviews: Should have gotten someone, ANYone else, to play the part of the princess."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	About the evolution/intelligent design controversy.<br />Styled like a documentary. A real eye-opener about academic<br />freedom, science, etc.  This movie really needs to<br />be seen more than once!! You will get more out of it each time.<br />It has taken a serious subject and put it in a new light....<br />Part serious, part funny, and definitely worth watching!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I have read the books and I must say the first season lives up to it quite well.<br />YES- there is a different direction taken for the supporting characters.. but you have to remember that the book was written in the FIRST person with ONLY Sookie's point of view known to us- so from that we can only imagine what the other characters were doing at the same time.<br />I think HBO did a great job filling in the blanks by giving ALL the characters a story line and their own LIFE.<br />It's OF COURSE going to differ from the books- to add suspense for the avid readers who already know what's going to happen.<br />However I do not feel that Sookie's story line was changed at all.<br /><br />I *LOVE* this show, as well as the books- and I would recommend this series to anyone who loves Vampires!<br /><br />CHECK OUT CHARLAINE HARRIS - Great author who wrote the Sookie Stackhouse Series.
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	I thought that this movie was just okay.  I really love all of the Harry Potter books, and all of the movies.  The Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite book, and the movie didn't have my favorite parts of the book. (of which there were very few) This made the movie very bland and dull.  During the middle, it really dragged.  Although I liked both the beginning and the end (except for the part where Sirius died) the middle part was just too slow.  I am hoping that movie 6 will be much better.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	"The one outstanding feature of this film is that it did not depend upon a soundtrack. It is a visual masterpiece.  However, I really like a good story and the plot did not have enough twists and turns for me.  Casting was perfect. I read another review which stated ""not a movie for the masses.""  I thought that statement was really elitist.  Us average people on the street want to be entertained and we don't mind learning a little something too, but it can't be too subtle.  I was slightly entertained and I really didn't get the themes.  Hmm...maybe it's because I'm one of the masses who pays money to see these movies."
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	I bought this show because I had a friend with similar tastes talk about how wonderful it is.  It is a good show, but in my opinion, it is not the best thing ever.  It's one of those shows where it's good to see once, but I didn't even keep the DVDs after watching them, because I wouldn't watch them again.  It was nice to have the set to watch all the way through one after the other, though.<br />As an added note, I wouldn't recommend watching it around children or adults who are offended by graphic material (and, of course if you are offended by it, I wouldn't recommend you watch it).  There is a lot of sexual content in these shows, and of course some blood and violence, too.<br />Overall, a good show, but I would recommend buying it used or on sale.  I know I got one season on sale for about 15 dollars at some point.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is an awesome workout!  I would say it's a little more than insane to begin with, but once you get rolling, it's really a rush to see how you can transform yourself and really pretty much just whip yourself into shape in a short period of time.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie is a great time for kids of all ages- including mom and dad.  Not only did my kids appreciate humor- but there are lots of subtle adult markings for all ages.  The music is catchy and Disney did a great job.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is a must see movie for any couple. Strong marriages can become stronger and more grateful for their spouse. Weak marriages can become strong by applying the principles from this movie.<br /><br />Excellent story, excellent quality. Drama, humor, suspense, faith, love all packed into this movie that flows well and edifies the soul.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Overall it was enjoyable to watch knowing we were watching a dark tale.  I thought the imagery surrounding the wicked Queen Ravenna was done well (her whole look gets darker as the movie progresses) and some of the effects were interesting, such as the mirror and when she transformed back into human form from her ravens.  I felt there were several areas the story didn't explain too well, like when Snow White asked the Huntsman to escort her to the Duke.  It took me awhile to actually figure out who that was supposed to be (and why was he so far away?).  I mean, I knew William and his father got away, but I didn't know he was the Duke.  Hubby thought William was her brother initially.... And as beautiful as the animal gathering scene was in the sanctuary, it was not well explained either.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything, but I lacked closure at the end of the movie!  I have no idea if Snow White knew who's kiss woke her up or which guy she chooses (she has to pick one, right?!).  The visual aspect was great but the story and characters could have been built up more.  It was probably the first time I didn't really feel connected to Snow White.  I didn't feel strongly when she was poisoned.  Really the only character I came to care about was the Hunstman!  The movie lacked the depth and character development I prefer, but it was still enjoyable to watch.  I still need to see the extended version - maybe I will like that better?<br /><br />*I received a copy of the bluray combo pack to review.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Not one I'd choose to see again. Poor dialogue with weak and obvious special effects telling the story in a way that seems formulaic.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I'm a fan of all the movies and all the books, so I'm biased in favor of most of the various productions.  I LOVED THIS MOVIE AS MUCH AS ANY HARRY POTTER PRODUCT.  I CAN BARELY BELIEVE HOW EXTRAVAGANT THIS MOVIE FEELS.  I'VE READ COMPLAINTS: LONGEST BOOK / SHORTEST MOVIE---BUT IT DID NOT FEEL SHORT.  THIS MOVIE HAS PROVED ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITES.  ENJOY.  DON'T IMAGINE IT MUST BE THE BOOK.  READ THE BOOK AGAIN TO GET THE BOOK!!! (And what a delight Luna Lovegood is.  WHAT a great character; and, WHAT a find in Evanna Lynch.  Talk about the character coming to life!!!  What a sweet heart.  Destined for the role, like virtually all those cast in these films.)<br /><br />Sorry for all the capital letters, I'm just sad this film is getting beaten up for not being longer.  The film is packed with gems. Did I mention I LOVE THIS FILM?  Yeah, I'm a fan.  What can I say?!<br /><br />Bill Hoover<br />Evergreen, Colorado
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is the hardest workout i have ever done, and I am a dance teacher. I have yet to make it through an entire dvd, but i am on my way. If you are up for the challenge get it!!
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	Charlize was the only good actor in this movie. It was obviously the first movie for this director. I don't know why he had such a ig movie for his first.... Really failed.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"4 1/2 Stars = Minor Marerpiece<br /><br />Coming from a guy who went to see the first Alien film in the theater, to seeing it to many times to count afterwards. Wanting to try to figure out all the ambiguities of that film, & it was very ambiguous, with no clues about the xenomorph & the alien spaceship, & where they came from. So, all I have to say about ""Prometheus"" is, without giving it all away:<br /><br />Genius, pure, genius! It answered all my questions about the first film, then some! It also created more ambiguities, but that's the charm of many great films, leaving the viewer wanting more. Just like life, there is never no complete answers on where you'll be tomorrow, what will happen to you after you die, or who is responsible for life on the grand scale. So goes ""Prometheus,"" for it can't answer those questions either, but it does make you wonder.<br /><br />A new chapter has been born, one that leaves room for other, maybe more intriquing chapters to come, full of more ambiguous questions for the next film to explain?<br /><br />Quite the accomplishment, Mr. Scott!"
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"I love Jeff Dunham's ""Arguing With Myself"". I really appreciated the option of choosing the ""G"" rated, edited version for family viewing, the ""R"" rated version was pretty funny too. I am looking forward to more from Jeff Dunham."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Iron Man is one of those all too rare big budget movies that actually delivers. Downey was born to play Tony Stark but the real hero of this movie is the screenplay. A well written story, great charactors and terrific special effects.<br /><br />The film is about Tony Stark. The son of Howard Stark, also a genius. Tony inherits the company from his father when his father dies. He's basically partners with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges who also played the part brilliantly). Stark Industries is known for producing military weapons that, according to Tony, needs to be used only once to end a war. Tony soon finds himself captive of an Afghan rebel group that want his weapons made for them, because whoever owns his weapons, basically wins the war. Tony creates the classic Iron Man suit to get out of the captives hands and once he does, Tony decides he doesn't want to create weapons anymore. He wants to create things to help the world, not destroy it. The rest of the owners of Stark Industries isn't to happy with this and they decide to, basically, just not listen to Tony anymore. While Tony's company is basically doing whatever they want, Tony is in his mansion revamping his original build of his suit. Not to ruin anything about the story, lets just say Tony is about to put his new suit into some good usage.<br /><br />Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation but it is darn close. It holds Downey's best performance in a long time. It is a fun, comic actioner that sure comes close to a ""perfect film"". I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years. Highly recommended."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	We have enjoyed all of the Comedy Central TV specials and were pleased that there is so much more on the DVD's to enjoy. I bought all 3 DVD's and I plan on buying the talking Peanut and Achmed dolls when they become available.  I have enjoyed this DVD the most out of the ones that have come out so far, I loan it to all my friends and relatives who are unfamilair with Jeff Dunham so they can enjoy it as well.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I admit that I avoided it in the theatre.  Partially because I was annoyed that Pixar was bought out by Disney and the fact my girl is noise sensitive and would have gotten upset over the race scenes and the noise involved.<br /><br />While getting a haircut for her, they had it playing.  I decided to buy it after she was done.<br /><br />As typical to Pixar it's a great story about about a self absorbed up and coming race car named Lightning McQueen (named after Steve McQueen).<br /><br />Lightning thinks he can do everything by himself and it comes back on him as he ignores advice and ends up in a 3-way tie in a race he should have won.  He has to head out to California for a race off between the 3 winners and eventually gets lost and ends up on the forgotten roads of Route 66.  He panics and ends up destroying the streets of the forgotten town of Radiator Springs.  He is caught and his punishment is to repair the roads.<br /><br />There he finds many characters.  Doc Hudson (Paul Neuman) who may have a secret past, Tow Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) the simple happy go lucky tow truck, and of course a nice Girl Porsche Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) who is a dreamer and longs for what the town used to be.<br /><br />Along the way Lightning makes friends with the town people.  Mater being the best friend.  He helps the improve itself and they help him start thinking about other people.<br /><br />The movie has a well rounded cast with the efforts of Tony Shalhoub, Cheeh marin, John Ratzenburger, Michel Keaton, George Carlin, and cameos by others.<br /><br />There are two shorts, One Man Band and Mater and the Ghostlight.  I lost count on how many times my girl had to watch them!<br /><br />There are deleted scenes which are drawing form.<br /><br />There is a short by John Lasseter called Inspiration For Cars.  He takes you on a trip on Route 66 and you can see where stuff came from in the movie!  You even get to meet the real life Mater!<br /><br />I am happy with this purchase and I HOPE Disney leaves them alone!
B00447G29S	4.0	b	This is not a movie about Santa Claus but a metaphor for belief in God.  Santa was hardly the merry person seen in just about every other Christmas movie ever made.  He didn't even look like Santa.  He looked more like an old testament prophet in a red suit.<br /><br />The North Pole was one of the weirdest places I've ever seen depicted.  It was a far cry from Rudolph's North Pole where the elves sang all the time.  Why all the disembodied recordings?  Was there no money left over for original Christmas music?  Didn't look like Heaven either.  It made me think more of the Catholic Limbo, somewhere between life and death.  If I were one of those kids, I'd want to get out of there quick.  Even 3-D didn't help.<br /><br />Not that movie wasn't fun.  The kids were all good.  The boy and girl heroes were born leaders.  The obnoxious kid with the glasses really made me laugh.  Billy, the sad kid, was suitably mysterious.  Wonder what was in his package?  The scene where they served the hot chocolate was my favorite.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie I'd like to see again.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Great movie. It's even better in HD. I love the extra footage. I can't wait for Sin City 2. :-)
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I know some of the detractors of this latest Rowling adaptation have valid points but in my opinion Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is not just a great Harry Potter movie, it is a great movie, period. The makers of the film successfully synthesized the longest Potter novel of the seven and constructed a 138-minute motion picture that moves along through its action without leaving out plot details that made the 2003 novel the wonderfully shadowy read it was. Daniel Radcliffe has grown immeasurably as an actor, as have the other younger cast members, and John Williams' score has never sounded so fitting or so possessing. A strong balance was struck in this outing between atmospheric visuals and dialogue, something sometimes unreached in the last four Harry Potter movies, despite the fact that they, too, were classics. The final sequence wherein Dumbledore and Voldemort wage a wizards' battle was a special effects tsunami that swept aside all disbelief and left everyone I know convinced that should they ever truly witness two wizards in combat, it would look exactly like that! I've seen the Order of the Phoenix three times at the theaters, and still can't wait for the DVD. It is the closest thing to a trip into a magical world we can ever hope to have. Now bring on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I'm ready!
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"This revised verdict contains SPOILERS:<br /><br />This High Court finds the accused guilty of:<br /><br />1) disappointing the expectations of large numbers of devoted fans and admirers<br />2) soiling his own legacy<br />3) dumping garbage in theatres around the world<br />4) insulting the intelligence of the viewers<br />5) wasting the talent of good actors<br />6) robbing defenceless Engineers of the totality of their ""cool"" factor<br />7) wagging his 3D in public, in a crowded area, without any valid reason<br />8) using office staples in medicine<br />9) causing waste of perfectly good popcorn in a world where hundreds of millions do not have enough to eat<br /><br />Justification: A LOT was expected from ""Prometheus"". It is however the finding of this Court that this film failed to meet the required standards to such a point, that it is at best an average SF film, many quality levels beneath ""Alien"" and in fact not even as good as ""Alien3""... This Court finds particularly reprehensive the fact, that Sir Ridley Scott, one of the greatest directors alive, accepted a piss-poor scenario, which, unlike in his masterpieces (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Blackhawk Down"", etc.) doesn't make any sense. This Court rejects with extreme energy the argument of the defense, that the scenarist is responsible for this film fiasco. The director is the person really in charge of the film and therefore the responsibility is all his, for everything, including the scenario. Also, as the scenarist is currently hiding in his own butt and refuses to come out (understandable under the circumstances), his testimony couldn't be heard - and therefore the whole point is considered moot and irrelevant for the present proceedings.<br /><br />This Court finds particularly offensive to common sense that the whole idea of First Contact with intelligent aliens was wasted and played at the level of a B-class ""direct to DVD"" SF film. It can be resumed briefly - an intelligent entity, belonging to a race which could fly interstellar spaceships already at least tens of thousands years ago, wakes up and sees smaller creatures, clearly intelligent because they obviously made it out of their solar system. So what does it do? It doesn't even try to communicate, but just starts to rip them apart. This Court allows itself here the right to laugh its (---) off, but with much underlying sadness.<br /><br />As a mitigating circumstance, this Court finds that there is a possibility that this deplorable scene was caused by the android David messing up the communications. The android seems to have learned alien's language from ancient human inscriptions - which certainly did not include phonetics (this is why NOBODY today can say with certainty how the Latin was REALLY spoken). So it may be that what the alien heard from the android was in fact: ""I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster and your father smells of elderberries"". Which would explain everything... All doubts being considered in favour of the accused, those mitigating circumstances will be duly weighted at the sentencing, below.<br /><br />There can be however no mitigating circumstances concerning another weakness of the scenario, namely the fact that a mission which cost Weyland Corporation a trillion of dollars is manned by a bunch of total IDIOTS! This Court reminds here, that the crew of ""Nostromo"", made just of hard working blue collar people, acted with much more logic, caution and discipline than the 17 crew members of ""Prometheus"", who are for most part simply pathetic. This Court acknowledges however, that captain Janek, pilot Chance, navigator Ravel and medical officer Ford are - to some extent - exceptions here.<br /><br />In the interest of justice, this Court presents here some most blatant examples of above mentioned idiocy:<br /><br />- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission - so the first time you see an alien skellington you panic and run like crazy away from others!<br />- you were selected to be part of a trillion dollars interstellar mission, because you are a renowned biologist - so the first time the guy next to you sees an alien skellington, panics and runs away like crazy, you scream like a little girl and run after him, so you can get lost together in a maze of dark underground galleries (even if it is YOU who have the only map)...<br />- on a planet able to support life you find an alien underground complex and the atmosphere is OK! Let's all take off our helmets, so we can inhale all the local bacteria, viruses and other stuff against which we have no immunity!<br />- a living creature, vaguely snakelike, appears and approaches - let's give it our hand immediately, after all this is how we handle cobras and vipers on our planet - and I should know, I am a biologist!<br />- oops, I am contaminated by an alien organism and there are already little tentacles growing out of my eye - as I am an educated person with a PhD, I will not say one word about it, I absolutely want this thing to develop until I can not be saved anymore; also let's contaminate the others, after all, Mum always told me it is nice to share!<br />- a guy who was missing for 24 hours signals his presence at the spaceship entry - let's not even have ONE LOOK at him, like for example to see if it is REALLY him, BEFORE opening the doors!<br />- two of my people are stranded in a weird underground complex and there are signs appearing that there is SOMETHING alive inside. Should I maintain regular contact and keep a careful watch over them until they are recovered? Naah! Let's just get drunk and get laid, they will be surely fine... And anyway there is no manpower for this, there is only 15 people left on board...<br />- last but not least, on a trillion dollar interstellar mission on a planet which can support life (and therefore presence of predators can be expected) the whole arsenal on board consists of one shotgun, one handgun and two little flamethrowers - and therefore at some moments it will be down to knives, axes and wrenches...<br /><br />Idiocy being contagious, it is the finding of this Court that the giant aliens a.k.a. Engineers, also caught it:<br /><br />- I am a supremely intelligent ancient life form; I wake up from cryogenic sleep and see facing me five smaller, but clearly intelligent life forms; because I am evil and aggressive I wish to destroy them; of course it doesn't matter that I am alone here and unarmed, and there may be a hundred other small life forms waiting outside, packing heat; it doesn't matter that there is their whole SPACESHIP somewhere outside, which definitely must be packing REAL heat (if only for its propulsive system and mass); it doesn't matter that for all I know there can be a whole FLEET of spaceships on the orbit - no, I am going after them with my bare hands, without collecting the slightest intelligence, without even trying to find some weapons, maybe wake up some reinforcements. Tens of thousands of years of brilliant intelligence development = charge at sight and fight bare handed!<br />- I am a suppremely intelligent ancient life form and my spaceship was just downed by those pesky small life forms; it appears that one of them is still alive and hiding in a small sized but sophisticated container; I want to kill this life form! Should I find a weapon? Use the equipements of my ship which still function to scan the alien container and check for booby traps or weaponry? Go find another spaceship and use its weaponry to vaporize the intruder? No! The correct answer is to charge blindly towards the alien container, with my bare hands, without even having a look for any possible traps or surprises.<br /><br />This Court admits that the casting was made skilfully, but many actors were underused. Idriss Elba (captain Janek) plays very well a tough and brave man - but his screen time is surprisingly limited! Charlize Theron looks in this film as a goddess - frankly, at some moments this Court almost had the impression that looking at her hurt this Court's eyes, so beautiful she is. Her character (Meredith Vickers, mission supervisor) is IMPRESSIVE - but again, the scenario mostly leaves the lead to others and her part in the second part of the film is especially disappointing. Guy Pearce plays Peter Weyland, the CEO and owner of the redoubtable Weyland Corporation. But Peter Weyland is a venerable, truly ancient old man - and Guy Pearce is not, which forces him to wear SO OBVIOUSLY a silly rubber mask! Why Sir Ridley couldn't hire just an old actor (there must be some in Hollywood), is beyond this Court's ability to understand - and forgive.<br /><br />An even more serious charge concerns messing with elements linking ""Prometheus"" to ""Alien"". The Engineers, mysterious giant humanoids furtively suggested in the alien spaceship wreck in ""Alien"" (the giant skeleton sitting in the chair), were a very promising thing for more than 30 years - and in this film all those promises were betrayed! Helmets? Really!? And the short scene revealing the origins of creatures from ""Alien"" made this Court frankly laugh (and it was a sad laughter...)<br /><br />Some mitigating circumstances are nevertheless recognized:<br /><br />- Michael Fassbender is the real star of this film as he steals the show as David the android.<br />- Noomi Rapace cannot (nobody can!) match Sigourney Weaver, but she still gives a honourable performance. It is highly appreciated by this Court that her character is a believing Christian, even if she seems to be the only one on board (captain Janek may be the second one, but there is not enough hard evidence to prove this). Much will be pardoned to the director for the scene in which she says ""This is the Year of Grace 2093"".<br />- Another mitigating factor is the scene in which the alien ship develops a crush on Charlize Theron and she in return imprints on it...)))<br />- And finally, it must be recognized that the accused is still suffering from PTSD following his association with a film about Fat Robin Hood and Old Maid Marian...<br /><br />Therefore, taking all the evidence in account, this Court decides as follows: 1. The film itself receives two stars. 2. The director is sentenced to a total of no less than 5 and no more than 15 years of bitch slapping by an alien queen of average size and temper, in a facility to be determined at a further hearing. 3. The sentence is suspended until the opening of the sequel of ""Blade Runner"" - it will be however executed in full if this film proves to be another disappointment.<br /><br />This Court is now adjourned and will drown its sorrows by ingesting Black Slime. God bless America!"
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	The movie itself was fantastic, one of the best translations from book to screen yet! I'm really disappointed though at the lack of features on the DVD, as well as the fact that there doesn't seem to be a 2-disc special edition available for those of us (however small a faction that may be lol) who do not have blu-ray players. Hoping they'll release a 2-disc at a later point so I don't have to miss out on the special features completely.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I bought this movie for my friend on his birthday.  We happen to have a projector in our apartment and watching it on there was amazing!  The bigger the screen you have the better the action.  Downey Jr. cannot be beat.  This movie blew everyone away.  Most people thought it would be like every other comic movie, but this one actually has a good plot and good actors.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Up there with Indy 4 and Prince Caspian, Iron Man was one of the top movies I was looking forward to this summer. And thankfully, I was not disappointed. In fact, just about every aspect of the movie impressed me.  As I expected, Robert Downey Jr. captured Tony Stark better than anyone else could have.  The wit, charm, and intensity he brought to the character incorporated everything essential about the billionaire industrialist. He's a playboy, eccentric genius, with a drinking problem. But when Stark discovers that his own company's weapons are being used by terrorists, he decides to live a life of purpose and make some big changes.<br /><br />Donning several versions of Iron Man suits, Tony Stark goes through as much transforming as his inventions. Iron Man is an origin story, but still allows for plenty of depth and character development without letting the story suffer. The supporting cast exceeded expectations: Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and even director Jon Favreau himself plays the small role of Harold Hogan.<br /><br />The special effects and technology also blew me away. From the testing of Stark's armor to the final showdown, viewers will be impressed at the amazing visual effects and plenty of big explosions.  With plenty of humor to lighten up the scenes of intense suspense and action; Iron Man is sure to be entertaining enough for the whole family. And after the credits roll, there's a fun little clip that fellow Marvel comic geeks will enjoy, hinting towards a sequel with some beloved characters.<br /><br />The summer blockbusters have certainly started out with a bang!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Jeff was my inspiration to get started and I'm so happy with my ""otto"" dummy and love to entertain!!!!!!!!!"
B001684L0A	4.0	b	"This movie kept my wife and I captivated for several days as we watched this mini series unfold.Very well done,and very close to how things were back then according to historical documents.We need to be aware of how our great nation was founded,and this is a great venue for learning more or being reminded of how the United States came to be.Just common ordinary people with great vision<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGWQG8"">John Adams (HBO Miniseries)</a>"
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	Food Inc provides and insider's view into the food industry, and how consolidated, industrialized, and de-humanized a lot of food production has become. I'm not sure how biased of a perspective it is, but it definitely does get you thinking.<br /><br />There are arguments by the food multinationals that at current food production levels (bushels/acre) there is not enough arable land to feed the world's population. The key to ensuring food supply is increasing the efficiency (bushels/acre) of the land so that enough food can be produced.<br /><br />However, this makes you question the economic, human, and health costs of the industrialized state of the industry. It also shows how predatory a lot of these corporations can be in some instances. Informative and worth watching.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen. A must have in your collection.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This was an excellent movie. My son and I have spent hours watching it together. It's a great family film. I got it for a great price at amazon. Thanks for the memories.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"This gangster movie shows off Leo DiCaprio's amazing acting ability.  His tortured, but good-hearted character just made you want to root for him throughout.  I don't think ""The Departed"" necessarily deserved the best pic oscar, but Leo should have gotten the best-actor award.  As for Jack Nicholson, can he play any other character?  I'd really like to see him try.  Matt Damon was so unbelieveable.  I can believe Matt as Jason Bourne, but this cardboard character in ""The Departed"" just fell flat.  So IMHO, it was Leo's show all the way."
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	My boyfriend and I loved this movie and we rarely agree on movies! It's the best movie I have seen in a long time. We will watch it over and over again.
B001KEGR8Y	1.0	b	"Jeff Dunham is a racist.  His ""characters"" are mostly based on blatant stereotypes that are immediately offensive to anyone with any sort of empathy towards the feelings of others.  These are not clever jokes based on the differences of diverse cultures.  These are insulting caricatures on the same level as black face or buck toothed ""ching chong ding dong"" characters. I was shocked to discover that something this tasteless existed in the new millennium, let alone that a talentless ""comic"" could hide his inability to tell jokes behind this disgusting display.  Now excuse me while I go try desperately to forget that I saw this."
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	"Pros:<br /><br />1. Shaun T is motivational, and doesn't come across as arrogant as Tony Horton. P90X and P90X2 are much better programs, but I think I'd probably break the screen if I had to listen to Tony for 90 days. I tolerate him only in very limited quantities, maybe once a week or so. ShaunT is OK, although yelling Yo! and talking about himself in third person (Even ShaunT needs a break) is mildly annoying sometimes.<br /><br />2. It does improve cardiovascular fitness.<br /><br />3. I suppose if you have weight to lose, it would contribute to wait loss. Can't tell from personal experience since I am on maintenance diet and do not wish to lose weight.<br /><br />4. Eye candy. There are several guys with nice bodies. Women however in most cases do not have much of a muscle definition and have really puny arms. That should have given me a clue that this one is not really for me.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. Insignificant upper body work. I've added upper body training twice a week and additional yoga once a week, but that is just enough not to experience deterioration, I am not making any more progress with my pullups and advanced pushups (backclap for example, or hands on medicine ball, feet of stability ball pushups).<br /><br />2. Workout is rather imbalanced, can result in too strong quads and consequently tight calfs, hamstrings, and IT band. I am adding additional exercises to correct this, additional stretches and also some foam roller work.<br /><br />3. Risk of injury - so far haven't injured myself, but I've been doing plyometrics moves in other workouts for years. However, a friend who just started injured himself on Day 1, fit test. Knee injury, it will take weeks to recover.<br /><br />4. Stretching is inadequate. Shaun T is obviously not flexible enough, and stretches are too easy and incomplete. I normally add my own stretching.<br /><br />5. If you are already fit starting this, you can't expect big progress, except maybe in exercises you don;t do that often. My first fit test was: switch kicks 123, power jacks 60, power knees 75, power jumps 69, globe jumps 12, suicide jumps 21, push up jacks 36, low plank obliques 76. My second fit test was:  Switch kicks 108, power jacks 53, power knees 91, power jumps 82, globe jumps 11, suicide jumps 23, pushup jacks 40, low plank oblique 86.<br /><br />6. Squats are too shallow. Even in recovery workout, when you are supposed to do ""slow deep squats"" they are not slow and you do not go below the position of thighs parallel to the floor. Insufficient challenge for gluteus muscles. Same applies to those leg lifts and kicks in plank position - I normally do these with added ankle weights, doing it bodyweight doesn't do anything for me. If you want a strength workout for legs and core, Butts&guts from Cathe works great.<br /><br />7. Not enough variety with pushups. Too simple, no advanced pushups.<br /><br />8. Core exercises not challenging enough. If you can do swimmers pushup with 2 medicine balls in P90X2,or pushups on 3-4 medicine balls, anything you encounter in Insanity will simply not be enough. Also I normally do twists with my feet up entire time + 6 to 9 kg resistance (depends how many reps), so bodyweight twists just do nothing for me. Ab Ripper from P90X and P90X2 is much better, and so is STS Abs od Cathe. There should be also something added for low back. Supermens for example.<br /><br />9. Price is just not worth it. Especially considering that there are so many good programs which are free, for example www.lovingfit.com."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	great movie that never looked better!!! this is a must buy for any movie lover, plain and simple for the price its a steal!!!!!
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	great visual good story line wonderful choice of actors kept me interested from beginning to end cant wait for the sequel
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is an outstanding mini-series on the birth of our nation and our founding fathers.I highly recommend this to all parents to make this part of their video library for their children.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	As the title reads it was a Spark of Insanity.  The boys didn't fail with the laughs, (Oh and Jeff was pretty good to) LOL If you are looking for something different in comedy to keep you laughing check on Jeff Dunham and the boys.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This (and the Incredible Hulk) was probably the movie highlights of my year. You got to admit, it took a lot of dedication and perseverance to come up with a movie like this. I have always been a very big fan of Iron Man. He is in fact in the Top Five of my favorite Marvel Superheroes. The CGI is this movie is just plain amazing! And the design of the suit baffles the imagination. I simply enjoyed watching him in action, blasting those repulsor rays and flying in the air at supersonic speeds. Disc #2 of this set will further make you appreciate the effort behind the making of this movie. It is just plain amazing! I highly recommend this to all Marvel fans!
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	If you're into black and white comic strip stuff with gruesomeness and cute techy show-offs, this one's for you.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	An excellent movie.  I would recommend it to all, but it is no film for the faint-hearted.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	The movie was great and the picture quality of the Blu-ray was excellent. When viewing it I thought I was in the theatre.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	After an eye-opening stint as a hostage in Afghanistan, multi-zillionaire weapons manufacturer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) gives up being a merchant of death to don a high-tech suit of his own invention and fight for justice and atonement as Iron Man.  This is a top-notch debut effort from Marvel Studios and hopefully portends more great movies to come.<br /><br />That said, it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first two Spider-Man films.  A superhero really benefits from having a great villain to battle; Spider-Man has the Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus, Batman has the Joker, but Iron Man really never had such an arch-nemesis, even in the comics.  Maybe the Mandarin came closest (and there's a subtle nod to the character in the name of the terrorist organization The Ten Rings), but he's too mystical to be a good fit in a movie like this.  So for a finale we get Stark Industries CEO Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) in an even bigger suit.  By the end of this somewhat underwhelming climax, I was getting flashbacks to Robocop.  Nevertheless, the cast is great, the script is smart, and director Jon Favreau shows a sure hand with this material.  I'm looking forward to the next one.<br /><br />The final line of the film is perfect.
B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	"It should be noted that this movie is designed to be a work of propaganda.  It is not, and was never intended to be, a balanced look at the arguments between evolution and ID.  It is cut from the same cloth as Bill Maher's ""Religulous"".  Both feature a public figure with his mind already made up looking for validation.<br /><br />That said, I'm far from being a Christian or a conservative and I think it's an important film.  Not a great film, but well put together.  Perhaps its greatest flaw is that it did not go far enough to separate Christian propaganda from the notion that some force beyond pure randomness has played a role in the development of life.  The film hints at it, but Stein himself seems attached to attributing ID to a ""god"".  It is not necessarily a god.  It has nothing to do with a religion.<br /><br />In the end, I think the ultimate answer will reveal that it doesn't matter whether there is a god.  I have worked with people who were told they didn't understand science and were kicked out of academia, then went on to create ground breaking innovations that defied basic ""laws"" of science.  I think we need to stop being awed by people who have committed their lives to accumulating letters behind their name through institutional indoctrination and start, perhaps, opening the door.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure that we will someday realize that both evolution and some intelligent force are simultaneously at work, making the notion of survival-of-the-fittest suspect on a fundamental level.  It's pretty obvious to any aware observer capable of that level of sensory.  To close exploration of these life experiences off from inquiry is a disservice to mankind, and that is really the greatest value of Stein's film."
B001KZG99A	1.0	b	"I LOVE THIS MOVIE SAW IT AT THE THEATER WHEN IT CAME OUT.  AS FAR AS THIS BLUE-RAY DVD THAT I PURCHASED FROM YOU, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT A FULL SCREEN DVD.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS MY SETTINGS ON MY FLAT SCREEN BUT I TRIED ""AVATAR"" WHICH I PURCHASED FROM YOU ALSO AND IT WAS FINE.  FULL SCREEN AND BEAUTIFUL.<br /><br />I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL PURCHASE ANYMORE DVD FROM AMAZON.<br /><br />SUE ARENT<br />VERY DISAPPOINTED"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I loved this movie and I would recomend this to any ironman comic fan or just any fan of the actors/actresses in this movie.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Movie is somewhat scary for children in places, but overall great adaptation of the book.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I have been a fan of Harry Potter from the beginning. The imagination it takes to write such fantasy has always amazed me. The movies have stayed true to the books; taking me on an exciting adventure each time. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is the beginning of an end I don't want to see. I DO want to see part two, but am very sad that it will all be over. I would prefer to have Harry become Head Master of Hogwarts and continue to entertain us. I loved the movie as I have loved all of them.
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	Poor.  Would give 1/2 star if available.  Looks exactly like someone took the characters names from the book and made their own story to show on film - and not a well-done story at that.<br />Please go back to the director/producer of the first two movies.  We would pay double or treble the money to have a well-done, accurate, albeit necessarily abbreviated, rendition of a very well-written book.  And would not mind in the least sitting through a 2- or even 4-hour movie - indeed, would relish the experience.<br />This movie is like someone ripping the hood ornament off a Rolls-Royce and putting it on a Mini-Cooper then calling it a Silver Ghost and getting mad when everyone complains about the quality of the ride.  Just Not Done.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	I'm big on darker storylines.  I'm not a die hard fan of the Potter franchise.  I never watched them in the big screen.  I always wait for it on video.  Watching this on Blu Ray is awesome.  I can't wait for the last two movies.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	give me a break - if you want fairy tales where all ends happily ever after then the Harry Potter books are not for you.  Try the childrens section.
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	Sure `Cars' is beautifully animated but it lacks so much to me, especially with all of the hype and praise this film has garnered.  It just didn't make me laugh.  Sure, there are some funny lines littered throughout the film, but as far as consistent humor it was sorely lacking.  The story from the beginning didn't really grab me, but with the right touch it could have eventually.  Larry the Cable Guy was by far the best thing to happen to this cartoon, but even he couldn't make me love it.  I will never be caught saying I wasn't impressed by it's beauty, I mean, I may not like the movie but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't impressed in some ways, but I may also never be caught watching this movie again since aside from the animation there was nothing much to hold my attention.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	There is nothing much more to say, everyone must watch it, and make a decision for themselves on where they stand, but this is the most important issue of our time, food like water... is our lifeline.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Fabulous movie.  Animation was phenomenal.  What a wonderful story.  I used to read the book to my children when they were young.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Very educational and informative. I had a few mouth dropping moments, and was surprised to learn about how the U.S. food industry operates. The sections on e. coli and the meat processing plants solution to combat contamination was especially shocking. Definitely makes me think twice before choosing my food and what I feed to my daughter. Definitely recommend.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I feel this series should be required viewing in all schools.  It would help us remember just how difficult it was to win our freedom, and perhaps we would value it more.  Where are the men like these now, when we need them so desperately?
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	On the up side, the special effects were great.  Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth gave good performances, though Hemsworth was pushed into the background pretty quickly.<br /><br />On the down side, Kristen Stewart got a lot of screen time.  This wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that she can't act her way out of a wet paper bag.  She has no emotion and is totally unconvincing.  Also, the writing was a little iffy.  It wasn't terrible, but it was obvious that the screenplay did not live up to the director's aspirations.<br /><br />My expectations for this film were not that high to begin with, but it still failed to reach them.  If I had it to do over, I'd save my money and wait for this to come to Netflix or Amazon Prime for free.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This has become our 3 1/2 year olds favorite movie. He laughs, plays with his Lightening car as he's watching, talks to the characters during the movie, or joins in with the dialog as the movie is playing. He can watch it over and over and over again. Sometimes all in the same day.<br /><br />Thankfully my husband and I like this one too. It's wonderful to see the characterization of Richard Petty, his wife and Dale Jr. along with other drivers. Not to mention the laughs that pop-up during the credits.<br /><br />And don't miss the special added cartoon at the end. The Ghostlight will make you laugh as well.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I bought this movie for my brother, he had already seen it but wanted his own copy for the holidays. It was shipped out quickly, and was recieved in a nice protective box. This was a good movie and I would recommend it. Even my 2 and 3 year old nieces loved this movie.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Movie: This is Scorsese's Pop-Americana crime thriller and it's unparalleled entertainment. The film has it all: line after line after quotable line. Engrossing twists and turns. Compelling characterizations. And poppy bloody violence.<br /><br />DVD: Great in-depth docs. Pristine video and sound. But the lack of Scorsese Commentary is devastating considering how entertaining the man is when speaking about film and seeing as how he had a ball making this film with the cast included.... well we're just missing out on some interesting stories. A commentary with screenwriter William Monahan would have been a major plus as well.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	Entertaining, but what happened to the special effects? The flying scenes looked like something from a 1950's B-grade SciFi flick. The giant? 1970's video game quality.  This was all about making a film fast for as little money as possible. Most of the SFX were top grade, but they really skimped on the ones that counted.
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	"""Cars"" is director John Lasseter's tribute to American automobile culture. It rolls his love of NASCAR and fondness for the family road trip into a children's morality tale with a little history lesson. The world of ""Cars"" is a populated by driverless autos, so the characters are all machines. A hotshot, rookie racing car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who thinks of nothing but winning the Piston Cup has one week to get to his race in California. But a mishap en route lands McQueen in traffic court in the southwestern town of Radiator Springs. The town judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), wants the arrogant little racer out of town ASAP, but Porsche prosecutor Sally (Bonnie  Hunt) wants McQueen to pave the town's dilapidated main thoroughfare instead, in hopes that it will bring travelers back to the Route 66 town that they abandoned when the interstate was put through. McQueen is loathe to miss his race, but the townsfolk and a hillbilly tow truck named Mater (Dan Whitney) may change his priorities.<br /><br />""Cars"" is an attractive film that smoothly integrates two aspects of car culture -racing and road trips- into a lesson about friendship and respect and a little history of Route 66 towns. But the script is pedestrian. It's hard to believe that someone thought a bunch of bickering over paving a road would be entertaining. You can tune out large sections of this movie without missing anything. ""Cars"" has a lot of technically impressive animation but really only engages visually at the racetrack. It opens with a bang as cars whiz around the track at the Piston Cup and closes in the same vein, with the tiebreaker race, which is much more involving. I can't say if children would enjoy ""Cars"", but, at 1 hour and 54 minutes, it is tedious and way too long. Since ""Finding Nemo"", Pixar has lost its flare for clever dialogue and distinctive animation that adults can enjoy too. To my mind, if a film is too dull for adults, its' not worth a child's time either. Pixar needs better writers.<br /><br />The DVD (Pixar 2006): Bonus features include 2 animated short films, 4 deleted scenes, the movie's epilogue, and a documentary about the inspiration behind the film. ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" (7 min) is a short film in which Mater gets his comeuppance for playing practical jokes. ""One Man Band' (4 1/2 min) is a short film unrelated to ""'Cars"", in which a couple of street musicians duel for the approval of a little girl. ""Epilogue"" (4 min) is the last part of ""Cars"" that played over the credits. In ""Inspiration for Cars"" (16 min), John Lasseter talks about merging the worlds of racing and road trips, the decline of Route 66, and shares part of the Route 66 road trip that the filmmakers took with ""Route 66: The Mother Road"" author Michael Wallis. Subtitles for the film are available in English only."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie is well worth a person's time.  It makes one think about the words you say and the actions or reactions of your life.
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	"I completely enjoyed this film, even though yes - the information is found in many other sources, the assembling of the material was well done.<br /><br />The only problem the film seems to neglect is the simple fact is there is too many people for the amount of food required globally.  If sustainability is the end intention of the film, which I believe is the true message, then all this does is draw a call to action to fix (end) the realities of America's manipulation of abundant cheap food which ultimately will result in the same outcome; world hunger due to too many mouths.<br /><br />It is not politically correct to suggest we limit reproduction but essentially that is what is the only true solution to the issues on a global scale which the film dances around (however elegant it might suggest otherwise)  Let's be honest the population of the world looks like a hockey stick and the only result of such explosions upward are sharp corrections downward; which are witnessed in everything from collapsing ecosystems to stock market bubbles.  All are indicative of correction in some form or another and one thing humans have proven time and time again is our ability to ""not change"" until collapse/catastrophe but thankfully we adapt very well and change afterwards.<br /><br />Some of you may feel change can occur to avoid such limitations, or argue redefining the system can meet all our needs but if viewed as a whole - across multiple issues outstanding and the realities of our continued multiplication that in the end it achieves the same result; we are simply a bad case of fleas until the earth decides to rid herself of us - she will.<br /><br />Perhaps Earth Day should be renamed to People Day, since we are the ones at risk of exterminating ourselves... a simple asteroid can reset the whole process over again, and again, and again.. since we may have reached the limitation of this version."
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	"I was so excited for Snow White & The Huntsman to come out; not because of Stewart and her Twilight involvement, but for the simple fact that the trailer looked amazing.  I should have stuck with the trailer.  The costumes and cinetography are as beautiful as the trailer would have you believe but the acting and script are subpar.  I would watch it again but only with the mute button on and if we can skip Stewart's classic and always there ""oh no.  What should I do?"" face.  Even when she rides to battle and is supposed to be a strong heroine, she has her ""I'm conflicted"" face on.  I think I may hate her as the heroine even more than the script.  By the end of the movie, I was bored and secretly wanted the Snow White to die again just to spice up the movie."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I watched this with two aging race drivers: one a local dirt track champion and the other a former NASCAR Winston Cup driver.  We all loved this movie.  Besides being a high quality animated presentation, my companions pointed out the accuracy and realism regarding the racing episodes and techniques that was evident to them. This movie will be a classic!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Duham is always awesome comedy, we're ready for more.......<br />This DVD is better than the new DVD (Spark of Insanity)
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	"""Snow White"" was originally a European fairy tale made famous as one of the Grimm Brothers 1812 collection. It appeared in a 1916 silent film and a 1933 Betty Boop cartoon before achieving eternal fame in the 1937 Disney animated feature. That film was the first full length animated feature, was #1 at the box office in 1938, won an Honorary Oscar, and earned a spot (#49) on AFIs list of the best films of all time.<br /><br />Since 1937 the story has been reprised on occasion - ""Snow White and the 3 Stooges"" (1961), ""Snow White"" (1987), ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror"" (1997), ""Sydney White"" (2007), and ""Mirror Mirror"" (2012).<br /><br />The most recent version, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is a 2012 fantasy with Charlise Theron as the wicked queen, Kristen Stewart as Snow White, and Chris Hemsworth as the huntsman.<br /><br />South Africa born Charlise Theron is the Oscar winning actress (""Monster"" 2003) who has been in more than two dozen films including ""North Country"" (2005), ""The Italian Job"" (2003), and ""Men of Honor"" (2000). Her role as the wicked queen is one of her worst performances ever.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart is best known from the ""Twilight Saga"" films. The buck toothed tom boy is certainly attractive, but no beauty, and far from the ""fairest in the land."" Indeed Charlise Theron clearly retains the title.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth is best known as ""Thor"" from the film of the same name and the subsequent ""The Avengers"" (2012). He should probably stick with this genre. His performance is uneven, and he certainly doesn't fill the need for a hero in a film like this.<br /><br />The script is all inclusive - they not only manage to keep much of the original story, they add gigantic trolls, gnomes, a tribe of women without men, fairies, a 20 point white antelope, and 8 dwarfs. That's right - 8. Count `em yourself. One dies, so in the end there are only 7.<br /><br />This is such a bad film, and it goes on for hours and hours, the only redeeming quality is some beautiful photography. There are some nice special effects, as when the wicked queen seems to be composed of a group of crows. But they overuse this special effect - trees consist of butterflies, the antelope consists of white birds - so that it gets tiresome after awhile.<br /><br />In the end, the story itself cannot be resolved, but I can't reveal this without spoiling the film for those who choose to see it. But I can't imagine who that would be. It's not suitable for kids, and there's not enough action for adrenaline junkies, nor enough fantasy for the sword and sorcery crowd. Fans of romance will also be disappointed, and people looking for the dark side will probably not find enough darkness here.<br /><br />Bottom line - a poor film that doesn't do justice to the story nor to the excellent 1937 film."
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	First, Scorsese is a genius. He really is. Watch five minutes of Taxi Driver or Raging Bull or Goodfellas and you know it. The Departed is not even close to what he has done before. It's a TV show. Of course, there's Jack Nicholson being JACK. I have to admit that DiCaprio is a great actor, but this isn't really worth the time to watch. It falls short in both narrative and acting.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"It's a funny movie for all ages, the only thing that I see that is not ""Original"" music for the movie. This is a strane thing because all Disney's and Pixar's movies have an original score."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"I worry every year when they announce the new director for the Harry Potter film.  Will they play with the settings? What are they going to cut from the book?  My worrying was unnecessary.  Mr. Yates did an excellent job with Order of the Phoenix!  Plenty was missing from the book, but to be fair, no one wants to sit through a 6 hour movie.<br /><br />Mr. Yates  made Umbridge deliciously  evil.  I regret that the ""Inquisitorial Squad"" didn't get more time in the theatre edition of the film.  Sadly, ""SPEW"" was absent from the film. Also, the Ron and Hermione prefect storyline was completely missing.  Perhaps the deleted scenes will contain some story elements that were noticeably omitted.<br /><br />Great movie overall.  If I were to rank all of the HP movies (based soley on my personal preferences)...<br /><br />#1 - (3)Prisoner of Azkaban<br />#2 - (4)Goblet of Fire/(5)Order of the Phoenix<br />#4 - (1)Sorcerer's Stone<br />#5 - (2)Chamber of Secrets"
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	I really think that without Big Studio guidance, or even the old Hays Office, Hollywood filmmaking has deteriorated badly. I'm all for freedom, but films are collaborative affairs with huge budgets and when the artiste runs the show, we get disaster after disaster. Now the Coen's have jumped the shark.<br /><br />Look, I liked the Josh Brolin character, gritty, poor, but resourceful when he finds the money in the midst of a bad drug deal. But just because you're in old Indian country on the Mexican border, it doesn't mean that there's no human compassion out there. All the existential, it don't matter anymore crap, the cheap killing and philosophizing before execution, all of that has no artistic merit unless someone believes in something. I don't care if it's God or Marx, we can't relate unless it touches our heart.<br /><br />Finally, okay, A Fist Full of Dollars kind of adventure, gritty and the good-guy shoots the bad guys, you won't get that here. The good-guys just retire and mumble something about the good old days when dudes get shot on a porch or something. Awful!
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	THE MOVIE WAS PRETTY GOOD AND A BIT SCARY, THE ACTORS WERE GOOD ESPECIALLY CHARLIZE THERON, MADE SOMETHING FROM THE STORY MAKE MORE SENSE, NOT SURE FROM THE ENDING WHAT ELSE CAN BE TOLD, WOULD DEFINITELY RECCOMMEND IT TO OLDER TEENS AND ADULTS.... SOME SCENES WERE PROVOKATIVE!
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	"My widescreen edition of The Deathly Hallows Part 1 has the deleted scenes available to watch.  I was shocked the first two scenes were cut (Harry with Aunt and Harry's good by to cousin shaking hands).  They totally changed what happened at the beginning, omitting some of the most human reflections in the whole movie.  Can you imagine watching the famous movie ""Gone with the Wind"" today with the final cuts they would make?  Yeah, the story is the movie and the action was only to reflect the times the characters were living through.  I really believe Chris Columbus would have forced the inclusion of the missing scenes if he had been directing."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	An accurate historical view of the revolutionary war period as told through the life of John Adams who was a key figure from the early days of the revolution, through the decades that followed.<br /><br />It offers a great option to view interesting facts about scenes throughout the movie as short pop-up messages.<br /><br />I loved it.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPS8"">Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)</a><br /><br />This is one of the funest movies I have seen. Love how the movie starts and how the movie works. Great effects and sound."
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	I've seen better, I've seen worse.  I skipped all of the Twilight stuff, so this was the first time I'd seen Kristen Stewart act.  Like so many others have said, serious lack of talent there.  Dead eyes, she looked stoned through the entire movie.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was good or great.  The movie had a lot of potential, and it might have been great with a different actress playing Snow White.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Paul Giamatti & a great cast show you what it took to bring about real change in America! The Scenery & reanactment are great. A must to own!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I love action movies with a twist.  With Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg in the same movie directed by Martin Scorsese, how can you go wrong?  Great ending!
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"""The Village"" is a good movie, but people keep expecting it to be a really scary movie with some sort of HUGE twist at the end. It isn't a scary movie (as the advertising seems to indicate), but it is suspenseful. There are some rather tense moments, but I would not call them scary or frightening. Neither does this movie have a big, surprising twist like ""The Sixth Sense"" (actually, that was the only movie of his that had a real big twist, yet people keep expecting it from him).<br /><br />Many of this film's detractors  say ""I saw the 'surprise' coming from a mile away"" or ""the 'twist' was stupid."" I think they are missing the point of the movie and are probably the same people who complained about the aliens in ""Signs."" ""Signs"" is not a movie about aliens. ""Unbreakable"" is not a movie about comic books or men with super-powers. ""The Sixth Sense"" is not just about a little boy who sees dead people. ""The Village"" is not just a movie about a village in rural Pennsylvania in 1892. There's a deeper meaning here, but it seems that most people don't go to the movies to think or ponder, but merely to be entertained. If you're watching this movie for purely superficial reasons, you're going to be disappointed."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Terrific movie/mini series.  HBO did a great job with it.  The acting was great, the characters were well developed and the art design was beautiful.  A+++
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	This was copiously awful movie; one of worst I've ever seen. I highly advise you to give it a miss. For me the worst part was the dreadful, dreadful waste of talented actors who are forced to speak silly, stilted dialogue amongst overpowering scenery. Truly bad!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I highly recommend EVERY see this informative movie and reclaim their power to decide what goes into their bodies.<br /><br />There is a definative domino effect that takes place from the farm to the hospitals when people turn their cheek from the truth. What goes into our crops - goes into our bodies.<br /><br />Everyone pays the price for ignorance. This can be prevented and it starts with every choice we make when we make a purchase at the supermarket which is in a sense our vote.<br /><br />Let this ignite change as it did in the tobacco industry.<br /><br />God Bless<br />Lee<br />[...]
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I was unable to catch Iron Man in the theatre during the summer and so I was waiting for this on Blu-ray quite anxiously. I was pretty confident that it would be good picture and sound as Marvel has yet to make a disappointing Blu release, but I was blown away by Iron Man! This is the definition of a reference disc! Flawless 1080P picture, lossless audio that lets you hear every little nuance of sound from the explosions in Afghanistan, to the ice freezing to the Mark II suit on its first flight. If you want the true theatre-at-home experience, this disc will definitely bring it to you!<br /><br />Downey is a great actor and a great portrayal of the troubled Stark, he comes off as a complete natural throughout the whole film. The supporting roles are all filled by extremely talented cast and that is what sets this movie aside from previous Marvel films like the Spiderman films or HULK, which rely too much on the superhero factor and don't seem to worry too much about the cast.<br /><br />Oh and this definitely is not a movie that should be limited to any specific audience as it is something I would watch with anyone from a little brother to a friend, my mother or grandmother, it is an enjoyable, reasonably realistic film for just about anyone.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I just want to keep going and going.  I have changed my lifesytle because of it.  It really makes you want to succeed.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	I had to run out and buy this. Not only is Kristen Steward awkwardly perfect for the role, buy Charlize Therone as the witch was mesmerizing. And Thor as the huntsman, who could ask for anything more. Beautiful settings and exciting story lines. I recommend watching it and then buying it!
B004JMSIRC	1.0	b	"Its 9-30 and Iron Man is OUT on Blu-Ray! What could go wrong?<br /><br />Oh... DISK 1 FAILS TO LOAD?!?!?! - This is a KNOWN ISSUE...????<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Here is what was said:<br /><br />""<br />by Wayde Robson -- last modified September 25, 2008 18:28<br />Iron Man on Blu-ray - May Have Dodged a Missile<br /><br />In true super-hero style - Iron Man might have narrowly avoided a near disaster. No, it wasn't an explosive missile from his arch-nemesis in the film, Iron Monger played by Jeff Bridges. Instead it was something that could have been devastating for the film's Blu-ray release and possibly delivered a spot of damage to the Blu-ray format overall.<br /><br />It seems retailers carrying Iron Man on Blu-ray, set for release on Sept. 30, are enduring an eleventh hour recall from Paramount. Considering Iron Man was one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer, the splashy special effects film is perfect for Blu-ray's high definition picture quality and Dolby True HD 5.1 lossless audio. It could have been a real set-back for the format itself at this critical juncture as Iron Man could be one of Blu-ray's break-out titles.<br /><br />Due to an apparent authoring problem with the disc Paramount has recalled the Blu-ray version of Iron Man from retailers. Rumor has it the problem was with disc 1 playing back in certain Sony Blu-ray players.<br /><br />The studio received reports of compatibility issues with review copies that had been sent out weeks ago. Distributors have only recently been told to send back all copies of the disc. As a result Paramount has stated that it may have to delay the title's release date to October 7.<br /><br />While a one week delay for the Blu-ray release date may not seem like much, especially after the Godfather Trilogy's release this week - which should keep many BD fans busy, if Paramount decides to go ahead with the DVD release on schedule it will almost certainly hurt Blu-ray sales.<br /><br />But according to some sources, the word from Paramount is that the studio is working around the clock and determined to meet the official release date of Sept. 30. Some have even reported that they've already received a fixed copy of the Iron Man Blu-ray disc so it looks like old ShellHead might have dodged a damaging projectile that wasn't in the script.""<br /><br />Amazon did an Excellent job in sending out a replacement disk - BUT -<br />I now fear that any replacement will also have this Issue...<br />(5 Star Support - Thanks Amazon)<br /><br />USE CAUTION WHEN YOU BUY THIS MOVIE ON BLU-RAY!<br /><br />FYI: I am using a PS3 80GB as my player and online update confirms I have the latest firmware!<br /><br />Buyer-Be-Ware."
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"I absolutely LOVE the alien design.  Love, love, love, love, LOVE.<br /><br />The very end seemed like it was just tacked on to tie in the Alien franchise.  That was annoying.  And it was soooo stupid that they took their helmets off. Like anyone would really do that.  Then again, it's not as if I've been in that situation or any situation resembling it before, so I'm not feeling qualified to have a real opinion.  And it's just a movie.<br /><br />The music is memorable and ""sweeping"" at the right moments.  Made everything seem even more massive!"
B0006989TE	4.0	b	Despite the reviews I've read concerning The Village that endlessly find bad things to say about it, I would strongly disagree because I thought this movie was quite good in that it provided a few tense moments and also unfolded many great surprises as it progressed. Although I will admit to thinking more highly of the director's previous film The Sixth Sense, I thought this movie was well-filmed, had an adequate cast, and was only faulty in that it had a bit of a cliffhanger ending. I would recommend this movie to all who are looking for a good thrill or who enjoy a well-planned series of revelations.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	There are two caveats for filmgoers here: 1) If you have any qualms about extreme violence, do NOT see this film, and 2) If you like at least some degree of resolution, ALSO do not see this film.<br /><br />The ending is so unresolved it feels like the film was purposely cut. Maybe it was; maybe it wasn't. And there are scenes here violent enough to align it with a 1980s style horror movie, no question. BUT--the actors are breathtakingly good. Tommie Lee Jones was born for this role of Sheriff Bell; he walks and talks it like a hand-in-glove kinda thing. PERFECT. Javier Bardem as psychopathic Anton Chigurh is really good. After his first two killings, when you see his face for any length of time, it is supremely unsettling. This guy WILL kill you. And Josh Brolin is remarkable. While his past roles have left this viewer really unimpressed, he's come to a major transition point in this film and turns in an astoundingly good performance. He is absolutely riveting--in fact, has my vote for the best actor in the film (in spite of Jones' and Bardem's brilliant performances).<br /><br />And the supporting cast is great--Woody Harrelson, Stephen Root, Tess Harper, and Barry Corbin are all terrific. In fact, it's the acting that drives this movie home. The extremely intense violence is so horrific it's heartbreaking.<br /><br />Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles on a satchel cache of $2 million in a drug deal gone seriously wrong--dead bodies and pickups lying around in the hot Texas semi-desert sun like really old cast-off clothes. He takes the loot and scrambles away from his home. Meanwhile, Chigurh is looking for the money and slaughters anyone who gets in his way, he doesn't like, loses a coin toss, or has something he needs--using a powerful air gun for killing cattle (which is practical since it can both kill people and kick out a door lock).<br /><br />Sheriff Bell knows Moss and finds out he's missing from Moss' wife, goes after him--and finds slaughter and ruination along the way. One of the memorable scenes in the film is when Bell and a Texas lawman crony of his same age (probably early 60s) sit and commiserate with each other about how things are falling apart.<br /><br />Chigurh has an astoundingly uncommon sense of where people are; it's like he has people finding ESP. He tracks Moss; the tension generated in this one-on-one is fierce and tough, but in fact, the whole film is about tracking. Bell is tracking Moss; Chigurh is tracking Moss; Moss is tracking his future with this $2 million.<br /><br />It's too bad there is so much unresolved at the end. This was obviously intentional, but I think it would have been just a little more satisfying if there had been at least some additional resolution. As it is, we are left hanging with so many loose ends it essentially drives you to read the book--by Cormac McCarthy, one of the greatest regional novelists in the US today (probably the greatest, in fact).<br /><br />Very strongly recommended--just watch out for Chigurh's air gun...
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"- then you might find this story a help. Like many, I am biased to think that a ""Christian"" movie is going to prove a disappointment. After all, the Hollywood stars generally don't risk this type of subject, and the budgets for these films do not run into the 10's and 100's of millions dollars.<br /><br />What is important is the message, not the stars and the budgets. So, with no caution, I recommend that anyone struggling in their marriage, as well as anyone concerned with making sure their marriage is on track, consider this video. It contains solid acting, good camera work and lighting, and a message of faith, which after all is the important part.<br /><br />None of us truly knows what goes on in other households, what struggles come to bear, what the long silences between spouses would tell if they could talk, or what heartache exists between people who pledge to love one another. This movie takes just one scenario and brings it to life. In it we can see how good intentions can be destroyed by reliance upon material desire, failure to openly communicate, and failure to consider the pain of the other spouse.<br /><br />Seeing it may risk one coming to see the value of their spouse and their marriage in a brand new light, and may, in some cases, bring a troubled marriage back to life."

B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	When compared to the books, yes all of the movies stray, but look how long the books are!  What I do, is I think of them as two separate story lines, because, with the exception of the fifth in my opinion, the movies themselves are fantastic.  The effects are good, and when I read the books now, I can't help but imagine these actors saying some of the lines.  The last movie will be the end of an era, because it is hard to argue how astonishing this series is and what it has become.  If you've seen the other movies, there's no reason to stop now!
B008UBYTRG	3.0	b	"I love Jeff Dunham, yet I found his second video to be ok at best.  I giggled a few times, but nothing near like I did with the first one.  His jokes before he brought out his ""dolls"" was better than when he brought them out.  Walter and Peanut was still funny, but the rest should be laid to rest.  The first is still better than this one in my opinion."
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	This was an interesting movie, and the plots were ok, but it wasn't the greatest movie i've ever seen.  I thought the plots got kind of repetitive and monotonous after the first couple of stories.  Not to mention it was really depressing.  So, overall, nice try, but I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone who isn't a die-hard Tarantino fan.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	I loved the books.  I was stunned at how the HBO show is so sexually graphic.  I went back and checked the books and there is some sex but that isn't the focus of the story.  There is so much more sex in the show.  It is unnecessary for the story.  I wish the story line was followed more closely.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	True Blood by far is one of the few vampire-esque miniseries I've been able to get into and stay into throughout its 4 seasons. The vampire lore is not quite as tested in True Blood as it is in other mediums that showcase vampirism and that is what adds to the allure of the series. The cast could not have been more perfectly assembled, in my opinion, as each character builds even in the first season and continues to progress throughout the series. The chemistry between Paquin and Moyer is mesmerizing and keeps the series hopelessly addictive for those of us with a romantic side. The first season by far is my favorite due to the suspense and sub-plots that run their course throughout the course of the series. This is a must have for any vampire lore lover and those seeking something a edgier than the Twilight Series or Vampire Diaries.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This movie is so funny my sides are still hurting. Jeff Dunham is by far the best in the business.Well worth the money! I can't wait until he comes out with another one!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Someone leant this film to me and I have to say, I thought it was superb. When your marriage has reached rock bottom and you cant see where you should be going, when the trees are so thick, you cant move in any direction, then this gives inspiration and hope. I am a Christian and have unbelieving family within the UK, of whom I will be sending a copy to. Christian or non Christian, you should love this film, as its made to show that theres hope even in the mid winter of marriage. Dont despair, have faith and learn from this well made and moving film. I highly recommend it to you!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I had seen Jeff and Walter before, and have never been disappointed with them.  I saw this on Comedy Central, my wife saw the DVD at some rental place, and we bought it for a Christmas present for the whole family.  We STILL laugh out loud after seeing this umpteen number of times.  Our whole family has stolen tag lines from every person in the show.  From Walter to Sweet Daddy, Bubba J., Peanut, and Jose Jalapeno, the entire experience is one laugh after another.  Jeff Dunham is a master ventriliquist!  He really can bring these characters to life.  You will almost swear you can see the expressions change on their faces.  The bleeped version is just as funny as the unedited version!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Beautiful movie with a great message!  Love Kendrick brothers movies but this one is really special... Make you fall in love again as a couple! Give you tips for a healthy and godly marriage and relationship.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"*Warning: Spoilers Ahead*<br />I really wanted to give Snow White and the Huntsman 5 stars. There were a few things that kept me from it. There were a couple different scenes that I felt were unfinished, as if more should have been added to them, or that there were missing scenes altogether. The effects are spectacular, truly mesmerizing at times. The costumes were immaculate and I could tell they were very well thought out. The battle scenes lacked... well, a lot. Most of them seemed to be too brief, and a few appeared to lack common sense.<br />I had hoped that Kristen Stewart (Snow White) would have done a better job of playing her part. ""Skin white as snow, lips red as roses, hair black as a raven's wing..."" While very pretty, and having no problem looking the part of Snow, Stewart seems lazy or overconfident in her role. Her performance gets a 3 star from me.<br />The movie brings to life the classic fairy tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but in a dark, twisted way, I might add. After the death of Snow White's (Kristen Stewart) mother, her father discovers a slave woman, dirty and locked in chains, in a carriage. With beauty beyond measure, Ravenna (Charlize Theron) - who gets 5 stars from me - takes his breath away, steals his heart, and within a day agrees to be his Queen. On their wedding night, Ravenna declares that her heart has been broken by a King before, and no other will ever get the chance to do it again. She stabs him to his death.<br />Now, the Queen for 10 years, Ravenna has everything, including a magic mirror that could possibly answer any question she could think to ask it. But her one nervous question, asked often, is this, ""Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is fairest of them all?"" For she would destroy any and all maidens who's beauty surpasses her own. To keep her flawless, un-aging body, she has to suck the youth and innocence from young girls like I would imagine a succubus or demon would.<br />One day the mirror tells Ravenna that Snow White's beauty will soon pass her own. But if Ravenna can kill her, she will have her beauty and immortality forevermore. So she sends her devoted brother to the towers where Snow White had been imprisoned since her father's death, leaving everyone in the kingdom to think that she was also dead.<br />Cleverly, Snow White escapes and runs into the Dark Forest. The dangers that await her there are extreme, but not worth going back to face her evil step-mother that will surely rip out her heart to gain immortality and beauty forever.<br />Ravenna offers to bring back to life the dead wife of the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) - who also gets 5 stars from me - if he can bring Snow back to her. He reluctantly agrees, but after finding Snow he listens to her pleas that the Queen is lying, and she will give him no such reward.<br />The Huntsman fights to save her from the Queen's brother and the dangers of the forest. And just when you think they will be safe, something threatens their lives again. They meet up with 8 dwarfs who try to help her, too. But the Queen seems to always be one step ahead. Ravenna uses a spell to transform herself to look like a close childhood friend of Snow's. The Queen in disguise offers her a bright red, poisonous apple, and after only one bite, it sends Snow to her death.<br />All her friends grieve the loss of Snow White. Her childhood friend, William (Sam Claflin) kisses her goodbye, then leaves her alone in the room with the Huntsman. The Huntsman then begins to confess his undying love to Snow and admits to having two loves in his life and failing them both. He kisses her goodbye and leaves the room she is in.<br />Snow opens her eyes, walks out to the crowd and plots to take back over the kingdom and kill the Queen.<br />The Queen finally falls to her own death by the hand of Snow White, but only after the death of quite a few people along the way. The kingdom and the land are restored to harmony, and the evil is lifted from the land.<br />All in all I thought this movie was great, but there was definitely room for improvement, hence the 4 stars. I will buy it the day it comes out on Blu-Ray, and probably watch it numerous times. One last thing, I took my 6 year old daughter to see it. The violence of the battle scenes was a little too much for her. But I highly recommended it for ages 10 and up!<br /><br />Review written by K.S.

B0006989TE	3.0	b	"What I was expecting from ""The Village"" was a supernatural thriller about some mysterious creatures in the woods. What I got was an allegory on morality, power, and fear. Which begs the question: would I have enjoyed the film more if I had gone in with the right expectations? Honestly, I don't think so.<br /><br />This is because my expectations were based on something more important, more fundamental than the particular genre of the picture. I was looking for a story to be drawn into and characters to be emotionally invested in. I wanted to be moved and enthralled and entertained. And unfortunately, Shyamalan's latest is a huge disappointment in this respect.<br /><br />First let me say, I have no problems with the twist at the end. Although I was underwhelmed, the revelation only alters the context (thematic implications), not the text itself (story). The strengths of Shyamalan's previous mainstream movies have always been the characters and the relationships between them. At the very core of ""The Village"" is the budding love between Ivy Walker (Howard) and Lucius Hunt (Phoenix). This relationship is the heart of this film and is crucial to the life of the story. The issue is not that Shyamalan is unable to pull off the romance (their union is a bit heavy-handed and abrupt, but Howard and Phoenix manage to smooth out the kinks with their charm). Rather, the problem is that it is never fully realized. Shyamalan doesn't allow enough screen time for the most important element of the narrative to grow and take hold. This is most evident in the final moments of the film when the last line of dialogue is uttered. The credits roll and there is no catharsis, no exultation, no sense of fulfillment or completion.<br /><br />I think the source of the problem lies in the conflicting intentions of the filmmaker. What I see in ""The Village"" is two separate films: a love story about sacrifice and courage, and a philosophical meditation on fear and control. Instead of featuring one on the surface and burying the other underneath, Shyamalan attempts a balancing act of narrative and social commentary that, although interesting on their own, fail to mesh together into a cohesive whole. The more I think about it, the more I'm inclined to believe that Shyamalan cared more for his message than his characters. Was the love story simply a tool to hook us in emotionally and to add power to the ideas he's putting forth? Sure seems like it. I suppose, intellectually, it is appropriate for a film about secrets to be presented in a deceptive manner. But emotionally, it makes for a hollow moviegoing experience.<br /><br />Despite its weaknesses, ""The Village"" is not a complete loss. The love between Ivy and Lucius is deeply moving in its simplicity and purity. And with a crew as skilled as the cast, it is no surprise that the technical aspects of the film are beyond reproach. Although not quite as memorable as some of Shyamalan's other pictures, the presentation of ""The Village"" possesses an alluring beauty in Roger Deakin's cinematography and James Newton Howard's music.<br /><br />The best example of this is the scene where Ivy stands by an open door and waits for Lucius in the midst of danger. It is a captivating moment, full of power and grace in its lyrical images and engaging violin melody. Like all great cinema, the sequence is noteworthy not only for what you can see on the surface (a story element that vividly crystallizes Ivy's and Lucius' love) but also for what you can sense underneath (a subtle reflection on blindness, fear, love, vulnerability and courage).<br /><br />Of all of M. Night Shyamalan's mainstream films, ""The Village"" is my least favorite. As a social commentary, it is thought-provoking but clumsy. As a romance, it starts off well but never comes to fruition. And as a suspense thriller, it simply fails to thrill or entertain."
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	This DVD rounds out my collection of the series. It was somewhat dark compaired to some earlier movies but enjoyable, nevertheless
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I just flat out love this movie. I'm a middle-aged mom who isn't the biggest action fan in the world, but this movie bowled me over. My young sons weren't sure they wanted to see it at the theater (my younger boy spooks easily and thought Iron Man looked scary on the commercials), so I ended up watching it on a plane last summer. As soon as I saw it, I knew I'd buy the dvd. My husband and both boys love it now, and I think it's my favorite action movie, and certainly my favorite superhero movie (because I don't like any other superhero movies). The film moves along at a breakneck speed, almost as quickly as Robert Downey Jr. talks. This is a fast, clever movie that is by turns seriously moving and laugh-out-loud hilarious. The casting is sublime. Any other actor would have given the movie a completely different tone. I totally bought Downey as the smart-alec (I'm using the nice word) savant with a weakness for women and cars but a sincere desire to do the right thing. I just love this movie! Can you tell?
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	it is super hard. but it is worth every penny (if you have the heart). after each work out my mucles feal like jello or there on fire and its awesome. and the results come quick. but you do have to work for them... just dont stop.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	I am very satisfied both by the product that I got & also the speed of delivering this.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I love Harry Potter and can not wait for part 2 to come out. The quality of the disc was great. I recieved it early.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	When I first saw a True Blood poster, I thought that this series was terrible thing to the HBO Specials, this is beacuse I'm tired of seeing vampires everywere, affortunately one day with nothing to do I turned my TV, and I saw one episode of this faboulous series, and since then I love true blood. To be honest, I actually didn't read the books, but if they are as good as the series they rock!!!!!.<br /><br />The image quality of the Blu-Ray is awsome, even on the extras that are very ingenous, and the sound is really really nice, actually I love this, and since is my first series on Blu-ray I thought that i see her with love.<br /><br />By the way sorry for my english, and buy True Blood!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I have seen him in person several times but it has been a while.  I was excited to see a DVD of his act and wasn't disappointed. It is very, very funny.  Not for young kids because of ""R"" rated language."
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	Ok so the movie itself was good and everyone in this movie was good except for Kristan Stewart for some reason I don't know if its just me but she only has one facial expression and its the one that looks like she's always in excruciating pain she is a horrible actress and anyone who hires here is stupid she only has one facial expression really come on!!!!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This was a wham bam thank you mam action film, you knew  with Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Dusk Till Dawn, El Mariachi)  it was going to be pretty good and it was and then some!!!<br /><br />Using the latest in cgi technology and mixiing with black  and white noir layering to emulate that of a classy crime  film, Sin City operates on all cylinders like a fine oiled  machine.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good on all from Mickey Rourke,to Jessica  Alba to Clive Olin.<br /><br />I never even read any of Frank Miller's book but the beauty  of the movie is that you dont have to, though it would help.  I was never really lost with the story and I was able  to connect with all the characters. Overall a great movie!!!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	These have to be two of the funniest DVD we have seen in a long time. The charaters are wonderfully full of imagination and personality. My husband and I laugh everytime we watch them. My children are of adult age and we have been able to enjoy them together. I would not recomend them for children but the Insanity DVD does have the censored version which I have not watched. Enjoy ad I do hope that Jeff keeps creating this wonderful entertainment for many years! I am truly a fan.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	insanity is such an awesome work out once you get commited and stick to your diet you will definetely see results. It is definetely painful but you will be sure that when you feel this you are getting a great work out and you will be in the best shape ever !!! I am one satisfied customer.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This is my favorite HP film to date, with Azkaban being my second.  Of course it is not the book.  No movie can be, especially with these detailed and lengthy HP books.  However, I loved the camera cinematography when Harry & Dudley are running in the rain, and you feel as you are running along with them.  I love the bonding moments with Harry & Sirius just before Harry boards the train to Hogwarts, and in front of the Black family tree.  Or, when he tells Ron & Hermoine about his kiss with Cho; or when he talks with Luna in the forest.  They are tender moments, and there are many like them in the film.  I loved that the sound is cut while we witness Harry's reaction to Sirius's fate at the Ministry.  The scene with Dumbledore & Voldemort is extremely powerful, showing how extraordinary these two wizards are, and you feel the magnitude of the spells in their duel.  The bad part of the film is that Grawp looks fake or superimposed in the scene.  I find the directing an enormous improvement over Goblet (bad Dumbledore!).  And I find the young actors, especially Dan Radcliff, improving their acting skills.  The other adult actors are fabulous to watch.  Separate this from the books, and take it as 2 hours of enjoyable storytelling.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"There is lots of talk saying that though Scorsese won his first Oscar for this film, it is the wrong film to be rewarded for. To be perfectly  blunt... it isn't his fault that the academy passed up on all his other masterpieces before allegedly setteling on this one. To go a bit further, I don't think this film is a masterpiece per se', but it is pretty damn near perfection.<br /><br />The irony of it all is that this film is ctually a remake of an oriental thriller called ""Infernal Affairs"" (I believe... haven't seen it and nor do I care to)<br /><br />Still, this is a thriller that is expertly crafted and intricately unraveled. The story begins with a boy recieving groceries from a powerful mob boss (played with typical flair by Jack Nicholson) who then grows up and enters the police force. The young man is Matt Damon and he is working secretly for that very mob boss while posing as a cop. Enter Billy Costigan (Dicaprio) as another cadet who is not exactly cop material but has something more useful that flags him for undercover duties. He ultimately gets tagged with the job of bringing the mob boss down. Unfortunatley, it quickly becomes clear to both men that there are other players in the mix and other road blocks to them both achieving what they desire. Ironically, both men share a love interest (the stunning Vera Farmiga) yet they never find  out about each other although it is alluded to near films end.<br /><br />The thriller moves at a modest pace, slow and clunky at times... but it all adds up to more meaningful story and fateful climax. I was told that there were many twists and turns but I didn't really notice any... save for one. Yet, the intensity of the plot and the unpredictability of the mortality of certain characters kept my attention glued to the screen. When this film needed to, it upped the ante and delivered on the thrills. All the actors did wonderful jobs and any of them could have been nominated for the supporting actor role. Whaldberg was quite good so it was nice that he got the nod.<br /><br />So, it may not be a masterpiece but it certainly delivered... and apparently it was intriguing enough to earn the director the gold he deserved for all his previous efforts."
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	superb acting and beautiful direction are the corner stones of the film, but the plot puts Prometheus on a pretty high level of sophistication. It asks some really complicated questions about human nature and our quest for answers and purpose, our fear of death, our lust for the unknown, and the dangers of these very human matters. It doesn't answer these questions, which is the whole point. These are questions that can't be answered, only considered, and they subtly imply this theme through situations in the movie.<br /><br />all in all a wonderful triumph for Mr. Scott hope to see many more in the future<br /><br />loved it
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	There are no problems with the DVD (it rocks).<br /><br />I just had to wait a fair while to get it.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I have to say this was/is one of the BEST films I have seen in a very long time! Javier Bardem.. WOW.. what a performance! He will now be forever ranked with the likes of Anthony Hopkins / Hannibal Lecter!!<br />I can't wait to watch this on DVD to catch the hidden gems that I missed in the theater.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Classic movie, on Christmas Eve, a doubting boy boards a magical train that's headed to the North Pole and Santa Claus's home. Great.
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	I am a big older Harry Potter fan.  I am very disappointed in WB.  I love Ultima 1 and 2 because they were extended editions, but now we have another Star War and Lord of the Ring were you have to go through a director cut ... etc. before you get the extended version some years down the line.
B00447G29S	3.0	b	"""The Polar Express"" is the story of an unnamed boy who does not believe in Santa anymore.  On Christmas Eve night, while lying in bed, hears a train outside his window.  When goes outside to see what it is, he finds the Polar Express, which is on its way to the North Pole.  So begins his adventure.  Along the way, he will meet other children, a mysterious hobo, and have some amazing adventures, before arriving at the North Pole in time to see Santa off on the busiest night of his year.<br /><br />""The Polar Express"" is both impressive and disappointing at the same time.  The characters are animated using motion capture performance, mostly done by Tom Hanks.  The characters look somewhat real, but are just enough off to look creepy at times (specifically the little girl, the elves, and the waiters).  The movements seem a little odd at times, and that is difficult to explain because they are based on real movements.  Perhaps it is just the animation.  The overall animation is impressive though.  The Polar Express and North Pole are fully realized in all their glorious detail.<br /><br />The songs are unmemorable, but the performances by Tom Hanks are good.  He gives life to numerous characters, some of them children, in such a way that you believe that they seem real and true to their age.  The story has been modified from the book in order to accomidate a longer running time, and it works to some extent.  The movie moves swiftly for the most part.<br /><br />In the end, ""The Polar Express"" will probably become a childrens' holiday classic.  I would not call it the best Christmas movie ever, but more likely than not, children will find enjoyment in the story of a child who learns to believe again."
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"The fifth Harry Potter film sets the stage for war.  Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is on the loose, although certain parties in the Ministry of Magic would have the public believe otherwise by publicly accusing Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) of lying about his return.  When the detestable Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) takes over Hogwarts, stripping the curriculum of practical spells, and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seems to turn his back on Harry, the angry young man takes it on himself to train his friends for the coming conflict.<br /><br />Radcliffe turns in his best performance to date in the least of the Potter films.  I haven't read the book yet, but perhaps it was a mistake to make the longest book to this point into the shortest film.  The screenplay often seems to race from development to development and the huge cast has become positively unwieldy, with many incredible actors reduced to brief, unsatisfying walk-ons.  However, it was still very entertaining and its awkward nature is perhaps inevitable; like ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" the whole film essentially serves as a prelude to much bigger events to come.  The earlier films were far more successful at maintaining their own independent identities.  At any rate, it makes me eager to see what comes next."
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	I've always been an Indiana Jones fan and always will be so of course I'm a little bias with this movie but I don't think by much.  The one thing people have to remember is eighteen years have gone by so Indy can't still be fighting the nazis any more so we come up with the Soviets during the cold war era.  I also think the movies story quest about the crystal skulls was also pretty good and I think it depends on the person points of view whether or not the crystal skulls were truly alien in origin.  I don't want to give away to much so you'll just have to see the movie and see what I'm talking about.  The one downside I think was the actor who played Indy's son I'm not saying he was a bad actor but he just seemed a little lame to be Indy's son not to be cruel.  It's to bad we cant go back in time a little because if you've seen the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles I think the actor Sean Patrick Flannery would have been great to play Indy's son in the movie.  I do also like that they brought back the original actress who played Marion in the first Indy movie that brought a little nostalgia back for me. The blu-ray dvd does do the job the video is superb and the audio is incredible a great job done for the blu-ray dvd.  So if you're like me and have the Indiana Jones movies as well as the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles set finish your collection and get this final incredible movie for yourself right away...
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Whether we like to admit it or not, watching most of the hollywood movies these days affects us in negative ways. Just like with a computer, garbage in garbage out... We watch the trash that they put out - mostly because there is not much worth a darn coming out of that more evil than not place.<br /><br />This movie - FIREPROOF - has wonderful characters, an excellent story and most of all a positive message. If they'd had some directors/producers with more talent, it could have been a great movie, I felt the actors (especially Mr. Cameron) were very good.<br /><br />I hope they make more movies with good messages, little by little we can make a difference in what they put out!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"Food, Inc. is necessary viewing for every health conscious individual on the planet.  They show what's happening within our food production industry.  They expose the things the mass producers don't want you to know about because you might stop eating their products.  As you watch the movie, you won't want to believe this really happens in our country, but the evidence is right in front of your eyes.<br /><br />It was only a short time ago when I believed our government agencies had our best interest at heart.  Maybe I was naive, but I certainly wasn't alone.  This video will show you what & who can be bought when you have big bucks to throw around.  It will also reveal how we've been sold a load of ""you know what"" in nice pretty packaging, but the manufacturers don't want you to know what you're really eating.<br /><br />You know what's really scary?  If the food industry continues along the path of the mass producers, we'll be eating only what they say we can eat regardless of its nutritional value.  If you want to have healthy options, you need to see this video and get the facts."
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	"Fantasy films have always held an interest for me. This rendition of the ""Snow White"" story was really wonderful. The computer generated imagery enhanced the story and the performances by the actors were convincing. A worthwhile addition to my DVD collection and warrants a replay time and time again. I would certainly recommend this film for the imaginative more than a fairy tale viewer. Good fun."
B0006989TE	5.0	b	This movie is definitely worth a watch. Although it starts slow and does not really add anything to the viewer's knowledge till it's half over, it makes up for it all in the end. The twist is not thin by any definition of the word... only the few who do not understand the end are the ones to call it thin. But in that case the million dollar question arises: how could anybody be so dumb? The end is absolutely clear... unless you have an underdeveloped brain.<br />The latter half of the movie is very gripping and pays off well for the patience which the audience shows in the first half.<br />The most remarkable feature of Shyamalan's movies is, that unlike other horror movies, they are not stuffed with scary scenes. Instead, he invites the audience to think about the mystery... about what the theme is. Also, the hidden message in the movie makes an extremely strong impact.<br />So if conventional gimmicks rather than involving intelligent direction attract you to a movie, this one is not for you.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This is a great telling of the 5th book, the correct scenes were deleted and the movie really makes an impact on any Harry Potter fan.<br />Can't wait for the next one.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I saw this show live in Pittsburgh, PA and couldn't wait for the DVD to come out...it's better & longer than the live show! The Make-a-Puppet bonus feature is really cool. I enjoy this show more each time I watch it.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	I decided after reading reviews and doing tons of research on workout videos to select this workout. I am a 24-year-old female, with about 15 pounds I can afford to lose. I had previously tried out Shaun T's Hip-Hop Abs, but didn't find it a challenge. I saw this and thought I'd give it a try, even though many females haven't reviewed it.<br /><br />First of all, here are a few things you should know before you buy this workout:<br /><br />1. It is not a workout to do on carpet. I had to purchase a wrestling mat in order to get all the workouts done properly.<br />2. For women: this is a great workout! I have a ton of fun learning the football drills. I do about 1/2 the pushups though because I am not about having a super-toned upper body. Just not my thing (however I do have great arms now, they have thinned out nicely).<br />3. This workout is not for people who have bad arms(wrists) OR knees. I've injured both during this workout, even though I was working out almost every day prior to this. INSANITY definitely requires a body that is robust and ready for a little post-workout pain.<br />4. Athletic training sneakers are a MUST. Cross-trainers and running shoes didn't provide my feet with the amount of support I needed. I had to go to the Nike outlet and get something that supported the ENTIRE base of my foot.<br />5. The diet plan isn't hard! It's a great bonus to have cheap, easy, and fast meals included.<br />6. I know the really popular review states something about approx. 30 minutes per workout. It's more like 40-45, including a warm-up, and stretching before&after.<br />7. If you don't have the time to do this 6 days a week, I wouldn't bother. It's definitely something that requires dedication and a passion to be fit and healthy.<br /><br />I'm halfway through the program--- getting ready for month 2/my recovery week. I am 5 lbs lighter, and my body is just getting more and more toned and gorgeous. I love the feeling of being able to throw on a bikini. Ladies, you might be scared to do this because it definitely looks like a guys' workout--- it's not! I am a girly girl and I love this! I feel so incredible and ready to skimp around a beach. It's worth every penny.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I was mesmerized by what i know was a factual account of the founding of this country with John Adams as a main instrument in forming the birth and growth of this country,although he and all the founding fathers have turned in their grave many times as this country is not being run nor has it in many years as John Adams and the other founding fathers intended it to be run...They founded this country by the people,for the people and with the people's welfare first not they're own agenda as many Presidents since have....This program was educational as it was interesting and i could not wait until the next part was shown....This rates 5 stars twice over....
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	No Country for Old Men has an amazing script, a fresh story line and wonderful actors. Its not often lately that we get any kind of entertainment that doesn't walk in that safe-zone of known, successful plot devices. This one kind of forges new ground, but most importantly, it doesn't lose any momentum over cliche. The ending is something you'll either have to come to grips with, or not... but the performances, the camera work, and the story are something you won't expect.<br /><br />The atmosphere is good, and the movie is thankfully void of a musical score, allowing the action in the movie to take on an eerie, realistic tone, without sound cues to coddle the viewers and prepare them for what happens next.<br /><br />Superb movie; I'm glad I bought it.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Most Christian movies can be a bit hokey even though I like them and appreciate the good message.  This one was actually not hokey.  It was painful to see the emptiness of a marriage having been neglected. It was portrayed in a realistic light. Yet this movie is about hope and forgiveness and about responsibility. This movie does not sugar coat and say all you need is Jesus and everything is fine. No. This movie says that we must work at love and act loving even when we don't feel like.If we can not get stuck in our own sense of entitlement and feelings, then even a marriage that seems lost can not only be saved, but blossom. This is a really good movie. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"I have to say that I've seen this movie twice, and it was time well spent.  As Pixar always does, the animation was outstanding, and the story was top notch.  The kids can see all of the cool race cars, while the adults can appreciate the story about individuals who care about each other.<br /><br />This movie has definitely been one of the better movies of the summer.  We need more movies to remind us that life is too short to not stop and smell the roses.  We need to appreciate those around us and what they bring to our lives.  Towards the end of the movie, when Lightning McQueen stops right before the finish line and goes to push ""The King"" over the finish line, the viewer can see McQueen's transformation from a selfish race car to one who realizes that he needs others on his team in order to succeed.<br /><br />I wish that there were more movies out there with such a positive message and lots of humor.  It is ironic that a movie about cars can remind me of why we need other people in our lives.<br /><br />Pixar does it again.  Cars hits a homerun, scores a touchdown, and wins first prize in the race.  We all need to remember to stop and smell the roses.  Seeing Cars reminded me of that very fact."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	You will not be disappointed with this purchase, and it will be money well spent. Plus you can share it with your family and friends as an added bonus.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I wasnt a big fan of the first harry potter movies as they were a bit childish and tacky. This movie adds more of a dark element to the movie which adds good suspense and kept me engaged... I would recommend watching it, but only if you've seen the other ones... otherwise watch them all first!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Excellent film with a message of selfless love that anyone should appreciate.  My fiancee and I enjoyed it and both took away some valuable ideas for how to make a marriage last!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"I wish I had gotten HBO when this series started! This series is as colorful as a palette of oils. The characters are so different from one another that you can imagine yourself living in that little town. They are genuine and complex. And to mix it all up, are the murders that begin to happen all around Sookie Stackhouse, a waitress who seems to stay in the middle of it all. Sookie is never the same after a ""coming out of the closet"" Vampire named Bill walks through the door. And then the steamy sex happening all over town doesn't hurt either. I wish I lived there, those people know how to have a little fun! I totally recommend if you have or have not read the series. For those of us who have read the books the show offers us new subplots, for those who haven't read the books...well you're missing out on something only a novel can give you (using your imagination). This series is loaded with language, nudity and violence (so not for the youngin's) so you may not want to watch it with your dad!"
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"Having seen all of the previous Harry Potter movies, I ordered this one to watch before going to see ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, Part 2. My family found it to be very exciting and entertaining and definitely a prelude to the last installment."
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	This is a great movie!!! I'm very pleased with Robert Downy Jr., his performance was the best!!! Can't want for a second one, the chemistry between Robert and Gwyneth was awesome!!! And I love Terrence Howard!!
B00447G29S	1.0	b	ordered this item on December 22nd.  Never received it, so I canceled the order.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Excellent product!  I highly recommend it.  Just be careful with the jumping and your heart rate.  Other than this, I recommend because it works!  You will get in great shape, so long as you stay with it and push through it.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"I was astonished at how stupid, ridiculous and boring this film was, and how the producers and script writers, when not rehashing the elements from the original Alien, were busily stealing plot elements and ideas from other authors and film  makers. In the beginning of the film, we are shown an alien who for some reason dies. But there is no explanation as to what is going on or why--like it was tacked on as an afterthought. Flash forward, from the present, to 70 years into the future--a future that seems no different than present day. Seventy years from now explorers using the standard  tools of the 19th century, find a cave and within the cave we see 6 stars above a lion--and this is an amazing discovery 70 years from now and it means that prehistoric men understood astronomy! Astonishing, right?  In a book edited by Sir Roger Penrose <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982955200"">Consciousness and the Universe: Quantum Physics, Evolution, Brain & Mind</a> there is a chapter on ""Paleolithic Cosmology"" which reproduced cave paintings from Lascaux, the ""Hall of the Bulls"" and detailed how above the back of one of these charging bulls, appears a grouping of 6 stars, which the author believed represented the ""Pleiades"" which is associated with the constellation of Taurus. Yes, somehow this was lifted and found its way into Promethsus, and it becomes  the reason why a space ship is sent to the Pleiades--but without any explanation. Hey, they are pointing at stars, lets send a space ship and meet our creators--the engineers. What? This is not just a leap of logic, it makes no sense. The plot of the book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JE2FKU"">Life and Death on the Red Planet The Pyramids of Mars: Genetics in the Garden of Eden. The Adventures of the First Mars Colony</a>(which was published by the same publisher), centers on the exploration of a hollow diamond shaped mountain on Mars which reveals, thanks to holograms created by the aliens, the secrets of advanced alien race which genetically engineered and created modern humans. Then some of this alien DNA is activated, and some of the human on Mars start becoming just like the original aliens. Surprise! We get the same plot in Prometheus, except in Prometheus it doesn't make any sense. OK--so the major aspects of Prometheus were just lifted from books and authors published by Cosmology Science publishers, and then these jokers who made Prometheus tried to pass this material off as original ideas about our origins. Then  there is the scene where the two scientists are lost inside the hollow mountain/space ship, and this reptilian creature rises up, stares at them, they remark on how cute it is, then it unfolds a fan like ornament/appendage around its neck and attacks--and this is taken right out of the film Jurassic Park. The list of thievery goes on and on in this film in search of a plot.<br /><br />Then there is the really bad, often, really stupid acting. No plot, bad acting--its like a B-movie but with a 200 million dollar budget and almost no special effects worth mentioning. The movie is so stupid, the actors act like such idiots, the plot is so ridiculous... How could Ridley Scott produce such crap?<br /><br />There is nothing original  or ""science fiction"" about this boring ridiculous movie which really didn't make any sense--which is probably because the film-makers were so busy stealing from other people, they didn't have time to develop a plot or come up with anything original. When they make part 2 of this film, one can only wonder who they are going to steal from next.<br /><br />Final verdict. Boring, inane, stupid, a mishmash of other people's idea and work, coupled with some really bad acting and no plot."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is the funiest comedian ever. It is amazing how he can generate their voices and then switch right back to his. It is all too easy to forget that he is the one speaking for the puppets. Our family watches these videos over and over and over and they never get old. This is a definite must see!!!
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	No Country for Old Men is one of those movies you just can't wait to see if it lives up to all the hype.  Well, the first half of the film had me glued to the screen.  I only wish the second half could have been anything close.<br /><br />C'mon folks, the movie had intrigue, really cool characters, interesting dialogue...everything going for it.  And then poof, it's all gone.  What happened?  Why would any writer or director let this happen?<br /><br />Watch the first half of this movie, stop the DVD, and then make-up your own ending.<br /><br />My three stars is only for the first half.  The second half gets a -3 stars.<br /><br />See ya next review.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	-  The Iron Man bust is small at about 1:6 scale, but has a solid weight and attention to detail that even non-collectors will notice.  The $50 gift card is good through 2009, and more then covers the extra cost for the set.  Those inclined to want the mini bust will likely find many more of their geek interest covered by the dozens of items  available on Sideshow Collectibles gift card approved list.<br />  -  The movie case is the full standard multi-disc retail package, so I won't comment on it beyond mentioning two points.  One; it will likely be the Canadian (French/English) cover design with the same disc content as in the US.  Two; it's worth buying the slightly more expensive Blu-ray version if you have an HDTV home theater.<br />  -  IF this sounds like a silly waste of an extra $20-$30, then pass... it's not for you.  However, those who like this kind of set won't be disappointed.  This isn't some cheap bit of molded plastic, it's a genuine collectible.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	The Coen brothers take a wide step away from the quirkiness of Fargo with this intense adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel. Javier Bardem plays Chiqurh, a brutal killer tracking Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin). Moss finds $2 million among dead bodies in a secluded place in the desert and takes the money for himself. Bardem, hired to find the money (the satchel has a transponder in it) is hot on his heels. The movie follows the two men: Moss, a former Vietnam vet who is resourceful and thinks he can outrun Chiqurh, and Chiqurh, a sociopath who likes to make his victims bet on whether they live or not. Tommy Lee Jones plays Sheriff Bell, a weary lawman who tries desperately to reach Moss before Chiqurh. Woody Harrelson makes an appearance as a cohort of Chiqurh, hired to take him out. The suspense is top-rate and all through the movie.<br /><br />Beware, the movie is loaded with graphic violence, which may bother some. The acting is exceptional, especially Bardem and Brolin. Tommy Lee's not bad, either.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"The picture quality is absolutely amazing on this blu ray!  We had thought the normal DVD of ""Cars"" was good quality, but compared to this, it was nothing!  We love it!  You almost forget it's a cartoon the picture is so amazing!"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Having worked for a Canadian Beef producer utilizing a feed lot system, albeit some 35 years ago and on a significantly smaller scale than presented within Food, Inc., I am well aware of the challenges that Canadian farmers have faced. Even back then, there was concerns by the local farmers of the impact of the corporate farm on the food industry. I doubt any of them, however, would have imagined to what extent our Federal Governments would have facilitated the deterioration of public health and food safety in their support of corporate food production, over that of the family farm operation.<br /><br />On a brighter note, I very much appreciated that there remains a glimmer of hope that we, as consumers, and in cooperation with the dedication and courage of individual farmers who are willing to speak up and return to traditional farming methods and values, have the power to right what has become an unimaginable wrong within North American society.<br /><br />I found Food, Inc., to have offered a fair representation of food production in North America, and I urge every consumer to see this film.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:30 Mins<br /><br /></span>Prometheus, thanks to a viral video campaign and a stunning trailer, captured audiences attention before it was even released.<br />This is an advertisement for the David 8 - the most advanced android ever made by Weyland Companies.<br /><br />Not only does this show Ridley Scott's stunning attention to detail, but also Michael Fassbender's (often called the greatest actor of his generation) brilliant acting.<br /><br />Watch Prometheus and judge it for yourself.<br />You will not be disappointed."
B0006989TE	1.0	b	This movie was like so dumb. Save your money. Seriously!
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	Great HP story, lousy DVD quality. I'll be calling Warner on Monday to complain.  In the mean time, I'll be returning what appears to be an extremely poorly compressed DVD to the store for a replacement.  I don't expect any difference in quality, but the stores need to know. Even my home video DVD's look better than this.  Maybe I should see if I can find HP OOTP on VHS. It certainly would look better than the DVD.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	Robert Downey, Jr. is terrific as Iron Man. His character, billionaire Tony Stark, builds weapons for the U.S. military. Stark doesn't even realize that it is his own WMD's that are being used for 'evil' until he (spoiler alert) is kidnapped early on by Afghan rebels. Downey is absolutely terrific as Stark. It is the actor's ability to balance humor with drama that actually carries the film all the way through to its' conclusion. The special effects are also dynamite, and the Iron Man suit creation is awesome. The plot has good twists, and there is enough great excitement (in the first hour especially) and light humorous touches that also keep me glued to the screen. Like all movies about good vs. evil, though, there are usually some problems as to how the director defines the 'bad guys'. The action begins in Afghanistan when Stark is kidnapped (no more spoilers, I promise). The men who kidnap Stark are supposedly rebels, and at first they are pretty frightening. But low and behold, when all is said and done, we discover that these 'Arab' rebels are nothing more than more stereotypical villains that we have seen in countless movies before, and they are not very smart, either. You even have the bald, steely-eyed Arab who has murder in his eyes (and lucky for us he speaks pretty good English). As for villains other than the predictable 'Arabic' bad guy, the writers have thrown somebody else into the pot, so that is a relief. Still, I wasn't content with the supporting cast. Terrance Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, does a good job with what he has, which isn't a lot. And the always gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts (Stark's assistant), is engaging to look at. Her light humor and sex-appeal adds a lot to what could've been a heavy-handed story involving all men and action. Unfortunately she seems to have little to do. Every great superhero film that I know of always takes advantage of the 'love interest' (Lois Lane, Mary Jane Watson, etc.). I hope she will have more to do in the sequel. The same goes for Howard. And Jeff Bridges, wearing a bald head and a beard, is excellent as always, and a perfect foil for Downey's Stark. But it is Downey who really holds the film together. And despite the stereotypes and an action-packed ending that gives me pause, or a sense of deja vu, as if I had seen that same ending in some other summer movie last year, and the lack of things to do for Howard and Paltrow (is there some kind of romantic entanglement between Pepper and Tony Stark?), 'Iron Man' really is a great popcorn film. Downey gives us pretty much a 'one-man show', and he is nearly perfect.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Received the DVD set promptly and in excellent shape. The DVD's play with no problems.
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	I could not wait until this movie was finished. It seemed to go on and on and on..... Enough said. Do not waste your money.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	This was the first movie I watched on Amazon, and it was great. I had no problems with sound or video quality.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KEHAFI"">Fireproof</a><br />This movie was about as ""real life"" as movies get! As one watches the steady disintegration of Caleb's marriage; the heated arguments with his wife, the growing hostility and the lack of respect they show one another, it is easy to relate to their situation. You see Caleb's fascination with pornography and how his wife is getting wrapped up in an emotional affair with one of her co-workers and you can totally relate to their pain. Just when all seems to be headed for certain disaster, in his desperation he agrees to try something his father suggests, the Love Dare. Your heart breaks for him when his efforts to show his love and remorse are spurned by his wife and her ""friend"" at work gets more of her attention than her husband. But God is at work behind the scenes and He alone gives Caleb the tenacity to keep working on the marriage when all seems a futile effort. Caleb comes face to face with his addiction to pornography and is willing to make his wife his first priority. That is the pivotal point in the healing of a broken relationship.<br />What a beautiful story of ""beauty from ashes""! It gives hope to couples struggling with the issues so prevalent in marriages today. This is not a ""cheesy chick flick"". It's a real life movie that will quickly pull you into the emotion of a troubled marriage spiraling out of control. Add to that the intense scenes of Caleb's dangerous job as a firefighter, and you have a family friendly movie that speaks directly to where many people are at today!"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is a GREAT DVD!  There wasn't any part of the show that I didn't like.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"I recently purchased this DVD and Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity. My family and I just couldn't stop laughing! Jeff's DVD's are non-stop laughter. Now we want to watch Jeff perform live when he makes an appearance near us!! If you are like me and like to buy DVD""s to watch over and over again, you won't go wrong by buying these. I'm even giving these to my sister for xmas. What else do you give the person who has everything?"
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I originally watched this movie from a cd set from the library, but loved it so much I had to buy it on Amazon to watch again and share it with friends and family. And trust me, I'm not a person who generally watches a movie more than once. It is an HBO mini series, so it's very long, but I couln't wait to be able to have time to watch the next disc.<br /><br />Everything about this movie was excellent from the history lesson, to the dialogue, to the authenticity. Just a word of caution though, this was made using the dialect of the time so you have to really be attentive. Also, the character portraying John Adams speaks in very low tones. This is a movie you really have to watch and be involved in to get the true meaning and experience.<br /><br />If you care anything about the founding of America or are a history buff, then this is a must see movie. It's also a great teaching resource for childern. Just make sure they are not on a sugar high before watching and be ready to explain some things.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	This movie is totally lame. It's use of fantasy was generic and inappropriate. Some of the special effects were great, but did not always make sense, as if it were a visual for visual sake. I was looking forward to the movie and was disappointed.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"""Cars"" is excellent! This is one of the year's best! This is Pixar's first film after winning the Oscar for their previous film ""The Incredibles"". This is cute, funny, and heartwarming. John Lasseter's (this is the fourth Pixar pic that Lasseter has directed) directing and Joe Ranft's (who the film is dedicated to) co-directing is excellent! The story by Ranft and Jorgen Klubien (who has also been involved with Pixar's 3 recent films ""A Bug's Life"" (1998), ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) & ""Monsters, Inc."" (2001) and the screenplay by Phil Lorin, Dan Fogelman, and Kiel Murray (who has also been involved with Pixar's 2 recent films ""Finding Nemo"" (2003) & ""The Incredibles"" (2004) is excellent! The music by Randy Newman (who won the Oscar for Best Original Song in 2001 for ""Monsters, Inc."") is excellent! The film editing by Ken Schretzmann (who has been involved with 2 Pixar films ""Toy Story 2"" & ""Monsters, Inc."") is excellent! The visual design of the film is beautiful and one of the best that I have seen in an CGI-animated film, even from Pixar."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Are Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriguez comic book geeks?  Yeah.  Bigtime.  Is it any wonder that they were able to talk the hesitant Frank Miller into making his pulp comic dynasty Sin City into a movie?  Porbably not.  They tried awfully hard and Rodriguez first treatment did make a pretty impressive splash with creator Miller.  Hence, a comic book movie is born.<br /><br />Probably the first comic book movie.<br /><br />Sure there's Batman and Superman and X-Men and Spider-Man and blah-de-blah-blah.  But one:  None of these movies were filmed by Tarrantino and Rodriguez and Frank Miller. Two: These movies were adaptions of comics turned into movies.  Sin City is a comic book turned into a comic book movie.  Hard to explain....unless you've seen it.  Miller is a great artist (he worked on the Marvel Limited series of Wolverine in the mid-80's) and he has a certain vision.  Rodriguez did not want this to be Frank Miller's Sin City as portrayed by Robert Rodriguez.  He wanted Frank Miller's Sin City.  Period.<br /><br />I think he got that and a helluva lot more.<br /><br />Do you need to be a Comic Book Geek to love this movie?  No.  It would help.  But it wouldn't be a prerequisite.  In fact, after viewing the movie, on having liked it, you may have a new-found appreciation of comics in general.<br /><br />To cut to the chase.  This is a dark and unseemly movie with dark and unseemly subject matter.  It moves like a hurricane.<br /><br />Dig it.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	Overrated... story adaptation was just weak and Kristen Stewart was the weakest part of the movie. Her accent was horrible and uninspired. Acting is a stretch as it is for her and then you add an English accent to the mix.... you get a catastrophe. Charlize and the other actors were great. Visuals were okay as well.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	"SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />The trailers were so lush and beautiful, you really expected an epically grand tale to be told here. And while the costumes, sets, and scenery were all breathtaking, the plot fell flat. Hard.<br /><br />Charlize Theron was lovely and psychotic, but everyone else was... bland. Kristen Stewart? Please. She is nowhere near as beautiful as Theron, let alone MORE beautiful. It's obvious the producers were banking on riding her ""Twilight"" tails and hoping Twi-hard fans would fill the theater. And while I enjoy Stewart as an actress, she is somewhat one-dimensional; she does well with dark, gritty, angsty movies. She's too sulky and reserved to make an endearing or likeable Snow White, even a tough one. Compare her with Lily Collins (""Mirror, Mirror"") who was both ridiculously beautiful AND exquisitely charming... there IS no comparison.<br /><br />There also seemed to be this wanna-be love triangle thingie between Snow White, the Huntsman, and William (Snow's childhood sweetheart/friend). But it never goes anywhere. Nobody falls in love with anybody. Nobody winds up with anybody. It didn't make sense. There's all this gazing and sighing and romantic introspection, and then... that's it. Huh?<br /><br />By the way, what is the white plaster-of-Paris stuff that Theron bathes in? Yes, it's striking and beautiful to watch, but WHAT is it? Milk? It's too thick and coating to be milk. Not sure what else it COULD be...<br /><br />In the end, the movie dragged on too long, tried to follow too many mini-plots (the Duke, the rebels, the dwarves, the fairy-critters, the scarred-face women), and ultimately felt exhausting and predictable. We know the fairy tale too well to be surprised by anything. I wished they'd veered away from the story everyone knows and thrown in some surprises. Somewhere. Something. Please! I still had about an hour of the film left, and I already knew what was coming; Snow White would fight the Queen, kill her, become Queen herself, happily ever after, tada. I was ready to turn it off at that point. Why watch the rest if I already knew what would happen?<br /><br />Sometimes a so-so movie is still entertaining enough that I'd say ""go ahead and watch it, just for the fun factor"". But I can't even say that about this one. Skip it and watch ""Mirror, Mirror"" instead. That movie was another disappointment, but at least it was fun to watch."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is easily one of the most talented entertainers today. He's funny just telling jokes, and then you almost forget he's alone on stage once the puppets come out. Simply great.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"This movie is an absolute must get.  It is one of the best movies you will possibly see and is amongst the best graphic novel based movies you will probably ever experiance.  The movie pays tribute to the great film Noir genre, throughout the movie, the director utilizes a series of predominantly black an white color palates while using color only for specific ""popping"" effect.<br /><br />This movie has a wonderful gritty, deep, feel that perfectly portrays the dark underworld that it is narrating.  The cast in the movie is phenominal, and the acting is amazing.  This movie has the best of all possible worlds in movie making.. it has violence, a deep story line, sex, and action that keeps you wanting more and more.  The beginning scene of the movie leave you begging for more, the end scene leaves you stunned and the middle is just unbelievably amazing.<br /><br />I have never read the graphic novel, seeing this movie certainly pushed me to go out and get it.  I absolutely loved this movie, and you will too, it is phenominal.. no plotholes here!  GO AND GET IT!!<br /><br />Just a note if you can get the unrated collector's edition.  Appearantly movie companies think that people want an edited, censored version.. WTF, I hate when movies are censored and edited so they can make the R cut.. Just give us the unedited movie to begin with with a choice in teh menu for the edited version.. But no, they feel the need to double dip and make double profit off you... Get the unrated version, it is worth the extra money."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Thanks for a great transaction.  The movie shipped fast, and came with wrapping on.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"As someone who grew up on a farm I knew a lot of this stuff but it's amazing how our world has changed in the 40 years since. So much isn't what it seems. The movie is highly recommended for anyone who cares about what they eat or the health of the planet or how corporations are eroding the quality of our lives. It's all in the name of profit margin and pleasing stockholders or CEOs. What we need is a whole lot more ""Undercover Boss."""
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	No matter how many times we watch this, something else always jumps out and makes us laugh even harder than before.  Jeff Dunham puts on a great show and his tapes are excellent.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I'll admit it, I'm a fantasy/comic book junkie.  Hey, that's okay, comic books are now in style and it seems as if a comic book movie is coming out every other month, with a fantasy movie coming out in the months between.  Having said that, I will also say I don't like a movie because it fits that criteria.  Two examples would be ""Hellboy"" and ""Daredevil""...two movies which could have been better but were unfortunately lacking.  This all leads me to ""Sin City"".  This movie is amazing.  You either love it or you hate it, I guess.  I loved it.  It combines film noir with a very comic book feel, and extremely true to the original Frank Miller graphic novels.  A great cast in a very well filmed and written movie.  Robert Rodriguez is amazing, and his talents are put to the test here.  The recut, extended, unrated DVD is also amazing.  I'm not going to admit that I (cough) pirate movies, but my normal DVD attitude is ""why buy the cow...""  Well folks, this is a cow worth buying.  If you loved the movie, you'll love the DVD.  It has too many extras to name them all, but they're all worth it.  You get to see all 4 stories as they were originally meant to be AND the way it was released in theatres AND in a green screen version that lets you see what was real and what was CGI AND with an optional audio track from the premiere audience that saw this movie...not to mention tons of interviews with cast and crew.  This is the reason to buy a DVD!"
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	I loved this movie. Yes it was Snow White but it takes it to a different level because it has so much more details and action in it. I would so buy this movie. Would so tell people about it and to watch it.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	"I purchased a supposedly ""new"" dvd. It was rewrapped in plastic, not manufacture wrap! The booklet insert was missing. Im very dissatisfied that i did not recieve a new product! it was going to be a Christmas gift, but i can not give a used item!!!!"
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	The first time I saw Jeff Dunham I thought this guy is funnier than a lot of big name comics.  This DVD just reinforces that.  This is just about the funniest stand-up I have ever seen.  You can tell that he's having as much fun as you are.  Not afraid that he has to be PC, what with Achmed the Dead Terroist and the bit on signer for the deaf at one of his shows (won't give more away here).  He's getting better with age.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"One of the things that I always liked about the Harry Potter book series was Rowling's writing, since, while at times simplistic and not as detailed as other fantasy writers, she was able to make it more accessible and reader-friendly as opposed to Tolkien who's one of the more clinical writers and very, shall we say, ""scholarly"" in his writing? However, I found the 5th book, the Order of the Phoenix, the most trying to read since the length didn't translate to pacing and Harry's caps lock-laden outbursts were quite annoying. So while we have the shortest movie based on one of the longest books, it's quite successful at the adapting of it...most of the time.<br /><br />Year 4 ended with Harry Potter being witness to Voldemort's resurrection and upon returning, the Ministry of Magic has been renouncing him and Dumbledore by saving they're all lies. With wizards disappearing and adults who don't want to include him despite his needed involvement, Harry finds the 5th year with an incredibly troublesome teacher, and having to teach his classmates how to protect themselves at what's coming.<br /><br />As far as plot progression goes, Order of the Phoenix is the least advancing of the stories so far since we do find out some things but, with knowledge of how the books end, they're not as substantial and it's the latter books that are the most plot heavy. But the main issue regarding Phoenix is that it's a bit too jumpy with many scenes getting at most a couple of scenes before we're off somewhere. For example, in the book when Harry arrives at 12 Grimmauld Place, the book gives us time to settle in and gives some breathing time; here it's a couple of scenes before we're off to Harry's hearing. While yes, the book does cut out some excess, it does so with almost breakneck pace as if someone was timed and had to get in as much as they could before the buzzer rang.<br /><br />However, the actors are more confident in the roles with several big name British actors such as Imelda Staunton nailing the perfect Umbridge as well as Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman and Michael Gambon still doing fine work. And while castmates Rupert Grint and Emma Watson feel even more<br />""supporting character mode"" than ever, Daniel Radcliffe does a good job at doing that frustration of being too old to shrug off responsibility while being too young to ignore it without being a big crybaby like he was in the books (man I wanted to smack him when I was reading). The scene stealer is Evanna Lynch who probably does the perfect Luna Lovegood and the book's best new character was thankfully the best cast as well.<br /><br />With its exciting finale complete with some of the best effect work the series has had (but Grawp, the big giant is bad; not Scorpion King bad but still), the film may not be the best Potter but it's still an enjoyable watch anyway."
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	The Departed is pretty good, but not because its large cast is good or because of Martin Scorcese's direction.<br /><br />Its good because the original Chinese film its copied from, Infernal Affairs (2004) was a superior plot.<br /><br />The story is about two impersonators who have infiltrated the Boston crime scene. One is employed by the Police Department to find any moles who might have penetrated the force. The other works for Boston Mobster Frank Costello, not related at all to the Mafioso who rapped his knuckles on a congressional desk in the fifties during a televised hearing about organized crime.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson plays Costello and wrecks the movie pretty much. In interviews, Nicholson said he wasn't inclined to be in the film because the Costello role was little more than a cameo. But Scorcese had the part built up for Nicholson, hurting the film in the process.<br /><br />The film is a tightly wound tale of intrigue about moles inside the Boston department. Leo De Caprio and Matt Damon play the spies. De Caprio is better than Damon but not by much. De Caprio knots up his forehead too often in order to be taken seriously as a slightly troubled cop.<br /><br />There's a certain amount of advanced technology to sleuth the mystery the audience already knows the answer to. But this is a great script.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's Costello is over the top, damaging a pretty good film substantially. De Caprio is off his mark too.<br /><br />But this is the best Scorcese film in years, better than Gangs of New York or the Aviator, both of which were directed by Scorcese and both of which featured Leonardo De Caprio.<br /><br />Nicholson is so awful and such a gargoyle, he reminds me of Burl Ives, who was terrible as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1958. Nicholson is almost always miscast and overacting these days. I think the last decent film he did was the Postman Always Rings Twice in roughly 1980. He hasn't been good in anything since, but they keep paying him as if he's a bankable star.<br /><br />Other actors in what is supposed to be an ensemble film include Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Krista Dalton. Dalton is a newcomer and is quite good. But Baldwin, Farmiga and Wahlberg don't get enough time to act with Nicholson chewing scenery all the time.<br /><br />The film, due to its extraordinary plot and a series of film surprises, is quite good, despite everything.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is a must-see, extremely well done historical series worth every minute of viewing time. The acting and production quality are top-notch.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	Despite the flood of negative reviews, I found this movie to be highly moving and interesting. It is the first film I see from this poet and so I had no pre-conceived notions going into the theater. I didn't read much from the critics as well but was adviced by a friend to see it, with no comment.  I fully agree with one of the review : the metaphor about contemporary politics/religion. Read: GWB vs. fears, need for a community of myths, and ultimately the question on how far are we prepared to get security. Picture and colors are exceptionnal, cast is just great, no time wasted in the story telling. Congratulations to the director for the taking the risk of making a multiple level-reading film with so much more staying power than may be readily apparent at first glance. I am afraid though that many people missed it.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	This is an AWESOME movie!  I will watch it again and again!  My whole family loved it!  I do not recommend it for young children though.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	It's a good movie overall but Kristen Stewart has the emotional capacity the size of a teaspoon. She just always looks the same and has the same facial expressions and her fake accent sort of goes in an out. The accent will be stronger at certain times and weaker in the next scene. Don't get me wrong, I do like this movie, I just think the main character was sort of lacking well, character. I would still recommend this movie to anyone who's interested though because despite K-Stew being a crappy actress it's still a good movie and provides an interesting take on the classical Snow White story. So, overall, good movie and action packed!
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	One thing people need to clearly understand about this film is that Ridley Scott has stated on several occasions that this is not a prequel to Alien. It does hint at several points through out the movie (ending mostly) things that might tie into the movie Alien, but it is a completely different storyline. I personally watch the film with low expectations (which is what I would recommend for some). Some people will quite frankly hate this movie. I am a huge fan of the first 2 Alien films; the others clearly should have never been made. Ridley Scott is a brilliant imaginative person, with the film Prometheus you see stunning landscapes, which will set a perfect stage for an alien world. The futuristic technology is very believable and alone makes the movie worth watching. The dark-grim feel of the movie reminds me very much of the film Alien and delivers the same suspenseful feel that Alien brought. The actors and actresses are brilliant and are clearly the strong point of the movie. Several people may be bothered by some of the characters behavior, but this is a movie (and yes people do stupid things in movies). Over all the performances are very well done.<br />I would say the weaker points of the movie are parts of the storyline. Some people may be bothered by the idea that we came to existence because of an alien race. Once you get past this idea and the except that it is clearly a science fiction movie the film can be quite enjoyable. I find the new alien characters very fascinating and by the end of the film I want to know more about them. As said before it's a new storyline, don't be upset that we didn't get all the questions answered we had about the movie Alien. After all what makes a good sci-fi movie is the unknown, and of course always leaves us with wanting more and we will probably know more in the 2nd Prometheus film. I give Prometheus 3 out of 4 stars.
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	I wish I could give a better rating to such an anticpated movie.  Indiana Jones 4 looked good in the previews, and the characters and action stand out very well.  This time, Indy is fighting the Russians during the Cold War, and this works well, nothing bad.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with this story, it became too goofy, and seemed slapped together after almost twenty years since part three.  Some of the action sequences are bad (fighting evil CGI ants-please), and without telling you the ending (which really ruined the movie for me), I think Indy 4 falls short of the standards in the first three films.<br /><br />I am looking forward to a part 5 and then they need to call it quits.  Harrison Ford is almost 69 years old at the time of this review, so finishing part 5 will hopefully come sooner, rather than later.
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	This film was such a HUGE disappointment to me, and I am not the kind of person who typically criticizes films. For those who have read this book (which is phenominal, by the way!), this movie is missing absolutely everything. And for those who haven't read the book, this movie is completely and utterly confusing. There is no character development whatsoever, not even with Ron & Hermione. I think Luna and Neville had more lines than 80% of the key characters. This movie is missing everything important, yet it is so jumbled and has so much crammed into it that your brain is spinning. I don't get it. It was such a mess. I really hope the last two movies will at least somewhat live up to the amazing books!!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"I don't think Pixar has gone wrong yet, and that is certainly true with ""Cars.""  Lightning McQueen is on the fast-track to being a big star (literally, he's a race car).  However, after finding himself stranded in run-down little Radiator Springs--a once-prosperous old Route 66 town that fell off the map when the Interstate bypassed it--he realizes the importance of slowing down, and how much it matters to care for others."
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	So, this was the movie that begun the summer season on 2008 and boy, it started with a bang. Iron Man collected more than 300 million USD just in North America and was praides almost universally.<br /><br />And with good reason, Iron Man is a very solid film, a proyect that in paper, in 2007 was secondary to other Marvel franchises, as Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4 or X-Men. Today, i belive that with SpiderMan, it must be the good looking son in hearts of Marvel Excecutives.<br /><br />Directed in a very fresh way by Jon Favreau, Iron Man is a movie that took a very serious approach (serious, not dark) to it's source material. Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice as Tony Stark and embodies it with masterful audacity. he embodies the character and elevates it to the real world.<br /><br />the other members of the cast do ggod jobs from what they have to work, but from the script, they are secondary to Stark, who fills the screen for 95% of the film.<br /><br />I belive that the reviews should be done at the moment of the first seeing, (to measure first impact) and also after several viewings, because you can discover new details every watch, and after 5 or 6 times, a whole different picture might emerge. i can say that after multiple viewings, Iron Man is a solid, appealing and well excecuted piece of entertaining, but no perfect. Tha main problem with the film is the lack of an enemy that is in the same tone with the rest of the film, very similar to what hurted Batman Begins: in the last portion of the film, the to-that-moment-realistic and belivable, villain says bye bye to the real context of the movie and says hello to super-villain Mountain. I think that with a more serious and realistic nemesis, Iron Man could be in the League of The Dark Knight, Spider Man 2 or X Men 2 as the best the genere has to offer.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a very good movie, and another proof that Comic Book Movies are really what are holding Hollywood Economy in relative order...just see the top ten box-office movies, and count how many are from a genere that were once only for kids and geeks, but in the last 10 or 20 years, it has gained the respect of the most talented filmakers, and specially, of the adult audience all around the world.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Same version as on tv but the unrated version was much beter.
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	This movie was 2 hours long well let me tell you it felt like 4 hours.  It was slow and very boring.<br />Everyone said it was such a great movie.  Well I am glad I didn't see this in the theater.  I don't see<br />what the big hype is about Kristen Stewart.  I think they could have found a prettier Snow White.  That<br />might have saved her relationship with Robert Pattinson.  Overall not really worth your time unless you want to take a nap.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"I have never laughed so hard in all my life!! Jeff Dunham is truly the BEST ventriloquist/comedian out there. I loved all his ""guys in the box"", Walter and Achmed being my favorites. I've watched this dvd over and over and still laugh out loud! I can't wait for the next one!!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie is one of my favorites!  Although I do not like the bluecollar comedy tour, Mater is a hilarious character!!  The movie itself is fast-paced enough for kids, but the story is grown up enough for adults. And the animation is awesome!  I especially like the link to the demise of Route 66 within this wonderful, funny, cute little movie!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	A real great historic series, worthwhile seeing to understand the USA creation, its foundations, its motives  and its flaws.The actors are spectacular and so credible !<br /><br />Wish we had more mini-series of that  superior quality....
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	These reviews speak for themselves. This movie will clarify the confusing world of food and unmask the secrets we'd never know with out this film. I thought I was a well educated adult, married to a chef, college graduate-but this film has so much fabulous information that you can apply to your life. I can't sing the praises of this documentary enough. SEE IT!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	This is a different type of film.  Half way through it was a 3 star flick but I slowly changed my mind.  There are boogiemen in the woods.  The villagers are trapped in the village by their fears and that is what this film is about-- Fear.  Its about how people react and treat their fears and what they're afraid of.  Colors are used as symbols and ultimately the town elders are faced with what they fear the most-- the monsters in the red hoods.  The elders try as they might to hide from the red monsters are faced with them.........<br /><br />The village lives innocently, just as you would imagine quakers living.  The film is about their innocence too and whether it is really possible to stay innocent when isolated.  Unfortunately the villagers must remain isolated or be faced with the monsters they fear.  To travel to another town would mean going through the woods which is their domain........<br /><br />Like I said, the film is different.  If you are looking for an action flick, skip this one.  If you appreciate things of a poetic nature, this would be your type of film.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is seriously the funniest thing you'll ever see. PERIOD. Just.. don't trust Jeff with your lotion...Don't get it? Watch the dvd.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This mini-series was very well done.  It takes the viewer back into that time period and let's him or her see the people who had the foresight to start something the world had never seen before.<br />We also see Adams as a Father and Husband.  We get to know his strength and his flaws. I hightly recommend this to history buffs and just plain movie buffs as well.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Good For Troubled Marriages and for those couples who don't have GOD in their lives. Couples should sit down and watch it together.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Insanity is ridiculous and awesome! I've only done 1 week of it and already feel amazing. I'm hoping to actually see results within the next week but I just feel incredible. The DVDs arrived very quickly as well, before I was actually expecting it. LOVE IT
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	We first saw this movie in an older theater, and the quality was horrible!  I saw enough to know I liked it, and was right to get it on Blu-ray. Robert Downey, Jr. has gotten better with age! :-)
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	I've read all the reviews and bought Insanity to try. I've tried this for two weeks now and I have to say it is hard just like they say! I've already done p90x for 1 month and gained 4 pounds (of muscle I'm sure)... but that is not my original goal so I knew I needed more cardio but still with light toning. shaun T works every muscle but espcially your butt and abs A LOT!! -which I love because I feel like I'm doing cardio and toning all in one video! I think this is why most people on here who have knee problems can not do this program. It's fast pace with lots of jumping and quick moves, so if you have knee problems you can modify the moves. Meaning, you can still do the moves and work out but just go slower so you dont injure yourself. I myself have a bad knee but I wear a brace everytime and I'm fine- If I dont wear it: I'm asking for trouble!<br /><br />All n'all it's a great workout- the eating plan that comes with the dvds is great too. I already eat 6 small meals a day- so it had great recipes to follow but not time consuming. If you read the whole thing, you still learn a lot even if you think you already know everything about healthy eating. It basically feels like you have a personal trainer helping you to lose weight- only thing is- you have to push yourself. You have to work out 6 days a week and eat 6 small meals a day plus vitamins and a recovery drink. Its hard but after two weeks it will feel like a habit- anyone can do it!<br /><br />To me- this is harder than p90x and I thought that was hard! I like this because Shaun T motivates you in the videos and there are two parts- month 1 and month 2. Month 1 is just 30 minutes per day but month 2- is so hard because it's an hour long! I've done regular cardio for an hour before- running, p90x, yoga.. etc.. but this kind of cardio... it is going to leave you screaming sometimes if you push yourself hard enough. but in the end... you feel so good!!!! Since I've already been exercising for a long time prior to getting this series I started week 1 doing 30 minute dvds and now i'm doing week 2 but doing the month 2 hours long dvds.. I just dont want to get tired of it too quickly and change things up. I'm sure you can also incorporate hip hop abs one day a week to replace an Insanity workout but its all up to you! As long as you work out hard and eat healthy, of course you will loose weight. Stay Strong!!!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This DVD is great and I wasn't able to stop laughing. Jeff really has an interesting perspective on every day happenings and puts his hilarious spin on it. I highly recommend this one.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	"Every Potter movie has had their strengths and weaknesses but (aside from the first movie) they all require either reading the books and/or viewing the previous films to make any sense at all.<br /><br />Even though the book series is one of the biggest sellers, if not the biggest seller of all time...there are many people who haven't read them and don't have a clue who Harry Potter is.<br /><br />These films contain so many holes and blank areas they should have minimum requirements in order to view. Even with the books and the films and the games (and the toys) under my belt, I found myself scratching my head wondering 'what the hell?' is going on/happening with this story.<br /><br />This story marches right on through.  It was good, but it left me with the feeling of being hurried along.  I agree with the ""Cliff Notes"" review by one of the previous posters. The sense of wonder and amazement  that we experience through the eyes of our growing witches and wizards is restricted to a paper airplane in the shape bird at the beginning of our first class.<br /><br />My usual gripe with the films is that the wealth of talent is largely surpressed.  Helena Bonham Carter is thrilling but has maybe 3 lines and 3 minutes of screen time...if that much. Alan Rickman's Severus Snape is always delicious and never disappointing.  More...please?  Then there is the venerable Maggie Smith.  The routine and increasing neglect of her character is criminal.<br /><br />These are movies.  They contain rich characters...can we please see them or know something about them?<br /><br />The portrayal of Dolores Umbridge is worthy of an Oscar nod ... but probably won't get it because the Academy at large won't be able to figure out what is happening and why.<br /><br />Please, please, please give these great actors a role worth performing...the potential that is achievable yet never reached is aggravating as it is heart-breaking. Let us fall in love with the movies.  We all fell in love with the books as books, but film is a different medium.  Writing a larger role for Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman doesn't mean you have to change the goal of the story...you just don't have to follow the book page by page."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This year instead of going to a parade and/or fireworks on July 4th, I spent the holiday weekend watching the John Adams HBO Miniseries DVD.  (How more patriotic can one get?)<br /><br />I would highly recommend this miniseries for any time of the year.  The acting is extraordinary and the series actually makes reviewing history fun.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	My daughter read this story in 2nd grade and now as a young working professional enjoyed it all over again.  There is a lesson to be learned by both young children and adult viewers alike.  I recommend this as a story to be shared with families at the time of year when our attention turns to how many and how much, but this story jolts us back to the real spirit of sharing and caring.
B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	"""Expelled"" by Ben Stein is an interesting look at the world of science and academia resists efforts to allow the discussion of Intelligent Design into the classroom.  Stein interviews scientists on both sides of the issue and the dvd covers several topics:<br /><br />1.  Why evolutionary scientists believe the way they do.<br />2.  Why intelligent design scientists believe the way they do.<br />3.  Examples of professors who were expelled from their work because of their intelligent design views.<br />4.  Connection between evolutionary theory and Nazism (this is sure to rile some folks!).<br />5.  Stein (a Jew) visiting the Nazi death camps of World War 2 and reflecting on the atrocities performed there.<br /><br />While discussing a very serious and divisive topic, the dvd manages to include several instances of humor.  Depending on your point of view, you will either like or dislike the comedy.<br /><br />A controversial dvd that has already stirred a lot of debate, people will either love or hate it.<br /><br />Despite your point of view on evolutionary theory, the dvd is recommended."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This movie started it all for me. Robert Downey Jr. is great as Iron Man and this is a great movie!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Isane. The title of this workout was named so well. It's not easy, but it's not impossible. I LOVE this workout program. Shawn T keeps you up with motivation and when I am working out I don't even realize how much time I have bee doing a workout, because I just keep MOVING. I am only on day 9 (as of 8/30/12) and I can see my upper abs have some form. You get out what you put into this workout. And 100% is the only number you should care about.<br /><br />It comes with the wall calendar and the meal plan with is easy to follow. You have to count your calories, which for me was difficult, but it is also helping me with discipline as well.<br /><br />Try the challenge. Don't like it? Quit on day 60. You will never get bored with this program. I do the same dvds over and over but each time I try to beat my previous time. It's a competition - against myself.<br /><br />Five STARS!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"I would rate this movie ""Cars"" very highly.  I gave my first copy of this DVD to my daughter and instantly missed it.  We needed to have it here in our house for our grandson's visits.  This is his most favorite movie in the world.  He's 2 1/2 years old and loves all the characters.  There are so few movies out there that are fit for your children that when one is finally available we should all celebrate.  Yay for ""Cars""!"
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This like ever other Harry Potter movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughtout the whole movie.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	M. Night Shyamalan is the master!<br /><br />This movie is excellent! As every M. Night movie is.<br />Great characters, great acting and a unusual, never been done before story!<br /><br />Never pass up the chance to see a M. Night Shyamalan classic!
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I received the 2-Disc DVD set for Christmas this year.<br />The plot was faced-paced and the scenes action packed.<br />Five stars. Robert Downey Jr. could read excerpts of<br />the phone book and I'd be mesmerized. I adore him. Fans<br />of this dark-eyed, soulful man will not be disappointed.<br />As a personal aside, I would have rather seen someone<br />else play the Pepper Potts role, but that is because I'm<br />not a Paltrow fan. Her delivery was fine, but I don't<br />care for her flat, deadpan affect.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Excellent movie.  Every married couple whether they have been married for a month or 20 years should see this movie.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Love the DVD.  Got it just in time to watch it a dozen times with my grandson before Christmas!! It is his FAVORITE movie....THANKS!<br />Happy New Years!<br />Lesli&lt;>&lt;
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Although a remake this is a great movie.  The plot is full of twists and keeps you captivated during the whole movie and the casting and directing are superb.<br /><br />I will not got into details as I do not want to ruin the movie for the ones that have not seen it yet.  I will jusst say that it is a mob and police movie.  I should warn that there is a lot of graphic violence so if someone has underage kids or does not like seeing violence then maybe you should stay away from it.<br /><br />All in all a great movie that you will enjoy
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"I think that when you take the longest Harry Potter book and turn it into the shortest Harry Potter film, that a large number of complaints by fans as to what has been cut will be inevitable after they watch ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  Not that this means that the legions of fans will be bitterly disappointed by the film version, but rather that there will be regrets over not getting to see favorite scenes on the screen.  For example, Quidditch is completely out of the film, denying Ron of his best moments in the sun (start singing ""Weasley is our king"").  So do not be surprised when your mind keeps shifting to what has been cut and distracting you from time to time while watching this summer's latest blockbuster.<br /><br />When last we left our hero, Harry fell victim to a trap to bring back Lord Voldermort, which cost Cedric Diggory his life.  The Ministry of Magic wants things hushed up, but Dumbledore tells the students at Hogwarts that Diggory was murdered and Lord Voldermort murdered him.  As this fifth film opens Harry and his wicked cousin Dudley are attacked by Dementors.  Harry uses his wand to defend them and is summarily expelled from Hogwarts for using magic in front of a muggle.  The good news is that Harry gets reinstated, but the bad news is that the Ministry of Magic uses the opportunity to appoint Dolores Umbridge,  Senior Undersecretary at the Ministry, as the school's new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.  However, Umbridge teaches only the theory and not the practice because she insists Harry is a liar and there is nothing the students need to learn to defend themselves from.  Then things get progressively worse.<br /><br />""The Order of the Phoenix"" was the most maddening book to read, not because it was the longest, but because I detest Dolores Umbridge.  As far as I am concerned she makes Voldermort look good, because he knows he is evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty inside, while Umbridge thinks the ends justify the means.  She is puritanical, sadistic and hypocritical.  If there were not going to be children reading this review I would tell you what I really think of her.  Suffice it to say, she makes me sick and I do not even take pleasure in loving to hate her, which is why my only requirement going into the film is that the Weasley Twins get their moment of glory when they become the disloyal opposition to the new order at Hogwarts.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe continues to have the tote the heavy load in these films as Harry, with Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley being reduced more and more often to reaction shots while Emma Watson's Hermione Granger remains the Mistress of Exposition in these films.  Alan Rickman as Snape remains pitch perfect casting and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is also a joy to watch, but I discovered in this film that I really like Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore, mainly because he always plays up the character's intelligence and I find I prefer his interpretation to that of the late Richard Harris, forgive my heresy.  Imelda Staunton does not look as much like a toad as Umbridge does in the book, but she captures the character's detestability from start to finish.  We are always painfully aware how dangerous she is, whether she smiles or not.  Also, Evanna Lynch steals more scenes as Luna Lovegood than Katie Leung does as Cho Chang, and it is certainly interesting to see Neville (Matthew Lewis) towering over everybody, with Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) in the silent but strong role for the pivotal sextet.<br /><br />After seeing this film I raced home and got out my copy of the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/043935806X"">book</a> and starting cataloguing things that had been cut.  Such comparisons are, as I suggested up top, inevitable for anyone who has read the book.  At this point what I missed the most were some of the conversations between Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Umbridge where Minerva verbally flaws the Inquisitor.  The omission that I am focusing on the most is the whole bit about why Neville's family was a target of Voldermort (I agree with Harry: always say his name and thereby reduce its power), since that suggests implications for what will happen in the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225"">final book</a>, which gets released in just ten more days.  I also would have liked to have seen an over reaction to Harry discovering his father bullied Snape at Hogwarts.  My favorite part ends up being the impressive wizard's duel between Voldermort and Dumbledore.  Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg does a good job of whittling down Rowling's book and director David Yates does a competent job, but fans will simply want more.  Also, we know what happens in the next book and all of the bad things that happen in this film cannot help but seem inconsequential in comparison.  Plus, fans will be distracted by mining this film for clues as to what will happen in the last book."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Insanity is insanley good. Im on my 4th week and I do see results. It's not easy stay focused keep pushing and u wil get stronger.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	"Many people reviewing this movie seem to suffer from ""Star Wars Syndrome"" -- in other words, the originals were beyond reproach and the new ones were so woefully bad that a team of chimps could have written better stories. In fact, ANYONE could have done better! Nothing good about the new movies - not one thing.<br /><br />But the ORIGINALS -- why, they were written, directed and produced by God himself, so flawless were they! It's amazing how Lucas was able to pull off three flawless Star Wars films (with the possible exception of Ewoks), and yet he can do nothing right today.<br /><br />And so it goes with Indiana Jones. Blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />People have criticized the plot device in this movie. They can't quite come to terms with such a ""supernatural element."" But the original movies -- why, they were just fine! The opening of the ark? The worship service in the Temple of Doom (removing beating hearts, anyone)? The healing power of the Holy Grail? No problem. In fact, we see it every day. But ALIENS -- can't quite stomach that, even though they were all over pop culture in the fifties and fit in well with the period.<br /><br />This movie, instead of just making stuff up, follows the structure of the first three films. It incorporates many supernatural elements with which we are acquainted-- crystal skulls, UFOs, Nazca lines in Peru, Area 51, and even the legendary El Dorado. Everything fits in nicely, though the plot is a bit more convoluted than the first three films.<br /><br />When did so many people stop enjoying movies and resort to being so critical? I imagine if this had been the first breakthrough movie, made in 1981, and ""Raiders"" was the new 2008 film, it would be criticized beyond reason:<br /><br />""'Raiders' is just more of the same. The plot was non-existent; Indy had to find a headpiece that would point him to the location of the ark by using the sun's rays. For some reason he's able to simply escape from an underground chamber full of CGI snakes after being sealed up, ostensibly for all eternity. At one point Indy goes underneath a truck going 50 mph and gets back on to fight! And at the end of the movie all credibility was lost when they opened the ark and the bad guys were destroyed -- what a cop-out! Aside from the relationship between Indy and Marion, the characters were poorly-drawn, one-dimensional caricatures -- especially the cartoon Nazis. Lucas has lost it and Spielberg has seen better days.""<br /><br />You see?<br /><br />In fact, before this movie was released I asked a friend if he was planning to see it. The reply: ""I don't think so. Been there, done that."" As if, after nearly twenty years, one more movie was just too much to handle. Amazing! This same person probably hasn't missed a single Bond movie in the same twenty years (talk about ""been there, done that"")!<br /><br />Take the criticisms with a grain of salt. This movie was made for one reason -- public demand. There are four elements that make a good Indiana Jones movie: George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Harrison Ford and John Williams. Lucas's plot is better than anything I -- or any of the other critics -- could have plausibly come up with. Spielberg's direction is great (though not spectacular, as in ""Raiders""). Harrison Ford is fantastically fit -- in fact, were it not for the grey hair, he hardly looks much older than he did during ""Last Crusade."" And John Williams's eerie score is excellent as always. This movie fits in well, in tone and in feel, with the other movies and is a worthy successor. Is it as good? I'd say it's at least as good or better than ""Temple of Doom."" But that's the point -- it doesn't have to be -- it's its own movie, designed to entertain and nothing more.<br /><br />This movie was thoroughly entertaining to me; I'm glad I can still enjoy movies without being overly critical. I recognize it for what it is -- just a fun movie. That's all it is. Not the Second Coming.<br /><br />See this movie. Enjoy. Welcome back, Indiana Jones!"
B005ZMUQCK	2.0	b	** 1/2 Cars looks stupid and crazy unlike any Pixair movies.Once agian the water cycle is idotic and more crazy than Chicken Little.Talking cars, a stupid race.....I don't think so....I don't think so.....&lt;grin>Although I put **2 1/2 stars because the animation is WONDERFUL.I like the widscreen previews but it's sooooooooooooooo0 stupid that's why I put the half.That's all I can say.STUPID. STUPID. STUPID. STUPID. and don't forget....STUPID.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"I am Irish and I grew up in Boston. Whenever a movie is set in Boston, I simply cannot enjoy it if the accents are off -- it ruins the whole experience for me. Those of us who know the regional accents (and there are many) can be very harsh when sizing up those actors who attempt the local patois. Wahlberg and Damon are from Massachusetts, so they get a bye. Leo DiCaprio does an okay job; I understand that Wahlberg told him he'd be laughed off the screen if he didn't manage an appropriate accent. Jack Nicholson, though, is terrible! He kind of drifts in and out of his accent. There is also no way I bought him as an Irish crime boss. They are way more menacing and scary. Trust me.<br />Despite Nicholson's performance, though, I really enjoyed the movie. It is worth watching for the interplay between Wahlberg and Damon alone -- I got the feeling that Mark has always wanted to pop Matt and he gets to do it big-time here. Unlike some people, I loved the ending. It's all about retribution . . . the Irish never forget. And, we really do say ""Sorry for your troubles"" at wakes! Lots of nice touches like that made this an authentic enough portrayal of Boston. I subtracted one star for Nicholson, but overall I think Scorcese did a ""wicked good"" job."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I saw Jeff Dunham live in Seattle (way back when) and loved his act! I've been waiting for a DVD to come out and now I can laugh and enjoy my favorite ""Woozle"" whenever!"
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	I don't get why people are so hard on this movie. I guess it didn't live up to their expectations based on the previous movies. Well, I was never an Indiana fan and I never watched any of the previous movies. At least, not all the way through. So this was really my first movie to the series and I thought it was a lot of fun. The alien thing was kinda weird but it didn't stop me from liking the movie. So stop hating.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F12J3Y"">The Polar Express Presented in 3-D [Blu-ray</a>]This is a great film and in 3D as I presume it is was originally for is really something else, the sound quality is extremely good. Very enjoyable for the whole family and remember being region free it plays on all blu-ray machines."
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	"This is by far the worst harry potter film yet!!! Having read the book I was sickened by this movie. If you have read the book DON""T SEE THIS MOVIE rent it on redbox for a dollar, its all this movie is worth!!!!"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	everybody should see this. it shows the situation under which our food is being produced/engineered and the political implications this has.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Of course picture and sound were excellent throughout as expected from blu-ray. Movie was tons of fun and better than I had expected. Eagerly awaiting the 2nd installment and would definatelty recommend.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	...they nailed it.  As cool as the film was, that grey armour...clumsy, heavy, brutal...was the absolute true representation of a hero's outfit as portrayed in the comic.  We'll never see Wolverine in yellow, but we got Iron Man in grey.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	"I went into this movie expecting... well, not the worst, precisely, but certainly mediocrity.  Wild horses could not have kept my from a movie with this cast, but I didn't expect much, knew all that could go wrong.  What I got was far greater than even my most optimistic hopes: this is a movie that delivers in almost all aspects, and does a lot of things that are incredibly danged hard to find anywhere in cinema these days.<br /><br />SWATH is not only a rebuke to those who cast aspersions on Kristen Stewart's acting, but a powerful demonstration that a woman can carry a fantasy/action movie just fine, thanks.  Snow is amazing, and while her partnership (however you want to see it) with the Huntsman is one of the most wonderful, understated parts of the movie (again, SO hard to find, and so good), *nothing that she does is for him*.  The same goes for Ravenna, the ""evil"" queen - these are women who have been shaped by the hard world around them, yes, but become incredibly powerful and take control for themselves.  That in itself makes this movie a miracle, and the absolutely breathtaking visuals are just a fabulous bonus.<br /><br />(Also, when I say visuals, I do not just mean costumes, creatures, and settings: everyone in this movie is a *babe*.)"
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"I believe the documantary ""Expelled"" should be a part of all video libraries! I loved it!"
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"This was a great film.  My wife and I have a wonderful relationship, but I know that there is always room to improve.  I too work in a stressful environment similar to that of a firefighter and I know the daily stresses that go along with it.  After renting this movie, I actually purchased it along with 2 ""Love Dare"" books.  I am so excited to watch this with my wife and begin to take on the, ""Love Dare!"" She is going to be so surprised! May god bless your marriage like he has mine!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I bought these DVDs and these workouts are crazy.  I do like this program, just not when I'm doing it.  When I'm doing it, I think I must be insane to be doing this madness!  I'm 5 weeks in and am at or near the best cardio shape of my life (guy in his late 20s).  For me, it is crucial to stretch before the warmup of each DVD.  When I didn't stretch, I kept getting slight muscle strains, now I've started stretching before I start and everything is all good.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham's ""Spark of insanity"" is absolutely the best entertainment i have ever seen on the tv-screen. His way to interact with the public, constantly delivering heartstopping jokes about just about everything on the face of the earth (but mostly related to the USA) is really astounding.<br />I have seen this movie about 10 or 15 times just during the month of december, and i'm nog growing tired of it yet. It's a great source of jokes of you're going to have a party, or if you plan to invite some friends.<br /><br />To do what Je'fafa dunn-haaam dotcom does, is really sending sparks everywhere. But i would not call him insane, i would rather call him a genious."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"This is an excellent movie that all married couples should watch. Whether a husband and wife are getting along great or struggling with marriage issues, WATCH THIS MOVIE! Allow it to absorb. It may change your life. It is a great film that shows the natural struggles and challenges of being married. The movie is about a fireman who has always learned ""never leave your partner"" when fighting a fire. He learns to apply that phrase to his near-divorce marriage of 7 years. The husband is presented with a 40-day challenge (Love Dare) to try before deciding on a divorce. This movie goes directly hand-in-hand with the best-selling ""Love Dare"" book. Purchase both! The concept is based on a Christian perspective. This is a must see! :)"
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	One word, horrible, that's it. I don't review many movies but this one was a waste of time. I fell asleep during part of the movie. There was no point to the movie.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	I tried to watch, some of this mess last night, on the advice of one of my co-workers in which he said, was a pretty good flick.  Now, I'm asking myself why?  Why did he do this to me.  Most of the violent scenes, killings in this movie, are just plain ridiculous and stupid!!!<br /><br />For example, the one with the lesbian probation officer, did it make any sense to have her shot that many times like that?<br /><br />I mean, just plain OVER KILL!!  After that, and with the beheading (which he deserved) of the serial killer, I said, O.K. I HAD ENOUGH!!<br /><br />I took this B.S. out of my DVD player, put in Sade' Lovers Live concert DVD, to get my sanity back.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	Well, I guess this is the last of the Indiana Jones that I will watch. In the past the locations were real and so was the action. Oh well, so much for computer generated movies,need I say more?
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"This is a fantastic video if you love ventriloquism.  It also gives you the option to watch it censored or uncensored, so if there are children, they can also watch it and enjoy the magic that Jeff Dunham has to bring his puppets ""alive"".  You will find yourself watching and listening to the puppets themselves, forgetting that a human brings them to life.  Just a wonderful video."
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	Looking forward to a bit of Indiana Jones nostalgia, we rented this DVD with high hopes.  High expectations may be what thwarted us, but this one just didn't hold up to the original Indiana Jones trilogy.  There were dangerous insects, collapsing temples, car chases--all the requisite stuff for an Indy movie, but somehow the cleverness, the humor, and the heart were missing.  Interactions between Indy and his old girlfriend and her son were wooden and forced and didn't really get the viewer on board.  My favorite part was a sword fight between two men on fast-traveling, side-by-side jeeps, but much of the movie seemed like old stuff rehashed.  Harrison Ford is still Harrison Ford, though a bit older and grayer, and that was worth about 2 of the 3 stars.  Watch it if you must, but be forewarned that it is only a shadow of the first 3 movies in the series.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	The show was a great remake of show white with many different changes that I didn't mine. The effects of the movie were astounding. A little bloody but it was great!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I bought this for my grandchildren but found it quite interesting myself. I especially liked the documentary containing information about the people behind the voices. Amazon's service was excellent.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	this series was amazing. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney provided a very realistic look into the founding of America. Highly reccomend.
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	It was fascinating---at first---to watch the Sookie Stackhouse books brought to life.  Her developing relationship with the vampire Bill was wonderfully compelling, and Eric's strength of character is flawless.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, an excessive amount of time is spent on unappealing secondary characters, and the main characters consistently get lost in a lot of tedious filler.<br /><br />  As well, the show's writers need to collaborate.  The inconsistencies that keep showing up have turned Sookie into a wishy-washy, unlikeable person who changes the facts to suit her mood.<br /><br />  *SPOILERS*  She's in love and makes love with Bill, then flirts and makes out with Sam in the next episode.  Wasn't she supposed to be uncomfortable kissing one man and then moving on to another?  As well, to work that scene into the show, Sookie states that Bill is more concerned with politics than with her---yet she knows his absence has nothing to do with politics.  Geez!  He's on trial for staking another vampire to save her life, and she's supposedly aware of that fact.<br /><br />  The writers need to read the blogs.  The show's audience has been objecting---even those who haven't read the books.<br /><br />  Charlaine Harris created a world sufficiently rich, well-paced, and filled with drama.  There's no need for lame side stories and inconsistencies that demean the main characters.  When you try to fix something that isn't broken, inevitably, it deteriorates until it does, in fact, get broken.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	As both a fan of the book and the movies I was very disappointed by the film. It did not do the book justice. Though OoTP was a long book more of the lighter, funnier and better story lines could of been included in the film without making it run too long. Many details were changed such as Sirus calling Harry James, Cho was the one who ratted out DA, Luna and Harry meeting in the woods to discuss Thestrals, Harry drawing his wand in front of Dudley's friends and so on. Professor Trewlany who is a delight has minimal screen time which was disappointing . But what was more disappointing was the fact Sirius was barely in the film and that Luna had barely any screen time. Besides the Weasly twins Luna made the book more interesting. By cutting down the Luna story line this made the film very tense. Im am non plussed at this point. I thought the first 2 films stayed very true to the book and had that pardon the pun the magic that makes a movie great. I loved the fact the third and forth films were darker but certain details were changed or omitted much like this the fifth film. The acting from Radcliffe was different as if he no longer had to try and the acting flowed from him which made him more natural in this film. I was a little disappointed in the casting of Luna Lovegood but then the actress had such little screen time the made her seem meek. I was also disappointed because we did not see as much of the trio as in the previous films. Hermoine and Ron are important to the plot and they had been in more scenes the film would of been better. I have never really cared for the new Dumbledore this actor makes Dumbledore seem tense,uncaring and harsh at times. It was a good film but if you loved the book as much as I did don't expect to love this movie as much as the book.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"This movie is well written and very well acted and I enjoyed it right up until the end (or ending). William Hurt, whom I often find disappointing, delivers a passionate, low key performance - perfect for the fantasy the director wants to weave. The cast is ernest and they sell the premise very well. I have to admit, I was caught up in the whole spooky creature thing. After ""Signs"" - a movie I liked - I was ready to believe anything. I guess when the secret was revealed, I felt cheated and began to think, how could that happen? I would have been happier with a NJ Devil like creature, rather than the way this movie ended. Unlike ""6Th Sense,"" if you know the ending of this movie, it's not going to be very entertaining.  Let's call it a nice little movie with some good acting and an ending with a twist."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	One of the most talented comedians ever.  Walter for President!  You'll laugh 'till you cry.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I wish everyone in every high school and college as well as our government leaders were forced to watch this and know how bad our food supply is and how many hands are in it.  This is absolutely terrible.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	Possibly one of the worst movies ever made, dare I put it right up there with WATERWORLD? I tried, I really tried but no matter what, I hated everything about this film. Everyone involved with this film, should be ashamed of themselves! It is time for Harrison Ford/Spielberg/Lucas and Co. to just stop and smell the Bengay. They are too old and this franchise ran it's course, as had STAR WARS. Move on or retire, please for the sake of all of us. And Shia Lebouf? Please, please, let Transformers 2 be good, 'cause this was not his most shining hour but he's young, he can move on, as long as he stays out of trouble. And Karen Allen? Not hard to see why she hasn't been working anymore. Too bad really but it's over. Couldn't wait to get this movie out of my house. Got it at the library, so wasted no money. I'm done and exhausted from disappointment.
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"It is nothing short of sad that Scott churned out such a normal hollywood version of Alien.<br />Everything is stock, predictable, making this movie actually boring at times.<br /><br />Yes, it looks great. But it does not look as good as the original, and given how the original looked in 79, this is one is downright lame.<br /><br />The reasons for why the first movie was good have been talked about for decades and it had allot to do with not doing the wrong things. all of which he does here.<br /><br />The aliens are now a dime a dozen, all different. Then you have one small alien somewho growing huge by staying in an ER room devoid of organic matter. There is not logic to the aliens, they are tiny, huge, snake like, octopus like, or microbes in slime. then the microbes become worms in the eye. Then a woman gets impregnated by the carier of the eye worms, with a different kind of alien. however, once that alien is removed she is healthy and has no eye worms. and so on.<br /><br />Worst of all, the human-aliens, who appear to be made out of wax, are seen running for their lives toward the familiar shaped pods full of aliens that are presumably their version of weapons of mass destruction. Not away from, but toward what they know to be death.<br /><br />Then you have many characters that have no function what so ever, like the Charlie Theron character, why was she there? Or weyland? He was so predictable, anybody saw that coming.<br /><br />What bothers me most is that lack of anything inovative. The aliens are much much more conventional und unsurprising than H.R.Gigers masterpiece. you will never better giger in this, so stick with it! The look of the ship was more bland und like ""ehh, spaceship"" than the old one.<br /><br />And the sexiness level was turned down. There is less new ground, less chances taken, here also with regards to the female cast. Who here will pretend he does not remember the scene in the first movie, where weaver puts on that space suit. This was more than 30 years ago. In this flick you got doctors who do not take of their undies, even while having mafor surgery.<br /><br />If this was NOT scott, and not alien, this would movie would be just another sci fi.<br /><br />However, there are no where near enough sci fi, and so I am glad they made it. Its better than nothing. But it also proves an old theory: good movie are LUCK, not the director. Exception may have been Lawrence's david lean.<br /><br />The movie is made watchable by Fassbender, the visiuals, and the references to Lawrence of arabia. My favorite movie of all time and one that shows how to do it right.<br /><br />Finally, there is bit of a scandal here in the news about how amazon scews its reviews systematically to push good ratings. and it is true that any rating that dislike a product or movie gets massive dings here. But I loved Alien, and this is movie is almost lazy in its attempt to cash in on that. Though, obviously, we have had allot worse with Indiana Jones, Tron, and the Horror that are the newer star wars flicks."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	My hubby & I became instant fans of Jeff Dunham after seeing his comedy special on tv.  After seeing both DVDs, this one is the best by far.  We've already watched it 3 times in one week & each time we're dying with laughter.  This is the perfect pick-me-up no matter what mood you're in!
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	Did enjoy this movie. Purchased it for my son's Christmas gift. I know he will enjoy it as much as we all did watching it at Grammies. :o)
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Enjoy the humor and admire the talent.  Jeff Dunham is a great entertainer.  We have all three dvd's and enjoy them immensely.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Brutal film that absolutely works and with no fairytale ending it's the reason why this exceptional film has and continues to be praised.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	If you like Harry Potter movies, then this one is as good as the others.  I bought it to add to my collection that includes all the previous movies, and was not disappointed.  It continues the same characters and themes as previous movies and adds some new elements and characters as well.
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	This is among the worst mass market trash films ever.  Full of no script and zero performances.  It should even be watched by children as there is so much suggestive content in each scene that it's amazing that it did not get an R-Rating, Next to this, Transformers seems like fine art.<br /><br />Don't get fooled by the hype, avoid this trash. Oh yeah, Harry Potter fans have no life.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Arrived very quickly and the disk looked like it was brand new! Plays great, my son loves it. Thanks so much!!!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Read this review only if you can't wait until you get your copy to find out what the plot is all about.<br /><br />The police are looking for a rat within their ranks.  Their rat is Matt Damon's character.  Matt is working for the mob, led by Jack Nicholson's character.  The mob is also looking for a rat within the mob.  Their rat is Leonardo DiCaprio's character. Leonardo is a deep, under-cover police detective who is supposed to find out about a stolen supply of computer micro-processors.  Leonardo finds out that Jack Nicholson's character is, besides being a mob boss, an informant for the FBI.  This is important because later in the movie, Matt Damon shoots Jack because he knows that Jack is planning on giving up some of his mob people to the FBI.  Leonardo finds out that Matt Damon is the rat and tries to arrest him but instead Leonardo gets shot by a guy who is ""on the take"" for the mob.  Matt Damon thinks he's off the hook and can go back to his secret life as a police sergeant but then in the last scene Matt Damon is walking into his apartment.  Mark Wahlberg is waiting inside.  Mark walks toward Matt Damon with this matter-of-fact, taking-care-of-business look on his face, doesn't say a word, and shoots Matt Damon in the head.  Then Mark puts a ski mask over his head and casually walks out of the apartment.  He is wearing booties over his feet and gloves so he will not leave behind any forensic evidence. This last scene is worth the price of the movie all by itself.  At the very end, you look out the window of Matt Damon's fancy apartment and you see a rat casually walking by the window."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Phenomanal movie for kids & adults alike, they humor is adult mostly, but the animation keeps the kids very entertained.  Keep it up Disney-Pixar!
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	As I was saying, this is good, but not nearly as good as 'Spark of Insanity.' I love Jeff Dunham and have since I first saw him many, many moons ago. Walter, Peanut, and Jose never fail to entertain, but I wasn't so sure about the other characters on this one. Don't get me wrong, I will watch this DVD many, many times in the future I'm sure, but Spark of Insanity was so much better!
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	"I'm a former P90X junkie.  That program literally changed my life and got me into the best shape of my life, even at 40 years old.  However, this is not P90X.  That is not a criticism at all, just don't expect more of the same.<br /><br />This is all floor exercises using your body weight with lots of plyometric and isometic exercises, cardio and core exercise that will work you - hard.  The exercises come fast and furious with a good mix of cardio and strength building (e.g. squat type exercises and push-up type exercises).  But its primary focus is the CORE.  If you didn't know what that meant before Insanity, you will definitely understand it once you begin.<br /><br />It's broken into two four week segments with a ""recovery"" (I use that term loosely..) week in between.  The warm-up itself is a workout.  The first four weeks are two rounds of three sets of a series of exercises equaling about 40 minutes per session.  In the second four weeks you'll find some of the warm-up exercises were exercises from the actual program from the first four weeks.  And the program itself moves to three rounds of three different sets of exercises equaling about an hour.  You'll actually be begging to go back to the first four weeks. If you like crazy, you'll love it...<br /><br />Shaun T is a good motivator and provides good tips about proper form and techniques.  The music adds to the program as well; as each routine picks up intensity, the music is well designed to keep you going.<br /><br />It is tough on the body, though, so be forewarned.  If you aren't in some semblance of shape, you may want to rethink this one.  I pulled a neck muscle during the first week because I didn't breathe properly.  It will tax your joints, your knees, your feet, your back.  If you are injury prone, be extremely careful.  Modify if you need to or pass on it altogether.<br /><br />It requires serious focus.  Breathing is key.  Drink lots of water.  And move at your own pace. Even the participants in the DVD (including Shaun T) have to quit and take breaks.  It's that intense.<br /><br />The caveat is really only this: you may lose some of the ""glamour"" muscles.  This doesn't mean you will get less strong but there are no no exercises for the biceps or the lats (no pull-ups here).  However, the muscles you do have (especially the legs) will be stronger and more defined.  If you want to maintain weight, you will need to increase your food intake big time, especially as the program progresses.<br /><br />Your body will change and your core (including the abs) will be stronger than you ever thought possible and you will be in incredible shape, even if you only do the program at half the intensity.<br /><br />I give it a definite thumbs up but know what you want to get out of the program and understand what it is about before investing your time and money in it.<br /><br />UPDATE: The first time around I was surprised and frustrated with the loss of size (due to lack of adequate calorie intake) but a second round with more focus is producing positive results.  The body fat reduction happened from the top down.  I am seeing more definition in the shoulders and the chest and seeing muscles in and around the abs, especially the obliques.  Things just feel tighter all the way around.  The ""spare tire"" thing is not completely gone though I feel quite ok in a t-shirt that fits rather than a larger size to hide behind.  Results: maintained my body weight and dropped from 20 to 16% body fat which means I actually built muscle.<br /><br />Final reflections: Using the CORE (which is much more than just your abs) makes all the difference.  Keep it tight, no shortcuts and you'll feel your power increasing.  The true test of this is during the high knee run in the warm-up and in the high jumps on the cardio power and resistance disc.

B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	For me, this was one of the darkest stories in the series. In it, Dunbledore dies and the death eaters take over Hogwarts. At the same time, we see Malfoy starting to change his mind about how 'cool' he thinks the death eaters are, and we see that he seems to be sorry about his part in this.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	The movie itself is just phenomenal. The Coen Brothers really are at the peak of their game with this film, a crazy soliloquy on life and those caught in the web of seemingly random violence and events where no one can possibly have any say on the outcome. Add to this pitch perfect performances by Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Kelly McDonald and Javier Bardem, who plays one of the scariest killers ever to grace the screen. There's a reason this film won the awards that it did and it shows in every frame.<br /><br />The DVD looks very nice and does justice to the cinematography by Roger Deakins, who was also nominated for this film. The colors are all replicated nicely and contrast is very high in nighttime scenes. The DD 5.1 surround is very effective, especially in scenes where gunfire is involved. I guess the only place that this DVD would be lacking is in the extras. You get three featurettes that are little more than fluff pieces and provide only a fleeting glimpse at the film's production. This is usually the case with Coen Bros. movies and it's kind of a disappointment but with the film being as good as it is and with it being presented in such high quality (as high as you can get on standard DVD anyway), I would strongly suggest picking this up.<br /><br />Also, this film rewards multiple viewings and it's worth watching again after watching the featurettes since they give a bit of insight to the film's title.

B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Iron Man was a huge surprise. And a very pleasant one at that. Going into the summer of 2008, my attention was completely preoccupied with The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk, Kung Fu Panda, Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, Indiana Jones 4, Wanted, Hellboy II, Wall-E, Step Brothers and The Mummy 3. All of which were very hyped up titles that had people lining up for them. But, among them was one of the best comic book movies ever made. As much as I love The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder (they're in my top three favorite all-time movies), I think that Iron Man is superior to both of them in some ways. It is highly entertaining all the way through. It doesn't matter if you like Superheroes, or not. There is something in this film for just about everyone. The few action scenes are top notch. My personal favorite is the scene when Iron Man returns to the Middle East to destroy all of his weapons. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr. was beyond perfect as Tony Stark. I am always glad to see A-listers give their all in these types of films because it proves that they are not just for children and geeks (honestly, we all still have a little of both in us). The rest of the amazing cast consists of Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrence Howard and even Samuel L. Jackson in a surprise post-credits cameo. I also have to mention the director, Jon Favreau. I only knew him from comedies and tv, but he did a great job with this big blockbuster.<br /><br />Despite the great action, direction , and superb casting, the real key to this movie's excellence is the script. The writing is not quite as deep and dark as The Dark Knight, but for a supposedly ""summer popcorn action flick"", it is right on par. It never hurts to get a team of actual comic book writers along with the creator himself, Stan The Man, to guide you and tell you what fits, and what doesn't. That is the only way to make a comic book character come to life, just as he is on the pages. And in the end it will always pay off with the most important group in the audience, the fans. I cannot say that without admitting something though. I was never an avid reader of the Iron Man comics, although he does make an appearance in alot of my books. But I am very familiar with the character, not only from my comics that he is in, but also the cartoon from the 90's. I still try to catch episodes of the cartoon to this day. The reason I never got into his comic arc is because, I honestly had no interest in the villains he fought, except for the Hulk. Most of his villains were just big robots and monsters (Godzilla was actually one of them). With that said, I was still happy to see that they chose a very conventional first villain, Iron Monger. As long as they never make a movie with M.O.D.O.K., I will be happy.<br /><br />My only complaint about this movie is how scarce the action is. There are only really three scenes of action in total. I know it may seem a little hypocritical for me to complain about the action in Iron Man and give it a 90%, when I gave The Dark Knight 100%, and it had even less action than Iron Man. But the difference between the two is that Iron Man is an action movie, but in my opinion, The Dark Knight is a drama. Alot of people would probably disagree with that statement, but after watching both films many many times, that's the feeling I get about them. The action scenes that it does have are beautiful though. I just think Jon Favreau is not an action director, so he played it safe. In the end, that may have been why Iron Man was so great. I was just really surprised that Iron Man became one of my favorite movies. It reminds me of how I felt about Star Trek. I had my doubts, but those doubts were completely shattered after seeing it.<br /><br />I'll keep this very short because I cannot pretend to be a pro. As far as I can tell, the Picture Quality is reference material through and through. Grain is persistent thoughout, but that only means that they didn't scrub this beautiful transfer clean (which would have taken details away along with the grain). The beautiful effects by ILM are on full display, and i saw no obvious flaws. The same can be said for the audio too. I'm working with a very modest Home Theatre, but I can tell the difference between a good and poor soundtrack. I couldn't hear any apparent flaws. Fine work. As far as the Special Features fo, I loved them. Plain and simple. I just wish there was a damn audio commentary. Commentaries are essential to me, and I cannot help but dock the extras a whole point for there not being one. The one that Favreau did for Iron Man 2 was exactly what we want in a commentary, so it was a missed opportunity. Otherwise, the extras were brilliant.<br /><br />8.5/10"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Pixar has struck gold one again with this teriffic movie that's sure to become a classic.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson) is the hottest rookie car on the Piston Cup Circuit, but he's facing a challenge from two other cars: The King (Richard Petty) and Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  All three cars are tied going into the final race of the season.  By the end of the race, McQueen has a huge lead over Hicks and The King, but he made a decision not to change tires earlier in the race.  Now, he suffers a blowout, allowing Hicks and The King to catch up.  The race ends in a three-way tie.  It is decided that there will be one winner-take-all race at the Los Angeles International Speedway the following week.  The three cars set off on their cross-country journey.<br /><br />Lightning is riding happily along in the back of his trailer when suddenly, something goes wrong.  Lightning finds himself out of his trailer and in the middle of a crowded interstate.  Meanwhile, his tractor/trailer keeps driving, not realizing Lightning is missing.  Lightning ends up in the sleepy town of Radiator Springs, on Route 66.<br /><br />Lightning's problems begin as soon as he enters town.  He ends up destroying the town's main road, is arrested by the sheriff, and impounded and booted in the town's impound lot.  In the lot, he meets Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), an old tow truck.  Then, he's taken to the courthouse, where Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences lightning to fix the road before he'll be allowed to go on to his race in California.  There are other interesting cars in Radiator Springs, including Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a hot-looking Porsche who runs the town hotel, Sarge the army jeep, and Flo, owner of Flo's V8 Cafe.  Radiator Falls used to be a bustling town, but since the interstate was built, very few travellers drive through.<br /><br />Lightning begins his job of re-paving the road and he finishes rather quickly, but Doc is unsatisfied with his work, so he tells Lightning to start over.  Frustrated, Lightning begins again.  However, something unexpected has been happening.  Lightning finds himself developing friendships with each car in Radiator Springs, especially Sally. Mater has taken a special liking to Lightning, even taking him tractor tipping. Mater calls Lightning his best friend. He also finds out that Doc is hiding a secret of his own from everyone in town.  Soon, the road is finished, and Lightning is free to go to his race in California.  But he's having second thoughts.  Sally took him for a drive, and Lightning was impressed with the beautiful scenery.  Sally also tells him about how Radiator Springs used to be a hub of activity and how she wishes it would be that way again.  Lightning even gets some new tires and a new paint job.  He doesn't look like the race car he was before.<br /><br />Just as it looks like Lightning has made up his mind to stay in Radiator Springs, the town is besieged by other cars and helicopters, along with Lightning's own truck.  They scoop him up and wisk him off to the race in California, leaving his friends in Radiator Springs surprised and Lightning sad.  Once at the track, Lightning, Hicks, and The King start their race.  The only member in Lightning's pit is his faithful truck, until he hears the voice of Doc Hudson.  All of his friends from Radiator Springs have come to help him.<br /><br />As for the race, Lightning has been trailing The King and Hicks the entire way.  As the race enters its final laps, Hicks slams into The King, causing him to crash on the infield.  Lightning, only inches from the finish line and the Piston Cup Championship, makes a decision that changes his life.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Pixar Studios has turned out some fine animated movies in recent years, but this is one of the best.  The story is both exciting and heartwarming, and its fun to watch Lightning learn that there's more to life than winning races and getting big sponsorships.  Friendship and trust are just as important.  Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Michael Keaton, and Richard Petty bring the animated cars to life in a style that is funny, and you'll find yourself cheering for each one.  Jay Leno, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Dale Waltrip, Mario Andretti, and Bob Costas lend their talents to the collection of cars, too.<br /><br />I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Children and adults will enjoy this revved-up and exciting movie.  Ka Chow!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	For the Harry Potter fandom the wait for a new movie has been quite rewarding. Deathly Hallows Part I, has very successfully built up the suspense and the curiosity of the myriad of Potter fans, who will now wait restlessly for the final climax of the series. Followers of Harry Potter and his two friends, who have grown up simultaneously with the fictional trio, would have found the confusions, frustrations and rage of the stormy teenage years very familiar. The plot deals with a lot of real emotions, the emotions and aches of growing up, of being challenged. There is jealousy, anger and empathy--these human emotions mark a departure of Deathly from the bravado and mindless adventures of the earlier Potter flicks.<br /><br />Harry, Ron and Hermione escape from the numerous attacks of the Death Eaters, let loose by Voldemort. The killing mission includes a high adrenalin chase of Harry and his seven look-alikes by the blood thirsty gang, which is a high point of the movie, visually. Potter and friends escape into the wilderness, but the Death Eaters' attacks never come to an end, and their goons capture and take them to the lair.<br /><br />The trio escapes from the dungeon with the help of elf Dobby who pays with his life in the effort to release them. Dobby's death in the lap of Harry Potter brings about the most poignant scene in the movie. Now Harry and friends come to learn about the Deathly Hallows, based on some symbols and their intuitions. Hermione's reading of the story about the seven deathly hallows is accompanied by a symbolic enactment, which is very captivating and will remain deeply etched in the viewer's mind for long.<br /><br />While the development of the plot is very intelligent and flawless, there are certain issues about the pace of the movie. Some parts drag, especially the lengthy discussions and deliberations. The many ifs and buts during the unfolding of the plot frustrate the viewer, used to the fast pace of the childhood adventure and games of the earlier movies. Most of the action takes place in the outside world, away from the all too familiar school premises. That's a welcome change.<br /><br />Finally the fights and misunderstandings between Harry and Ron depict the coming of age of the chums.<br /><br />The die-hard fans will surely revel in the movie despite the fact the director David Yates has taken a lot of liberty about his selection of which part of the book to include in the movie and which to leave out.  For the uninitiated, though, this random and non-linear selection may appear quite disjointed and confusing.<br /><br />Chinmay Hota<br />Author of 'Hits and Misses'
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	When was the last time you were on the edge of your seat, actually felling your toes curl and wondering what was going to happen next?  Probably when you watched the first ten minutes of SCREAM - right?  Now take that feeling and stretch it out for almost two hours - what a rush!<br /><br />Do you want to know why NCFOM is such a nail-biter and has you listening for that pin to drop?  Simple - it's because there is NO SOUNDTRACK to this movie!  That's right... no music to let you know what's coming.  No music to set the tone or stage for what you are about to receive.  It scares the ravioli out of you!<br /><br />NCFOM is shot entire without the use of any musical score or background-setting sounds.  What you hear is exactly what the character or the setting in the movie hears, nothing more, nothing less.  That is quite a powerful tool for getting you to feel what is happening.<br /><br />I won't go into the entire plot of the film, as virtually every review prior to this one has already done so, but suffice it to say that you have the opportunity to witness one of the greatest villains ever to grace the screen.  See the movie if for no other reason than to watch an ultimate bad guy scare the stuffing out of you!<br /><br />The acting in the movie, top-to-bottom was magnificent.  The editing was magnificent, never letting you see more than you should or less than you need.  The ending was perfect!  Story done- end the movie - nothing more to say - go home and sweet dreams!<br /><br />Do you REALLY want to see what a GREAT movie looks and sounds like?  Watch this one!

After watching it I decided I needed to own a copy for my own collection and the Amazon holiday price just couldn't be beat!  This is a fast paced, well acted (the actors accents are great!) show with an engaging plot line that's both interesting and ""current"" since vampires seem to be all the rage these days.  I haven't read all the books, but in this case I don't think I mind the deviation from Ms. Harris' original telling as the show is that good!  Watching the second season now with a plan in place to buy the third season as soon as it drops!"

B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"I am a HUGE fan of Michael Pollan's ""The Omnivore's Dilemna"" and thus am delighted at this new documentary. Apart from pretty much bringing to life the first 2/3 of that book, the film also presents more information concerning the battle against industrial food companies. It pushed further into the symbiotic relationship between the government and these food companies, and the legal confrontation from the people.<br /><br />Thankfully, this was NOT an anti-meat documentary, as it devoted a lot of time to critique the corn and soybean industries, especially the Monsanto monopoly. The film provided several tips on how to become more knowledgable about your food, how to buy and eat healthier, and what kind of laws are needed for the food industry to improve (research: Kevin's Law). It showed you the problems that you should know about (CAFOs and other industrial animal plants), the problems that you probably don't know about (veggie libel laws, the Monsanto soybean monopoly), and the present alternatives (Polyface Farms). It covers an amazing range of issues, and would only be better if filmmakers were able to get the corporations on camera. Unexpectedly, companies like Purdue, Tyson, Smithfield, and Monsanto were not compliant.<br /><br />The most important message is know where your food comes from. Only by being informative can you decide for yourself what you want to eat."
B001684L0A	4.0	b	HBO's attempt to be the liberal, secular media outlet they are certainly made sure this movie didn't have near the flavor of the book itself.  Nonetheless, the movie was good, but it made me wonder how far from real life the movie was.<br /><br />The book by McCullough referenced continuously how deep the Christian faith of the Adams were, as were nearly all of the Founding Fathers.  Christianity was the basis of the formation of America's independence.  For those who doubt that, just read the Constitution as well as the Declaration of Independence.<br /><br />The other disappointment was that Amazon's clip of McCullough has David saying how the movie characters actually talk the way they did in Adams' time.  The quotes in his book show that the Adams wrote with far more elegance and flair than the characters in the movie used.  There was no resemblance whatsoever.<br /><br />Those two items made me wonder how accurate the movie truly was.

B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I've come to really like Pixar productions.  Good movies, good story lines and just enough underlying adult humor to keep the parents engaged.  This story is cute, one that I'm sure will be a hit with the little ones.  Great animation, big star voices and a good story line that offers some life lessons.  One to add to the library.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"It's very scary to know about some of the results the government don't want you to know about genetically modified foods... mold in the blood caused by seedless grapes & watermelon.  There is a microscope that magnifies the blood 16,000x its size.  Of course the general health industry doesn't use it nor will the government allow them to have it because of what you may find in your blood stream caused by eating GMF.<br /><br />There's been a couple of test done using McDonald's meat & french fries.  You know that food when left out will usually mold and rot.  Apparently somebody kept a McDonald's quarter pounder and french fries for over 3 years in a metal lunch box.  The results... the fries look the same as it did when it left the fryer and the hamburger didn't change at all.  The meat may have shrunk just a little and the bread became slightly brittle and crumbled when handled.  ""What is McDonald feeding our children?"" asked the producer of that film.  I can't prove if what she says is true or not, however I left some fries in my car for several months and the fries never molded.  It was still greasy and salty but not a speck of mold on it.  You can view this by going to [...] and search under McDonald.<br /><br />I personally will not eat meat anymore after watching Food Inc.  I was slowly moving in this direction anyway, however after viewing Food Inc. it made the process much easier.  Should I ever fall off the wagon, I will only eat cattle fed on grains or classified as organic. I will only buy locally grown foods or grow my own and buy organic if at all possible.  I will pay extra to ensure I know what is going into my body.<br /><br />If you believe our government has our best interest, think again.  They've poisoned our water, shove chemicals into our bodies by promoting drugs (treat the symptoms, not find the cure), force vaccines onto our children which I truly believe is the route to all our major illnesses today, allow chemicals into our food, knowing it's harmful effects, and made sure they will not be held responsible by passing laws in their favor. Big corporation, UGH!!!!!!<br /><br />If you don't watch out for your children or yourself, who will?  Certainly not our government."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I feel guilty for loving this film, but there you have it. ""Sin City"" is ""Pulp Fiction"" with even less redeeming moral value. If you're easily offended (pretty much by anything), stay far away. Otherwise, sit back and revel in this movie's noir-soaked atmosphere.<br /><br />I've not read the Frank Miller graphic novels upon which this film is based, but I've seen the illustrations, and I have to say that ""Sin City"" triumphs in bringing the look of the comics to the screen. I'm not usually a fan of style over substance (I seem to be one of the few that thought last year's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" a dismal failure), but I could have watched Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's stunning monochrome compositions all day. Not since Dorothy opened the door of her house on to a Technicolor Munchkinland has black and white cinematography been juxtaposed to color more effectively. The CGI effects are flawless, and a terrific and audacious pulpy score pulses throughout the entire film.<br /><br />Three equally bizarre stories are interlinked, again a la ""Pulp Fiction,"" and brought to life by a cast of not-quite-above the title stars: Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood (creepy as hell!), Michael Clark Duncan. The only box office actor is Bruce Willis, who plays a role that fits him like a glove, that of the melancholy hero past his prime who wants to prove he's got one more knockout punch in him before he's KO'd for good.<br /><br />The only reason this film rises above cheap titillation is that everyone involved with it commits 100% to a common vision of what the film should be. There's something admirable about the way the filmmakers refuse to compromise their (admittedly) disgusting visions to appease the moral conservatives, or to get a lesser rating, or to make more money at the box office. ""Sin City"" is a movie for adults that appeals to the thirteen-year-old in all of us, and what fun it is.<br /><br />Grade: A"

I urge you to watch this before you watch the Hulk.  They play on each other.  I wonder whats coming next.

B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	I went to see this movie in the movie theater with my girlfriend. (I had no interest in the movie, but you know how that goes.) I've never before wasted my money on such a terrible movie. The acting was terrible, and the transition of the movie was even worse. My girlfriend agreed with me, worst movie we've ever seen at the theater. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	"Snow White and the Huntsman is one of those films that leaves you wondering how they managed to get so much brilliantly right, coming so close to being a classic, and yet fall short because of baffling flaws that threaten to sink it like a lead weight.<br /><br />On the brilliant side, you start with the highly ambitious script by Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. They flesh out the story of Snow White by not only drawing on the variant versions of the original fairy tale for extra detail but also by adding in background elements to give depth and reality to the world in which it takes place, where reality and magic are inextricably linked and the rise and fall of innocence affect the very land itself. Thus this Snow White is both magical and epic in scale and consequence, far above the simple tale related by the Brothers Grimm.  The characters are themselves equally fleshed out, most particularly the evil queen, who sets a new standard by which all other fairy tale evil queens will hence be measured.  For the first time, the evil queen - Ravenna by name in this case - actually comes with a back story, not only for how she actually became queen but also for why she came to be evil in the first place. You may not sympathize with her, but her behavior becomes much more understandable when you see how she came to where she is at the time of the story. Also brought into greater depth are the Huntsman and the Prince (in this case a duke's son) and the roles they play in Snow White's ultimate fate.<br /><br />And most brilliant of all is Charlize Theron's portrayal of Ravenna. She transforms herself on the screen like the chameleon Ravenna is, going from seeming helpless captive to enchanting beauty to imperious queen, only letting her cold ruthlessness and deadly intensity show through when it suits her purpose. Theron does with a glance or a turn of the head, or even just the way she walks across a room, what lesser actors would take lines of dialogue to convey.<br /><br />Another big plus is the cinematography and the art design, making the settings both realistic and yet fitting backdrops for a fairy tale at the same time. The way the enchanted forest is done here stands as superior to any that I've seen in any other film, truly magical and full of wonder. And then there's their truly original take on the Magic Mirror, an enormous polished-metal disc of the kind actually used back in ancient and early medieval times instead of the silver-backed glass we're familiar with. And the unique way it came to life to answer the Queen's questions was quite well done and add much to the eerie atmosphere that always seemed to surround Theron's Ravenna. A very nice touch indeed. As was the dark and ominous crown Ravenna ends up wearing when she is queen, the design perfectly suited to project a combination of power and ruthless resolve.<br /><br />Of all the things weighing the film down however, Kristen Stewart's Snow White unfortunately tops the list. Part of this - the way the character was written - is admittedly not her fault. The acting however - or rather the lack thereof - is. Stewart's performance belongs to the Keannu Reeves' one-facial-expression-for-the-entire-film school of acting. Worse still, it's the same facial expression she used through the entire Twilight series, as if she wandered off the set for those films and onto the set for this one, stopping only for a costume change. And her limitations become more pronounced as the script demands greater and less plausible things of the character, most particularly Snow White as a fairy tale Joan Of Arc.  This was one of the really hard to swallow even for a fairy tale moments: a princess, who's spent most of her childhood locked away in a tower, is suddenly donning armor and leading a rebel army into battle with sword and shield (but strangely without a helmet) like a war-hardened veteran?<br /><br />Another big problem is in the script itself.  While I appreciate the ambitiousness that really added to the early part of the movie, it becomes clear as the film progresses that a number of things were not really thought through and other things were simply bad ideas. I've already mentioned the strange way in which Snow White inexplicably suddenly morphs - not remotely convincingly - into Snow White: Warrior Princess. The seven dwarves, who were key to the original fairy tale, have been reduced to near irrelevance here. You could in fact cut pretty much all of their scenes and it wouldn't affect the basic plot one bit. While the CGI-enhanced actors do a decent job of bringing the dwarves to life, the problem remains that they really have little to do and end up making parts of the movie drag. Another bad idea comes in the form of the ""Curse of Twilight"", i.e. the female hero must have two male counterparts as potential love interests, regardless of how little sense it makes or how awkwardly its handled. The idea to flesh out the Huntsman and the Prince was good, but then taking that and giving them the Twilight treatment really hobbled the movie, particularly as it was not remotely believable. Worse, it was baffling in that it not only messed with the whole fairy tale feel of the story, it led absolutely nowhere and was left like a jarringly unresolved plot thread at the end leaving you wondering what the writers had been thinking. As other reviewers have mentioned, they'd have been far better off going with just combining the characters into one. Add in the fact that Kristen Stewart's one-note Snow White had absolutely no chemistry with either Chris Hemsworth's Hunter or Sam Claflin's Prince William and it just really sucked the air out of a good third of the movie, to the point where you just want Charlize Theron's Ravenna to come back and get things moving once again.<br /><br />Another problem was Bob Hoskins' head dwarf, Muir.  Hoskins, an actor whose work is generally always excellent, is strangely out of sorts here as his eyes never seemed to focus on anyone or anything. I later learned that apparently Muir is supposed to be blind, but the way it was handled in the film this was never made clear. Assuming this to be true however, then this was one of the worst portrayals of a blind person I've ever seen as nothing else about the way he acted or held his head or moved about rang true to the way real blind people I've known do those things.  It was instead simply baffling as Hoskins went through the movie with this inexplicably vacant and unsettling stare. The only possible excuse I can think of is that this was perhaps due to the way that the CGI-dwarfing of his character was handled which may have resulted in the more physical parts of Hoskins' performance being 'lost in translation' as it were.<br /><br />A more niggling problem, for me anyway, was the fact that the Huntsman was always armed with - and only with - a double-bladed war ax and a set of throwing axes.  I'm sorry, but even fairy tale huntsmen don't go hunting with axes.  They use bows, knives and traps. One supposes that they didn't let Hemsworth's Huntsman use a bow because Claflin's Prince was already using a bow, but that also doesn't make sense because the nobility didn't go to war with bows.<br /><br />All of that said though, I still feel Snow White and the Huntsman is worth seeing for the good things it brings to the genre and for Charlize Theron's stand-out performance as Ravenna. Recommended for any fan of retellings of classic fairy tales, of Charlize Theron and for students of why near-great films sometimes end up being pulled down by their flaws."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"""John Adams"" is simply one of the best historical miniseries that I have ever seen.  It will help people learn much more about John Adams contributions to the American Revolution and our independence.  It also does an excellent job of showing the debate over independence and the quarrels and rivalries of that time period.  I have used episode 2 in my U.S. history classroom to show my students the debate of independence and how those favoring independence ultimately won the day.  I wish that a similar miniseries would be produced over George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, and perhaps over the American Revolution in general. (I have always felt that the Revolution has not received the attention from Hollywood that it truly deserves, especially compared to the number of movies and miniseries that have been made about the Civil War.)"
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	The Departed is another future classic movie directed by Martin Scorsese.<br />The all star cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Billy Costigan (a rookie cop). In addition, Jack Nicholson plays (mob boss Frank Costello). Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen play investigative detectives. Matt Damon does a good job of playing Collin Sullivan, who is an SUI officer.<br />This movie is full of backstabbing and complex plots that are a little difficult to follow. There is action from the opening until the closing of the movie. I had to take one star away from my final rating because this movie is a little too long. It runs about 151 minutes which is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Be prepared to pause your DVD player and take a short break. However, the actors are all believable and very talented.<br />The ending is surprising which is good.<br />I rate this movie with 4 stars.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This comedy routine was also funny my husband and I both enjoy jeff dunham,s work.
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	"Distilling a long and complex book into a two hour movie is<br />difficult at best and impossible at worst, yet I can't help but think ""Order of the Phoenix"" could have been better. With apologies to everyone who thought it was wonderful, I found it disappointing, disjointed and confusing.  The rapidity with which the action developed and new characters appeared with little or no exposition was unsettling. My husband, a slight HP fan who enjoyed the previous movies, remarked on the way home he'd understood very little of the plot. When I explained the relationships between some of the characters and provided a little basckground, he asked irately, ""And I was supposed to know this how?"" Exactly. Even I, devoted HP reader and movie watcher, had the sense that ""Order of the Phoenix"" was 128 minutes of previews for the REAL movie--which I'd love to see! Perhaps an unedited version will show up (on ten discs)...<br />I'm giving it three stars instead of one, because of the stunning acting--especially Alan Rickman and Imelda Staunton--and the amazing sets.  It's unfortunate that both got such short shrift.<br />And by the way, kudos to J.K. Rowling for not writing with an eye to the movies."
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	This movie I vote to be the worse in the series that I have seen.  I watched the movie and felt as though I had not even watched a movie.  It dragged on too long.  Reading the book was far more entertaining.<br /><br />People you can watch it, if you dare, but beware it is boring.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"Others have bemoaned the absence of some of the interesting parts of the book, but I felt that it was adequate as a condensed version. Trying to put everything in would make a much longer film than most folks would be comfortable sitting through. In this review, I would like to comment on the merits of releasing it in HiDef. I viewed the standard version on the same HDTV (46"" LCD 1920x1080 resolution) with two different makes of upconverting DVD player and both produced a very watchable picture. However, the Dursley's wallpaper pattern seemed to bleed over and at times it was hard to tell which side of the fence Harry was on in the playground. Watching the same scenes on the HD DVD, I was amazed at how much brighter and sharper everything was. The wallpaper no longer dominated the scene and things like the Dementors had clear features. I half expected to discover that the diference might not be worth the extra cost for the equipment and media, but there is a remarkable improvement in picture and sound quality. Perhaps, in the future, the filmmakers might produce a greatly extended version for release on HD DVD. No one would have to watch it all in one go."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Iron Man is one of those all too rare big budget movies that actually delivers.  Downey was born to play Tony Stark but the real hero of this movie is the screenplay.  A well written story, great charactors and terrific special effects, put Iron Man on top of the Super heap!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	my son loves this movie and was real excited about cruising lighting and fire tow-mater cars that came with it.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	I have to give this movie five stars It is mezmerizing. I used to read a lot of comic book and graphic novels and even though I never read the Sin City novels I still read some of the dark black and white Manga. This whole movie looks and feels like a dark gothic comic book. I give it one star for the great story line another star for it`s cast, another star for the way it`s is filmed (black and white with accents of color )very cool, another star dark for the and creepy musical score and the 5th star well....I think I will just give that to Nancy .God bless you little girl.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Before we even opened the DVD, friends were begging to borrow it.  So we passed it on.  We saw it in the theater so we didn't mind waiting, but it's been 2 weeks and we're ready to have it back.  We loved the movie!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	If Pixar can pull off an excellent movie about talking cars, they can do anything.<br /><br />When I first heard about Cars, I was a bit underwhelmed.  Talking cars?  Well, Pixar had hit gold with talking fish but...cars?  I personally had doubts about this movie, but when I came out of watching it, I was very satisfied and pleasantly suprised.<br /><br />Much like Pixar's previous films, Cars is a story diven film.  And with only three real action scenes in the entire film (two at the beginning, one at the end), it depends on it's story to stay afloat and keep the audience interested.  And i'm happy to say that the film kept my interest the entire way through.<br /><br />Cars follows a hot and fast upcoming racer named Lightning McQueen, a racecar who will stop at nothing to get to the top and become the champion.  However, on his way to a tie-breaker race, he becomes lost in a little route 66 town that's fallen off the map.  Here, high and mighty ego clashes with small town slowness and McQueen undergos a personal journey to find himself and what really matters in his life.<br /><br />When trying to think of negatives for this movie...I can't think of any. There really is nothing wrong with Cars. There are no weak points that immediatly come to mind. It pulls your emotions in the right directions at the right time and for the right amount of time.  I laughed, chuckled and applauded at all the right moments (especially the farting tractors).  So did everyone else in the theater.  Even side charachters, some of whom have only a few lines, are strong and well played.  I'd say that there are no weak charachters in Cars, something that is all too rare these days.  Even those who don't really contribute to the plot (the surplus military jeep for example) are fun to watch.  This is a great film that anyone can watch and enjoy, though action fans might find themselves a bit bored during most of the movie.  It has a great message (sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself), morals about what's really important in life, and what's worth winning, and so much more.  Heck, even a malfunctioning stoplight is enjoyable to watch.  Everyone in the theater that I attended had a blast and enjoyed watching the movie.<br /><br />Cars is easily one of the best films of the year, the kind that you can't stop raving about, and is almost certianly going to be the main contender for best animated feature. This is annother winner for Pixar, and is a great film that everyone should watch at least once.<br /><br />Oh, and be sure to stay for the credits. Trust me on this one.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	Unfortunately, they now have to take more shortcuts with the movies.  The 1st 3 movies were very close to the books but now the series is getting much to complicated for the cinema to depict properly.  They did a very good job with the movie but once again the book is better.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I'm into month 2 of Insanity and I'm telling you--there is no WAY you will not lose weight unless you are not working out/eating poorly.  LOVE Shaun T--never heard of him before this but he's very motivational, funny but TOUGH.  Not one to discourage anyone but if you're a beginner or frankly a ""whiner"" or a ""quitter""--this is NOT for you--start on a much smaller scale and maybe build up to this."
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	luckily Ms Theron planted the anchor for an other wise mis-cast, weakly written version of this timeless classic. A heavy reliance upon CGI and DI was most likely pitched to compensate for weaknesses in story. What's most unfortunate is that because of the convenience of visual animation and the economy of filmless production, we're left with lazy filmaking. Regardless of the negatives, the perspective is fresh in trying to keep with traditional versions and I'll still keep it in my library along with the other variations. If it's any consolation, it was well shot, visually pleasing and the effects were pleasant. I killed a bowl of ramen noodlez and a PB&J sandwich, so it wasn't a total loss. A formulaic guilty pleasure indeed.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	The local paper/magazine reviews for this show weren't great, so I wasn't expecting a lot, but I got hooked in the first 10 minutes.  Very enjoyable show, well written and acted. I was impressed with the way they brought the story full-circle and ended the first season in a satisfying way, yet left a number of open storylines for the next season (I think that's got to be a lot harder to do than it sounds).  Yes, there is a lot of sex and nudity and a certain amount of violence, but that's to be expected on HBO. I went back and watched some of the episodes from the On Demand feature more than once.  I plan to get the DVD when it comes out.  One of the (IMO misguided) reviewers said the only thing he liked about the show was the title sequence, which I agree is great, but give the show a chance even if you're not sure, or you don't like vampires, or whatever.  It just may grow on you.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	The movie starts off well, but clearly begins to lag as Kristen Stewart becomes the focal point.  The scenes with Charlize as the Queen are the most intriguing part of the movie and she clearly steals the film.  In the middle where she is absent for large gaps, the movie drags.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"I saw this movie in the theater and was both horrified and impressed!  I was horrified at all the ""food politics,"" and impressed that they could get so many people to talk about what's going on.  I learned a lot, and I felt this was an important enough issue to purchase the movie so that I could share it with others.  I particularly like the fact that they didn't alienate meat-eaters--the corruption carries over to corn, soy beans, you name it.  The basic message is this:  Know where your food comes from!  And I like the fact that, just when you are at the point of despair, at the end of the movie they give you suggestions about things you can do on the positive side!"
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	After much hassle, I at long last go to see SIN CITY, the movie version of the classic Frank Miller graphic novels. I sit through 20 minutes of previews, including one for HITCHIKER'S GUIDE<br /><br />which I'm excited about (I dig Doug Adams), and the tedious STAR WARS 3 : SITH HAPPENS, which revolted me to no end.<br /><br />The movie begins. (WARNING: I don't give much away in this review, but at this point I do give away small clips).<br /><br />Love the opening. Great mini which sets up the feel of the city and hence, the feel of the movie.<br /><br />Love the tragic Bruce Willis short. Glad to see Nick Stahls working.<br /><br />Then, we get right to the good stuff: MARV.<br /><br />The Marv segment steals the show for me, hands down. I love anti-hero stories, I love intense violence and gore, I love insane cannibal stories and I love Mickey Rourke (good to see him in a bigger role again). This segment had it all and then some! Whoever thought Elijah Wood could be scary? Better yet, who ever thought there would be a flick where Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood brawl!?! Marv is a superb anti-hero: he's mean but to the right people, he has self-loathing and a disorder, he reflects on the old days when he kicked everyone's assess, one of his only pals is a lesbian, and he goes nuts when anyone roughs up a woman.<br /><br />But although he easily takes the cake here, let's not overlook the other goodies.<br /><br />The next act, featuring the incredible Benico Del Toro, Brittany Murphy and some bloke named Clive who I've only elsewhere seen in I'LL SLEEP WHEN I'M DEAD (which sucked while I watched), was good but I didn't care for Clive. He was too bland for me. Too David Duchoviny. Other than that, it was smokin'. Benico shined bright as always.<br /><br />Bruce Willis returns in a wonderful grand finale. I was particularly fond of Nick from IN THE BEDROOM as Junior/Yellow Bastard. What a sickeningly good show he put on. He looked like what would happen if John Malcovitch and Big Bird had a child together and then locked it in a fruit cellar for thirty years.<br /><br />The stylish noir of the film is genius, the stark B&W with the touches of burning color. It's hypnotic and gorgeous.  Rodriguez redems himself for the hilariously bad ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO. The hard-ass saving the dirty angel theme runs throughout the film but doesn't get old<br /><br />or stale, the violence is over the top and splendidly brutal, and the gore and T&A is aplenty, pleasing the heck out of a depraved maniac like me.<br /><br />This film gets stars all across the board from me. Although the casting of that  bland bloke Clive in the hooker showdown tale was a bad move, and although Bruce Willis plays an old man and yet nobody thinks to slap some old man make-up on him (even when he ages during the course of the film), the movie over-all is stunningly good and Miller's brillance was wonderfuly transported from the page to the screen.<br /><br />The real stroke of genius here was letting Frank Miller co-direct the movie. Rodriguez (and Tarantino, somewhere) aided with the techincal and camera direction aspect  but Miller repainted the mood of his graphic novels. This is why it came out so  good, unlike the bastardized versions of comics which hit theaters without consultation<br /><br />of the original creators (doody-tanks like THE PUNISHER and THE HULK). Rami did great on the SPIDER-MAN films because he was such a hardcore fanboy, but normally such dedication to the original artisty isn't present and directors think they have ways to improve the original story, and then they, in the end, ruin them.<br /><br />BATMAN BEGINS was originaly based on Frank Miller's BATMAN: YEAR ONE. While BATMAN BEGINS still looks to have some promise, it likely would have been better if they had worked with Miller on it. Miller was one of the best things to ever happen to Batman. We'll see if Christian Bale cuts the mustard or if he simply cuts the cheese.<br /><br />So far, I have mixed feelings about it. It looks good overall, but Bale looks so much like Kilmer in the suit. This seems like a bad omen. Don't get me wrong, I like Bale. AMERICAN PSYCHO was great! But<br /><br />Bale as Batman? I don't know about that.<br /><br />Anyway, SIN CITY was the best movie I've seen in a very, very long time. I highly, highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys crime, noir, horror and overall fun movies.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	Texas heat and a slew of shady characters ornament this movie. As main character Moss runs into mess of human and canine bodies and finds $2MM drug money during his hunting trip, we get to see the determination of the former Vietnam vet to turn the life of his family around once he has a full possesion of his money. As he tries to avoid drug dealers, former special operations soldiers and a serial killer he gets on to fight for his life as if he is back in the war fields.  We track him pacing between US and Mexican border, beaten, battered and wounded attempting with all his might to preserve the money he found in order to ensure a better life for himself and his wife.  Javier Bardem plays a killer who kills indiscriminately everyone on his path.  He needs no other reason to kill them but the fact that people see his face or loose the coin toss bet to dispose of them.  He fights by the principals that are stronger money, power or any other values we are used to.  He makes his own rules.  Ending is somewhat unexpected, but than again this is a Coen Brothers' movie and they have their own way of presenting reality to their audience.  I expected more from this movie.  Josh Brolin shines in his role of a vietnam veteran and so does Tommy Lee Jones in his role of the tired police sheriff.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"""Sin City"" is a comic book on a big screen.  Although played with real actors, the film definitely has a surreal edge where everything is larger than life.<br /><br />A synopsis of ""Sin City"" would probably be that all the violence, the plots and the characters cannot be believed at the end of the day.  Rather, the viewer is dwelling in the world of comics where heroes can take a terrible beating but still return for more and the characters are nastier, meaner and more unrelenting than could ever be the case in real life.<br /><br />I saw this film with my 18 year old son who believed it to be the most violent movie he had ever seen.  To an extent he was right although this ignores the fact that the characters were part of a modern world comic strip.  Once one adopts this mind set, the movie is more surreal than real.<br /><br />""Sin City"" has large ensemble cast and is filmed mainly in monochrome.  Yet for every black and white image, there is always one piece of colour.  It may be a woman's eyes, it may be her dress or it may be the skin colour of a baddie.  On this scale, ""Sin City"" is a technical marvel than envelopes the viewer.  There can be few films released in the past year that both captivate and repel the viewer at the same time."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is hilarious.  One tends to forget that he is conversing with a puppet and I catch myself time and again thinking of the puppets as a real person. Each one with its own very easily identifiable personality. I realy enjoy his shows and this particular video is as excellent as always.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"A vicious attack!<br /><br />An unfair accusation!<br /><br />These incidents are just the start of the challenges Harry must face in The Order of the Phoenix.  Dumbledore has warned everyone Voldermort is on the loose yet not every one believes him, or, to be more precise, wants to.  Some go so far as to question his competency.  Harry is also under suspicion - ""THE BOY WHO LIES"" cries the Daily Chronicle.  Indeed, after a near fatal dementor attack poor Harry finds himself facing the Ministry of Magic.  It is only the timely intervention of Dumbledore that prevents Harry's expulsion from Hogwarts!  There are changes at Harry's alma mata, not all good.  The new defense against the dark arts teacher is one Delores Umbridge, a ministry of magic troubleshooter and troublemaker who's sweet exterior hides an unpleasant persona with equally unpleasant plans for Hogwarts.  Harry finds himself suspected of foul play.  After all he was the only one that saw Cedric die, right?  Finally, there is Voldermort himself who is very much alive, and very, very dangerous.  He has freed several former death eaters from Azkabahn, the most vicious being the twisted Bellatrix LaStrange, responsible for the torture and murder of Neville Longbottom's parents.  Voldermort and Harry seem to have developed some sort of psychic connection.  Harry fears Voldermort may be able to read his thoughts, maybe even control his action.<br /><br />Yet there is still good.  Harry meets Luna Lovegate, a strange girl who seems strangely at peace. Harry's friends are back, as loyal as ever. In addition to Ron and Hermione, Sirius Black has returned along with Mad-Eye Moody and Remus Lupin.  They introduce Harry to the Order of the Phoenix, a group they formed to stop Voldermort when he first came to power.  As Umbridge's hold over Hogwarts becomes an iron grip, Hogwarts students rally around Harry and form the landestine ""Dumbedore's army"".  Will they be able to stop Umbridge and her lackey minions?  Will Harry learn the secret of his Voldermort connection?  Finally, what creature is Hagrid hiding this time?<br /><br />This movie, like its predecessors, is an excellent adaptation of the book.  Similar to The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix has a noticeably grim, serious feeling about it.  The actors are again allowed to act their age and their characters are developed accordingly.  Neville Longbottom's character has undergone the greatest change.  The yahoo of yesteryear has matured into a loyal friend and formidable fighter.  Most importantly, examples can be applied from The Order of the Phoenix to present day society.  In The Goblet of Fire, Dumbledore says, ""The time will soon come when we will have to choose between what is right and what is safe.""  The Order of the Phoenix shows the mistake of trying to do what is safe for the simple sake of doing so.  Neutering Hogwarts does not stop Voldermort nor does denying his existence make him go away. There will always be Voldermorts that have to be dealt with, and to deny their existence only makes them grow stronger."
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	Jeff is a master at his trade.  His characters are so life-like you will believe they are real people.  His routines are well crafted and spontaneous.  Great fun to watch...although you may want to preview the show before allowing young kids to watch as some of his routine is borderline crude...not terribly crude or anything...in a fun sort of way, but some of it might not be suitable for young kids.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	The DVD was in perfect condition and my kids love it!  Shipping was fast too!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"2005 has not been a banner year for movies, if I have to sit through one more super-hero movie I think I'm gonna puke. Between big Hollywood bombs and remake after remake, you can imagine the joy I received from watching this incredible movie. About as flawless as a movie can be this is film-making at it's best. I am not very familiar with Frank Miller and his 'graphic' novels, but I am very tempted to do some serious catching up with the man!!<br /><br />Have you ever seen a movie with so many a-list actors in your life? and here is what really surprised me, some of these actors generally make crappy movies (Brittany Murphy) but they all shine  here, big time. Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke get the most screen time and both excell mightily, I'm sure it won't happen but some oscar consideration for best actor should be considered for either if not both. Willis is at his best as a cop with a bad heart feeling his age trying to do good by his one true love, Jessica Alba, who plays a stripper with a big heart. She also is great in this, and thank god, because she followed this with 'Fantastic 4' why Jessica, why? Mickey Rourke, who I have always enjoyed, even in some of his more poor movies, is just stunning here, he plays this so well, he makes sure you will be thinking of this character weeks after you've seen it. I have now seen this three times and his portrayal of a man fighting all kinds of inner demons, not to mention a serial killer and a corrupt priest  (played very well and very creepy by Rutger Hauer) is something I'll never forget.<br /><br />Clive Owen is 3rd in the depth chart, but what a job he does, and I think he needed this, it makes people forget he did the awful 'King Arthur' he plays a cop trying to save his lady from a real low-life of a man played brilliantly by Benicio Del Toro. I mean this man is such a total sleaze-bag, and Del Toro absolutely hams it up, I'm guessing he had a blast playing this role. Brittany Murphy, and I can't believe I'm going to say this, is pretty solid as Owen's girlfriend. This is the same woman who did 'Little Black Book' and 'Uptown Girls' so this was a welcome change, hopefully this will help her pick better roles in the future, cuz' she is very attractive and really not that bad of an actress.<br /><br />Moving on, some of the smaller roles are some of the best. Now this may seem strange to most, but I think Elijah Wood (yes, Frodo) should be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. He does not say a word, but his performance as the serial killer is down right scary. The facial expressions he uses are sinister and perfectly timed, you watch they way he ""meets his maker"" and tell me that didn't make the hair on your neck stand right up!!! Devon  Aki is Meho, another who does not say a word, but is enchanting, until she whips out of of her many weapons and does some really not so nice things to alot of bad men. This was followed by D.E.B.S. Devon.......again, why?<br /><br />Rosario Dawson is sexy as hell as Gail, one of Clive Owen's former flings, she too is a bad-ass and Nick Stahl is the son of senator Power's Boothe, both are scum-bags, but Stahl is just nasty, nasty, nasty. His scenes with Willis and Alba towards the end are sensational to say the least. Michael Madsen, Alexis Bledel, and Carla Gugino also co-star, and like I said earlier, all contribute in one way or another.<br /><br />My only tiny, and I mean very tiny, complaint is Michael Clarke Duncan, he is very unbelievable and his role lacked the edge and depth of every other character, so this is two poor showings in a row from him, as he was really bad in 'Daredevil' but no big deal as most of that movie was atrocious.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez, for the most part, is a visually gifted director, he has a special way of showcasing violence in a stylized way that few can compare with.'Desperado' is one of my all time favorites and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one of the better horror vampire movies ever made. Although I have not seen any of the 'Spy Kids' movies, I know from there commercial success and with talking to alot of kids that atleast the first two are very well done. So it's a real shame that I recently heard that his latest kids fare, 'Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl' was such a flop.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this movie, it is hands down the best of the year, and I really hope it is not forgotten around academy awards season. This is expertly acted and directed, and is simply one of the best-looking movie's I can remember. I hear there is a new version coming out, with extended scenes and the infamous ""not rated"" tag. So you can bet I'll be first in-line when the date is announced.<br /><br />acting.............5 stars, Rourke and Willis amaze, so does the rest<br /><br />directing..........5 stars, Rodriguez is so gifted<br /><br />special effects....5 stars, Not over-done, perfectly timed.<br /><br />action rating......5 stars, Amazing gun-fights, great chase scenes, suspense and a few one-liners thown in as well<br /><br />quality............5 stars, If I could give higher I would, incredible looking movie, no grain, no gliches, flawless!!!"
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"They are now showing this feature on The Family Channel, courtesy of your local cable company, so I doubt there are many people out there who haven't seen Polar Express at least once. To each his own.<br />You know, offhand, I think it would be very dreary if classic Christmas features began to resemble each other, or imitated each other, simply because there was an isolated working formula that pleased the mass audience. So I am really open to newness and fresh material, because great new features don't really take away from those beloved Christmas classics, but actually keeps the home fires burning.<br />So is with The Polar Express. I don't expect any Christmas fantasy or calamity to embrace all the possible angles of Christmas, but I do expect a heartfelt experiance.<br />Animation films are never required to be logical, and quite frankly, that is the extreme attractiveness of animation in the first place. You can get away with alot. If we demanded animation to be on the planes of logical procedures, Bugs Bunny would have been boiled in a stew in a heartbeat, but he always manages to get out of the most difficult situations, simply by kissing the most hardened foe. . . on the lips. THAT'S COMEDY! So I don't expect features like Polar Express to be entirely logical, just fairly to the point of speculation that IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED LIKE THIS on Christmas Eve.<br />The premise of children even leaving there warm homes into the stone cold with just a bathrobe in itself defies reality comprehension. So as long as I'm in the comfort of my own home watching children baring the winter Christmas Eve cosmos in jamies, is their problem.<br />Now I admit, that having a lone man luring children on to an unknown midnight vehicle is a bit suspicious, especially without talk of consent from their parents to do so, it is a well known fact that Peter Pan himself has used this same sort of scheme with Michael, John, and Wendy.<br />What else is new?<br />For the most part, it is also likely this could have been somewhat of a dream, but like The Wizard Of Oz, it is supposedly not because unlike poor Dorothy who only had Toto as a living witness, our main childhood focus here has a bit of hardcore evidence.<br />My main concern is that throughout all the angles of what if, and why did it happen this way blah, blah, blah. . . I liked this movie. ALOT!<br />It's beautiful to look at like a 3D Christmas traditional card opening up it's telltale magic for all those who want to (yes I'll say it) ""Believe"".<br />And what more do we need from the land of Christmas anyway?"
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	Even though the show starts out a little slow, and even though there are several plot holes, the show has many intense moments that make up for; specifically the surgery scene.  The visuals and special effects are extraordinary, and the acting, mostly from Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender (as Elizabeth Shaw and the android David respectively), is very well done.  The ending is also very well done and is an obvious setup for a future sequal(s).  This show is definitely one of the beginning pieces to the Alien prequal (Ridley Scott confirmed he was going to do more), and even though it leaves multiple unanswered questions, it is definitely worth watching; especially if you are a sci-fi or an alien fan in particular.
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	"I barely made it all the way through this movie.  It's too predictable and kind of boring in my opinion.  I guessed a few lines correctly before the actors and/or actresses spoke.  lol  That's how predictable it is.  I'll take ""Dark Knight"" over this any day."
B0006989TE	2.0	b	"The Village is such a disappointment after Shyamalan's previous film, Signs. With a rather lackluster story, a dull premise, and a plodding exposition, the film lumbers through the first hour, with lots of ""fake"" scares. The eventual revelation isn't really that revelatory, and when it comes, one is almost thankful because the movie is over and you can go home. Shyamalan is really going to have to think of a new ""hook"" for his next endeavor because his trademark Hitchcockian imitation thrill rides are becoming a little shop worn.<br /><br />Shyamalan starts with a steady, mannered and prestigious setup - there are lots of misty woods, and winds that strategically sweep through the leaf blown town. He lavishes The Village with a spooky atmosphere, elaborate set design, rich cinematography, premeditated pacing, an eerie soundtrack, and of course, hushed, earnest almost wooden performances from his cast. But the actual story, and eventual improbable surprise about the true nature of the village just doesn't match his initial premise.<br /><br />A tombstone in the first scene of the movie tells us that the year is 1897, and the townsfolk have suffered a terrible loss. They seem be pretty self sufficient - they tend their sheep, a council of elders runs them, and they are wary of ever going near the woods, beyond the safety of the yellow flags and fiery torches at the perimeter of the village.  Everyone speaks a lot about ""that which we don't speak of,"" meaning some, strange, probably malevolent creatures that purportedly live in the woods. According to an ancient truce, the village folk do not go into the woods, and the wood's creatures are not supposed to go into the village. The creatures are supposed to like red, so everything red, including flowers and berries, is destroyed. Young Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) is a kind of rebel and upstart and he believes he should travel through the forest to the town to get medical supplies. The town leader, Edward Walker (William Hurt), rejects the idea. Lucius's mom Alice (Sigourney Weaver) wonders why such notions get in his head.<br /><br />Edward has a crush on Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard.), a blind girl who sees auras and hears strange, spooky noises coming from the woods. But Ivy is also beloved by Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), the village idiot. Noah constantly breaks out into unexplained laughter when the townspeople hear noises emanating from the woods. Lucius keeps tempting the creatures by picking red berries just inside the perimeter. Soon, the creatures are glimpsed invading the town, skinning the livestock, and leaving red marks on doors. After Noah stabs Lucius in a fit of jealousy, Walker decides to send Ivy through the woods alone to get the much needed medical supplies from the Town. His reasoning for sending a blind girl into the woods becomes apparent later in the film.<br /><br />As Ivy walks through the woods, Shyamalan lays on the fear and suspense. And when Ivy actually finds someone outside the forest that can help her, the viewer realizes that they have just been duped in what was really a simple-minded audience head game. The performances are generally wooden and awful. Brody is especially bad as he cackles, rolls his eyes and howls like a madman. The Village has some nice moments of suspense, and Shyamalan says some interesting things about the culture of fear, but generally the movie reeks of shop worn, gothic horror. It's Frontier House with smoke and mirrors - just awful. Mike Leonard August 04."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"This guy is amazing.  Funny stuff.  I don't normally view the ""extras"" on a DVD, however, this making of his doll is awesome to see.  Well worth the watch.  I was in tears."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Iron Man is without a doubt, Marvel's next hit franchise. You could say it's the new ""Spider-Man"" and boy, does this trilogy look promising with its first chapter.<br /><br />How great is Iron Man? Well consider that I was still able to see it over one month since it's release date and it's still showing with multiple show times. Famed film critic Roger Ebert gave it a perfect four stars even. It could be this summer's top movie just as Transformers was 2007's.<br /><br />Iron Man reminds me a lot of the first Spider-Man film in how the story is not terribly complex but dynamic enough with everything else solid. Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Tony Stark, a intelligent, B.A. businessman & engineer. Gwyneth Paltrow who plays Pepper Potts, Stark's secretary and love interest, is able to successfully act with Downey Jr. so that their two characters show authentic chemistry. Every character was perfectly cast in my opinion.<br /><br />Industrial Light & Magic delivers again this summer with their work in Iron Man. Although it didn't blow me away like Transformers visuals did, the movie's effects were top notch quality and made the experience all the more enjoyable.<br />It seemed like an interesting, maybe even risky choice to have the musical score consist mainly of guitar-heavy, rock-like tracks but it turned out completely fitting with Tony Stark's personality and the mechanical brawn of Iron Man.<br /><br />All I can say to finish this review is to go see Iron Man if you haven't. Do not miss out on one of the best summer blockbusters of 2008!"
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	This video was suppose to be used but was in excellent condition, very pleased. Thank you!
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	Prometheus had so much hype and promise, but it was an ultimate failure.  It is essentially a new version of Alien except it has MULTIPLE plot holes, horrible characters, horrible decisions made by characters, and it just went on way too long.  What an abysmal experience this was.  The movie was a chore to get through, and the only thing I think about in the end was how I could get my money back.
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	Little too corny, plus I don't like Robert Downey Jr, anyway.<br /><br />It should have been DARK, like the Batman movies
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Disappointing!  With all the hype this movie got, we thought this would be an awesome movie.  It was a dud, just didn't live up to the hype for us.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"Having watched Martin Scorsese's Oscar winning film The Departed twice now, I am  ready to offer up my opinion of the film.<br /><br />The Plot: Set in South Boston, this crime drama centers around the state police force, and its all out war on organized crime.<br /><br />Young and somewhat troubled undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). While Billy is quickly gaining Costello's favor, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), is a hardened young criminal who has found way into the police department as an informer for the syndicate--Quickly rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit.<br /><br />Each man finds himself deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of operations he is made privy. But when it becomes clear to both the gangsters and the police that there lurks a mole, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy -- and each of the two men must now race to uncover the identity of the other, in time to save himself.<br /><br />My Take: Based on the 2002 Japanese film, Mou gaan dou (Infernal Affairs), The Departed has all of the ingredients that one would expect from a Scorsese film in the mob genre. Of course, William Monahan's script gives the director plenty to work with...Does it rise to the level of perfection that is, a Goodfellas, (1990) Taxi Driver (1976) Raging Bull (1980) or Cape Fear (1991) ? The answer to that question is that the movie ultimately lands just behind all of those classics I mentioned in the great one's filmography--but miles and miles ahead of the worst, just the same.<br /><br />Three things that really nudged at me about the flick-- taking away from an otherwise flawless film...<br /><br />--There's a point in the film where DiCaprio and Damon's characters engage in a game of cat and mouse as they try to expose each other without getting taken out...Under normal circumstances, this sequence would have been the centerpiece, made memorable through its staging and editing. I don't know what happened here, but this scene yielded, little tension or surprise. Editor Thelma Schoonmaker usually knows how to make this work but the pacing seemed off somehow. You can't have a great set-up and then blow it a crucial time in the story. I felt like I was watching a re-run of a 70's era TV cop show. I can't believe I just typed that about a Scorsese picture<br /><br />--Vera Farmiga as Madolyn, the woman who comes between Billy and Colin, shares little chemistry with either Damon or DiCaprio. As pretty much the only female in the ""men's room""...She should have sparks with someone.<br /><br />--The Bostonian accents--Some cast members sounded really bad...and and that was really distracting. Damon, who's originally from Boston, is perhaps the worst offender. Leo fares much much better with his accent. I find it ironic though, that DiCaprio gets Oscar attention for Blood Diamond but not for The Departed--When by all account--his performance in the mob pic is better then that of BD-I digress...<br /><br />The film succeeds though thanks to everything else. Yes, Jack Nicholson is playing a character he's done a thousand times before, but gosh darn it it works here. Also doing yeoman's work is Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and of course, Mark Wahlberg. And the ending is just spectacular...<br /><br />The Two-Disc Special Edition DVD offers up some great extras, even though not a whole lot of the stuff, actually focuses on the film.<br /><br />A 21-minute featurette titled ""Stranger Than Fiction"" about Whitey Bulger, the legendary South Boston mobster on whom the film's Frank Costello was loosely based is first up. Bulger's tale is told by various folks in the know. According to this featurette, Bulger has been on the lam since 1995 and is number two on the F.B.I.'s Ten Most Wanted List. Interesting real-life drama.<br /><br />The best bonus material in the DVD set is ""Scorsese on Scorsese,"" an hour-and-a-half documentary made for Turner Classic Movies by Richard Schickel . Scorsese talks about his life and work. Taking us through his earliest days through 2004's The Aviator ending with that TV commercial he appeared in for American Express .<br /><br />A 24-minute featurette ""Crossing Criminal Cultures"" takes a look at the how the gangster film has evolved over the decades--with Scorsese at its center.<br /><br />There is a collection of nine deleted/extended scenes--complete with intros from the director. Some of these scenes are quite good, but were rightfully omitted, for time and pace.<br /><br />The theatrical trailer tops off the set.<br /><br />Overall: I may have had some unexpected issues with The Departed, but none of them bothered me enough to be really critical. This is a must see movie for sure...Definitely buy or rent, depending on how much you like Scorsese"
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Saw this Harry in the movies.  Was Great!!! Had to get this movie, because I own all the one's that are out now!  It's a little darker than the other Harry movie's, but still a Great movie.  Looking forward to the final one!!
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	The product was suppose to be like new and several of the disc will not play well; movement hangs and moves at 1/2 speed. Not super satisfied. Also note that work out is great for the young but not for anyone that has hip or knee pain; too much jumping. Easy to modify at lower level but would not pay price if one has joint pain.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"I am not a gangster movie fan...I don't even know if I have seen other movies by this director.  I thought it looked like it would be a good movie just because I like Jack Nicholson.  I saw it prior to the whole Oscar thing and most of the time, I don't like the movies that recieve high honors in that arena.  I watched this movie (the first time) and got a little confused in the beginning because of the way it is set up, but I told myself ""Just plow through it and hopefully it will make sense by the ending.""  I was right.  The ending blew me away.  The music is sooooooo awesome and got me into it right from the start.  I absolutely fell in love with Mark Walhberg and Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie.  This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time (I have since watched it 3 times now).  The whole good cop, bad cop storyline is so intriguing.  There are many questions I had at the end...but it didn't really matter.  The music, the acting and the plot gets you going from the start.  I can't say enough about this movie...watch it, listen to the soundtrack and enjoy!!!  Finally, a best picture that I think really deserved best picture.  And oh my, Jack Nicholson really is the coolest, badest, bad guy out there."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Since watching this movie, my marriage has grown closer. Not only has it helped my marriage it has helped me in other relationships in my life, such as with my children. I have grown closer to the people I love along with loving others that I often ignore. This movie will change your life, if you will just watch it with an open heart. It was one of the best investments I have ever made. I will buy other movies that Affirm Films has made. They are wholesome and great for the family. They shine with such depth and inspiration.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	I saw the movie in 3D in theater and was an awesome movie. However when I purchased the Blu-Ray 3D 4-disc collection set from Amazon, none of the disc would play in my Pioneer Elite 3D Blu-Ray Disc player. I troubleshooted and made many attempts and nothing worked. The disc had no aparent scratches and are completely clean. I can play any other 3D Blu-Ray movies, but not this one. I even tried playing the 2D version and that also didnt work. Looking online I discovered many other people are experiencing the same problems. So evidently there are some bad batches of defective disc. I am going to return my 4-disc collection set of Prometheus to Amazon for a exchange. I just hope I get one that works. Otherwise I would give it a 5-star rating, as I loved the movie.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I bought this on launch day for the UMD and DVD versions!  I bought a copy for my homedawg, DJ Honeybear, and the UMD version for myself!  I could not believe the cinematic brilliance of this movie!  Truely one of the best cinematic features I've ever seen in my life!<br /><br />Somebody else said ""jawdropping video presentation"" or words to that effect, and I would have to agree with that!  Clearly an award winner in this department!<br /><br />Just writing this review and reading the other reviews, is making me want to rewatch it.  I also will probably get the DVD special edition of this movie by this Holiday.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!!"
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Fireproof is a drama, it isn't really an action film.  It is also pretty low budget so don't expect high end special effects.  But it does have a story to tell and does a pretty solid job of doing it.<br /><br />The acting for the most part is not good, most of it is poor but the actors do try and you can tell.  Kirk Cameron's acting is fine, maybe not acedemy award excellence, but honestly he does play his role very well with a more well trained supporting cast this film would really have shined and his performance might have stood out even more.  The Lt. he plays off of does a pretty solid if not great job, and the actor playing his character's dad does a fine job.  Most of the scenes with just Kirk and his dad are excellent and that is why I think with a better cast you might think even more highly of Kirk's work.<br /><br />The story is excellent, and for one who is married very much how things are.  Mariage is more about learning about how to live with each other then you can know until you get there.  It also takes constant care and work, something Kirk's character learns along the journey he takes in the film.<br /><br />My wife brought this home and I was tempted to skip it, but after a bit I got sucked in.  I saw in Kirk's character many of the flaws I had as a husband, and have tried to overcome.  Learning to pitch in around the house even when you are tired, learning to give up some personal things for each other, and learning to do for each other without being asked all sound so simple.  But wait until you get married, what once seemed simple can overwhelm and evade you.  You have to be dedicated to your spouse and family in ways I can not even write, but the film does a good job of showing.<br /><br />Sure production quality and general side character acting is subpar, but generally clean.  But the main character and story are excellent and well done.  I really enjoyed it a ton.<br /><br />Just for the record I am not a bible belt person, I live in NY and was born and raised in NJ.  I'm north eastern all the way, I am not born again nor does the concept work for me.  I am christian though but even were I not many of the points and the general theme really should resonate with any married person.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	I missed this in the theatre, still enthralled by the spectacle of Avengers and am glad that I did. Kristen Stewart is just so wooden. She acts like she doesn't care about anything, which might've worked for Bella. Chris Hemsworth was all right, playing the strong brute. But the story was justkinda blah for me. If you want a modern retelling of fairy tales, watch Once upon a time. Much more inventive.
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	I love shows like The Shield, The Wire, Rome and Deadwood - shows that critics love and that get low ratings. I watched the first 4 episodes of True Blood, and that's four hours of my life I'll never get back. It's truly awful, the worst thing I've endured in years.<br /><br />My wife still watches, mostly because it's softcore porn and she's decided it's too awful to quit watching. She mostly laughs hysterically at it.<br /><br />Other than laughing at how terrible it is and looking at titties, there is no reason to watch this show. Absolutely horrible acting, and every single character is a terrible person.<br /><br />1/5 Stars.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	From the opening scene to the final roll of the credits, Cars was a delight for me and my whole family. I'm not a big fan of Owen Wilson, but Cars was so good that I forgot that he was voicing Lightning McQueen, the rookie star vying for the Piston Cup and the prestigious Dynoco sponsorship.<br /><br />Everything in this movie was cars. Even the flies were tiny VW bugs. The animation was so crisp and clean that during the race at the beginning of the movie, some of the racing segments looked like real cars zooming around the track.<br /><br />The storyline is simple, yet quite relevant in this day and age of superstar athletes and the hunger for fame. Lightning, forced to serve community service in a forgotten town called Radiator Springs, ultimately learns that it's more important to be a champion on the inside, rather than on the outside with trophies and titles.<br /><br />I actually didn't expect the movie to end the way it did, but after a bit I was glad for the way it ended. A very strange side effect of seeing this movie in the theater was that on my way home, I kept seeing cars as humanlike, rather than strictly machinery. That's how well Pixar brought the cars to life. They made me see cars as alive (For about an hour. I'm not completely crazy.)<br /><br />From my two-year-old on up, everyone in my family enjoyed Cars, and I actually came to like Owen Wilson as well.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie was wonderful to just watch and enjoy. It also has amazing values in the whole story line. Anyone at any age will enjoy this movie. Children and and person that loves cars will definately love it. My family had fun finding all of the 'hidden' cars parts in the scenery. Once you start finding them, you can't stop finding more. The animation was unbelievable. The characters were wonderful and delightful. I just cannot say anything bad about this movie.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"Pixar has always made great films and Cars is no exception.  The pure digital transfer looks beautiful in HiDef with a BluRay player and 1080p HDTV (Sony PS3 and Samsung 40"" in my case).  Colors are spectactular.  I love the music and voice acting Pixar put together as well.  Click and Clack, the Tapert brothers from NPR as the Rusteeze owners was an especially nice touch.  The plot of the film is kid friendly but also takes adults back to the time when people drove cars to drive cars and meet people, not get somewhere.  Now the occasional car meet at the local drive in diner (if any are left in your town) is about all that is left of this culture.  Cars reminds us all of that time not long ago."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Anyone with a conscience needs to watch this movie about feed lots and the American meat industry.  You will never feel the same when you purchase chicken, beef, or pork from your supermarket.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	One of the best commedians I have ever seen.  Can watch over and over again, and still laugh.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	I rarely watch movies anymore because they all seem so repeatative but Sin City is different. The storylines that weave in and out of each other are fantastic although the dialogue is wooden at times (although I think that this is intentional.) Its strange how disturbing most of the plot lines are and yet, I was not disturbed by the movie in general.  The violence and sex are not for the faint of heart (keep the kids out!)  Overall, one of the most unique movies to come out in decades.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I really liked this movie alot.  Our marriage wasn't in trouble, but we watched this together in order to challenge us.  It really called us to something deeper and greater.  I recommend it to anyone looking for answers on how to fix their marriage or anyone who just wants tips on how to improve their marriage.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	I loved Iron Man comic books when I was a kid.  I always wanted to see what Iron Man looked like moving, flying and punching in real-time.  The only letdown was the ridiculous beginning when Tony Stark builds his first suit in a cave, pounding heated metal like a medieval blacksmith.  However you can forget about the beginning or even fast forward past it and still enjoy the rest of the movie.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Saw Cars 2 earlier this week and I am in the minority it seems who actually liked it almost as much as the first film. After checking out Cars last night, I'll amend what I said about Cars 2 being as good and admit that Cars had a more focused storyline and was also a little funnier.<br /><br />In a nutshell, a little red race car named Lightning McQueen has issues, particularly he's selfish, narcissistic, and doesn't need a pit crew. A mishap en route to California's Piston Cup to settle a 3 way tiebreaker lands him in a lazy southwest desert town occupied by old forgotten automobiles where McQueen learns that the universe doesn't revolve around him and that sometimes we all need to slow down and smell the roses.<br /><br />Immediate impressions can be deceiving. From not having seen this film in a few years I thought its age would show against the sequel but this wasn't the case as this film still looks and sounds equally as beautiful and powerful as its successor. In my Cars 2 review I said that it looked superior to this film but seeing them side by side I'd have to take that back. Some say that this film is shallow compared to Pixar's other films but I disagree. Also, a big kudos to the characters in this film. What I mean is that the cars match the personalities they embody perfectly. Hudson, the big Buick with the big chrome grill behaves exactly how it looks, as does ol' rusty bucktoothed Mater, and my favorites Guido (Volkswagen) and Luigi (forklift). This is a great film and one that I'd rank with some of my favorite live action car films.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	I was surprised but I really did like this movie and recommend it to anyone.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	if marty doesn't win an academy award this time i will never watch the academy awards again. dicaprio should win too. best performance i've seen all year. i've quickly become a leo fan ever since the aviator. much better then the orginal film it was based on in my opinion.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	The product arrived in a good time and came in perfect shape. I loved it
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	bought this for my 2 year old son on is birthday and we have yet to stop watching it. Absolutely loved the movie and I do as well.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	"After seeing the trailers, I thought Snow White and the Huntsman would be an interesting film. Boy was I disappointed. I am actually quite shocked there are so many good reviews of this film. This may mean this review gets ""unhelpful"" by many of the committed. Worth the risk.<br /><br />First, the script is so bad you can't suspend belief and enter the world of the film. This is necessary to get any sort of attachment to any of the characters. It is so bad that Hemsworth's shining moment sparks, at best, a small emotional thought. With a better script, there wouldn't be a dry eye in the theater. Multiple characters die and it is like watching coworkers eat. Boring. The characters has less depth than the average cartoon character. And there is no real sense of peril for any of the characters at any time in the movie. Ho hum! At best I can call this an interesting twist on the Snow White story that falls flat.<br /><br />Second, I find it really hard to read reviews that have positive things to say about the acting. Christine Stewart is so bad, I found myself wishing she was a mime in her scenes. Charlize Theron, who has been given kudos for the role, is only good if you regard someone who can scream convincingly a good actor/actress. Hemsworth is more eye candy for the ladies in the film, but does win for the best acting in the film. Unfortunately, his moments are short in the script, so you don't get to see much of his acting. The rest of the characters are pretty much throw away.<br /><br />Third, the cinematography and editing are nauseating. Not only figuratively speaking, at times the use of camera trickery and fast cuts (to enhance the action?) almost make you want to vomit. Parts of the battle and chase scenes are shot using a badly implemented ""Saving Private Ryan"" camera trick that simply makes your eyes boggle. Private Ryan used the narrow slit trick to give the feeling you were watching something that felt unreal, while this film uses it in a way that makes you want to shut your eyes to stop the madness.<br /><br />With so much bad, I guess the fault falls on the director, Rupert Sanders. I hope his craft matures, as this film is awful.<br /><br />The worst thing about this film is it had so much potential. The idea of taking the Snow White story and twisting it with a queen who possessed so great a chip on her shoulders is quite fascinating. Handled by better scriptwriters, it would have been magnificent. Directed by someone who understood a bit more about subtlety, it would have possessed far more intrigue. This is extremely important when you already know the story. And the battle scenes could have done without the badly implemented ""Private Ryan"" type of ""unreality"". In fact, being a bit more subtle in camera work and proper ""painting of the film canvas"" would have made the ride far more enjoyable.<br /><br />Are there any shining moments? Certainly. It is interesting to see Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins as dwarfs. The CGI to accomplish this is far better than the hobbits in Lord of the Rings. And there are some nice battle scenes (when the camera trickery is not overused). The costuming is wonderful and the lighting is done very well. If the script held up the story better, you could appreciate the world more."
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	like the title says... story isnt too impressive after ironman escapes prison... the graphics are great though! I WILL NOT WATCH IRONMAN II! Why? marvel booted mr. warmachine (Terance Howard) off the cast! Greedy Marvel!
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	Great movie but I could have bought it at Meijers for 16.99 and had it on the day it was released.  Instead I received it over a week later.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	It's great being able to streamline videos from Amazon! The movie was great! I will definitely rent more movies in the future.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	The miniseries John Adams is a terrific story of John Adams, one of the original Founding Fathers, his family, and the people he knew and interacted with. Paul Giamatti is incredible in the title role as John Adams;  Laura Linney is also wonderful as Abigail Adams.  Their story moved me to tears in the end and left me wanting to know more about them and others who were instrumental in the founding of our country. Added bonuses are the brief vignettes showing the making of the series. I hope that others will come away from it as I did wanting to know more and with a renewed appreciation for these people and what they went through. I loved it and I highly recommend it.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	I really enjoyed watching this Coen Bro's film. I thought the acting by the entire cast was first rate. Javier Bardem's portrayal of a psychopathic killer actually scared me. Loved it!!
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"OK. The 1st time I saw this movie, I hated it. I put it on My Top 10 Worst List. There are two twists in the film. I did not like the 1st one and the 2nd one was brilliant. But this 1st twist was a cliche and just kind of ruined the film for me. Now on 2nd viewing however I did like it, but I think it remains Shyamalans worst film. He had a great premise, he just messed up<br /><br />a little bit. Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt,<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver, and Adrien Brody are all great, but it is Howard who gives the best performance in the film. After the death of a young child, Lucius Hunt (Phoenix) asks the village elders to let him venture into the woods, which are haunted by seemingly large porcupines, and go to the towns and retrieve medicines for other people who may be sick. The elders decline.<br /><br />Then, we venture into Lucius's love life with Ivy (Howard) much to the dissapointment of the village idiot Noah (Brody). When a major event happens however, Ivy must venture into the woods alone. Now the ""creatures"" that lurk in the woods are very cool looking. The costume designer did quite well and as usual Shyamalan throws in his signature twists. So, while I did like the film the 2nd time, I will tell 1st time haters of ""The Village"" to watch it again. B.<br /><br />(Note: My Original Grade was ""C"")"
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	In a world where every movie seems to be a re-make of some sort this movie provides a fresh story of its own. Many will probably be annoyed with the lack of closure at the end of the film but in my opinion it adds to the mystic of the story.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Beautiful visuals (and color), strong story, acting fit the story.  I would have given 4.5 stars with LOTR at a 5.<br />Will watch again!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"So, rather than repeat everything that has already been said, I just want to express my opinion. First, after watching this, I'm glad I don't like beef because I definitely wouldn't after this. The food industry is another example of corrupt big business takeovers, which is pretty much in every industry. Actually, it's kind of frightening that, not only can someone patent a seed, if that plant's seed spreads into your land through natural means (you know, like the way seeds spread for millions of years before humans started playing around with them), you can still get into trouble and the burden of proof seems to be on you as the accused...so much for the constitution but we know how much that means in this day and age anyway (i.e. the Patriot Act amongst others, go ahead and check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IX4CC0"">The End of America: Director's Cut</a>, that's another disturbing one).<br /><br />After watching this, I almost want to just start hunting and growing my own food except that a big corporation may come in and accuse me of patent theft somehow and force me to hire some high priced lawyer to prove my innocence. All that said, this is a real eye opener and I think everyone in America should watch it."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This has to be the best DVD in all time. I watched alone and was laughing so hard I cried. Then I had to let my friends watch and I was laughing before they knew what was coming up.<br /><br />Then the best complement that I can give is I had to go see Jeff and his<br /><br />pals, so I drove 8 hours to see him at a improve...unbelieveable
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Cars is a fabulous movie! Complete genius! Paul Newman is awesome as Hudson!
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	I agree with Amazon's reviewer, Ellen Kim, that this chapter in the Indiana Jones 'serials' is the weakest, but still great handfuls of fun.  I think where it weakens is where Lucas and Spielberg don't entirely trust Indy to carry the film on his own amusing shoulders and instead pack the film full of CGI effects ... lots of them.  Indy is really the only movie hero who we watch because he is smart and witty and lovable.  His character is just about enough ... leave CGI to Pirates of the Caribbean. -- That said, this welcomed return of Indy unites him with a young rebel, Mutt Williams, on a search for a missing colleague of Dr Jones' -- Professor Harold Oxley.  In addition, Indy and Mutt must reach a legendary lost city via an alien skull before the Russians do (so that the Russians -- 1957 Russians, mind you -- can't rule the world ... somehow).  This all leads him back to Marion Ravenwood ... our real first love. -- The first half of this movie looks, feels and stirs viewers (old enough to remember sneaking into the theater to get mind-blown by Raider of Lost Ark) like vintage Indiana Jones.  The 2nd half is almost lost to the CGI fun-park that ensues.  Fine for other movies, but we watch and Indy movie to see Indy.  But the movie ends on a really touching note and the promise of more.  I really hope there's more.  Until then, there's this.  And that's fine.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This is a great documentary DVD that I've seen in a while. It explains the far side of the commercialized agriculture that is being done. I love all sections of the piece. Definitely it educates the consumer about how what they eat is produced. The good as well as the not so good sides of it. I used this DVD in my class to generate a discussion about the highly commercialized agriculture vs less commercialized agriculture. We all know that it's a challenge for a farmer or an agricultural operation to produce a product economically and efficiently with low cost and deliver it in the marker for a profit. This DVD deals with producing something faster, cheaper, in bulk and deliver it to the consumer oftentimes compromising environmental sustainability and consumer health. On the other hand, it also gives a great picture about how some other small scale agricultural businesses are done taking care of aforementioned problems. It also speaks well to the food safety related issue that is very important in the current time as we see a lot more plant and animal related products are being recalled than it used to be. It also has a good account on organic agriculture and how large companies grow through mergers and acquisitions. Overall, this is a job well done.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	This is a must have movie for Christmas! I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it and have started having Polar Express Pajama Party as of this year. It was a hit and I plan on making it a tradition for all my friends to bring their kids to. This movie is so well done and the amazing effects, story just make me all warm and fuzzy!<br /><br />If you're thinking you can watch this movie with your 3D player & TV & glasses, think again. You need the old school red/blue 3D glasses and it can give you a headache so don't buy it for the 3D effects. I would recommend just getting the blu-ray or regular dvd as the 3D is pretty useless. I hope that there might be a way to re-release it differently someday.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	Basically I thought it was a OK Harry Potter movie but was disappointed by the lack of lighting. Much of the movie was filmed in poor dark lighting and it made it very difficult to watch the movie.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Im amazed you are the first person to say this movie is bad. That this movie has no creativity. Ok, I understand about the movie mocking Afghanistan, I mean you know, from a comic movie, it should be realistic (sarcastic, if you are to dumb to understand). I Read your 1 star review on Incredible Hulk as well, yeah and you say Spider Man 3 was good. Dude Spider Man 3 was the most garbage comic movie I have ever seen, hell all of Spider Man is garbage except for the second, that was decent. So I just think, you have a bad taste in movies. Yeh, you know what is really funny? You never acknowleged the brilliant acting, the brilliant action, and the brilliant story, just Afghanistan. That makes you a bad reviewer too! Next thing you know, you will say Dark Knight was garbage! Dark Knight is in my top 5, if not the best movie I have seen. Iron Man is also in my top 5. Iron Man is one of those few movies that was amazing, it is a must - see, dont listen to Happy Camper, he doesn't have taste for good movies. HE RATES LIONS FOR LAMBS 5 STAR, WHAT AN IDIOT!!!! You make me sick Happy Camper, go away...
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This movie was hilarious. Peanut and Walter were the best I think. It made me laugh until I was crying. I highly recommend that if you haven't seen this then you need to watch it. And if its not in any of your local stores I strongly recommend ordering it from Amazon. They are inexpensive and fast. So go out and get your copy today.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	This is one of Jeff's best yet.  Achmed the dead terrosit, Walter and Peanut is everyone's favorites.  Would highly recommend this dvd for anyone who loves to laugh.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is an outstanding portrayal of our nation's birth. You get a sense of what it must have been like during this period in history. It may be slow at times but deliberately so in my opinion; so the viewer can digest how these men and at least one woman (Abigail Adams) debated the issues -- going to war for freedom or staying true to the king.  And after the war, how this country was going to move forward and if it would move forward at all.<br /><br />The dialog may be boring to some, but it gave me chills at times.  In France as Adams, Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin debate what kind of government they envision for their new country.  And Washington's inaugural, partly computer generated, yes, but nonetheless moving as Washington, speaking softly and barely audible, is shown as a bit shy about taking this new office; one of the many nuances that make these men come alive.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	The title of this set says it all.  It's insane!!  Be ready to sweat your butt off during these workouts.  I am super excited to start shedding those pounds off and looking and feeling good about myself.  If you want a crazy intense workout that you can do day after day, this is it!!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I love my country and after seeing John Adams I felt an even greater appreciation for my country, and our founding Fathers.<br /><br />I thought it was ironic that John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson died on July 4th.  Every American should see this movie, and if you do not enjoy watching movies then I<br /><br />strongly suggest reading the book that inspired the HBO Miniseries.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I bought this as a recommendation of a friend and although they tell you in it, ""It is the toughest workout you have ever done"" you don't understand how hard it is until you do it!!! plus it has the diet plan which is wonderful and not hard to follow at all!!!<br />I feel great and I totally recommend this DVD program."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is possibly the best miniseries that HBO has ever done.  I am not a history buff, but could become one if all miniseries were done this well.  It is well worth the money (and more).
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I really like this movie.  I thought they did a good job getting all the important parts of the story in the film without being too long.  The DA scenes were really well done.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Like others, I wanted to like this movie; however.... I like a twist on a known tale, and I was happy with the premise.  The cinematography was good and the darkness appropriate, lending the movie a good grittiness. What really killed the movie for me was the acting. Kristen Stewart was Kristen Stewart - it didn't really add anything, but wasn't wholly distracting either. However, if you've seen any of the Twilight movies, it is exactly the same - same expressions, same delivery, except with a par English accent. Perhaps this isn't entirely her fault, as the character is similar - a girl finds herself a target and is helped by anyone and everyone to stay alive. I wish my thoughts of Charlize Theron's performance were as positive. I don't  dislike her, and think she's done well in some of her movies - though not this one. It was as if she had substantial problems with her English accent, so decided to speak. very. slowly. to. compensate. Perhaps it was meant to be more dramatic, but I found completely distracting. The men's acting saved this movie for me: Chris Hemsworth was good, and the cast of dwarves was outstanding: Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, etc.  And it's a shame we didn't see more of Willam (Sam Claflin).<br /><br />The other niggle I had with this movie was the lack of originality in some parts. For me, the entire sequence of the group going to meet the duke was entirely too similar to the Lord of the Rings, down to the a cappella song accompanying the group walking along a cliff. Perhaps this was hard to avoid, considering the group was of similar size and make-up, but I think more effort could have been made to give it its own character - especially since they are looking to expand on this franchise.<br /><br />Again, I didn't hate this movie, but I far from loved it. I didn't think I went in with many expectations -- I was hoping to really enjoy it. Unfortunately, that was not the case.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I almost didn't go to see Iron Man because it didn't look very interesting but I took a chance and saw it and guess what? It was the best Marvel movie I have ever saw. Iron Man rules. If I were you I would buy Iron Man on DVD no questions asked.
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	I really disliked this movie<br /><br />it seems that it's totally from the female perspective here.<br /><br />And so it's ok for the woman to disrespect her husband and talk behind his back and cheat on him - all that's ok?
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Im amazed you are the first person to say this movie is bad. That this movie has no creativity.

B008UBYTRG	2.0	b	This is the first time I'd watched one of his shows.  I was prepped before hand by a huge JD fan who said he was really funny, even without his puppets.<br />He wasn't.<br />The first 15 minutes were standard observational/family related jokes.  I was bored and waiting for the puppets.<br />The last 65 minutes of the DVD were all about the puppets.  I thought the individual skits were too long.  I laughed a couple times here and there, but thought there was 5 minutes of each doll they could cut out (including the entire Peanut skit)<br />I don't really mind stereotypical humor, but Dunham had little else to offer.  Nothing groundbreaking, nothing edgy outside of a Jewish joke.  So it's no surprise that most people find him extremely entertaining.<br />If you like edgy material, look elsewhere.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	"The Polar Express book has long been a family favorite.  When marketing for this movie began Christmas of 2003, I looked forward to what was to come.  Charlie Rose interviewed Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis about the making of this film.  Their perspective was that the movie was very true to the book.  The beautiful illustrations of the book were skillfully captured by the movie.  There are also some new elements in the movie like a very captivating little girl who is a passenger seated very near the main character little boy.  Her introduction to the story add depth and dimension to the trip.  She compassionately saves a cup of hot chocolate for a little shy boy from the ""other side of the tracks.""  There is also the introduction of a hobo riding the roof and under carriage of the train.  (also played by Hanks.)  All in all, this story feels like a bedtime story your grandfather might have read to you on a chilly winter night.  I was charmed, yet not captivated.<br /><br />All in all... a good effort with great visuals.  Worth seeing."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Loved this movie.  It is so beautiful to look at it's amazing.  The actors are uniformly excellent here.  Bardem is a pure evil killing machine and will scare the crap out of you.  It is long, but it pulls you into the story so intently that it feels much shorter than its running time.  The Coens have done it again.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	This is a good movie for children and adults. Interesting storyline, bright colorful characters and graphics. Enjoy with your children or grandchildren.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I'm a Batman girl myself, but if they continue to make Iron Man films as good as this one then I'll become a fan.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. does a really good job in this film. His ability to make the one liners snap really works, and I was laughing at plenty of them. He was also really convincing as a genuis billionare weapons manufacturer. He almost made it look like a really cool and fun job.<br /><br />But of course it's not. He's kidnapped and forced to build, and use, his own weapon against himself and his country. But instead of doing that he invents a suit that turns out to be an awesome piece of technology.<br /><br />The special effects are really cool in this movie. They don't really look CGI or anything at all. They feel pretty real even though you know none of it is likely to be possible in say next year.<br /><br />The movie flows along at a pretty good pace. It's rather short, but you don't notice it until the movie is done. I really like that it seems longer, but isn't.<br /><br />The entire cast I felt was really good in this. The action was perfect, the imaginative weapons and gadgets on the suit were hot. The robots were even a life to themselves.<br /><br />Super cool movie.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	i love this movie i gave it as a gift. But not before ripping a copy for myself. HAHAHA IWIN!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This Movie is a great way to spend family time. Very cute. The whole family will love it. Thank you
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	"On my first play of this movie I noticed how digitally crappy the image looked.  I have never, ever had a DVD with so many digital artifacts throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />I am not referring to bad CGI during an action sequence, I am referring to inexcusably bad DVD encoding.  Even with mild background movement, the details and colors become blocky, muddied, and unnatural.<br /><br />I do have an HDTV and a progressive scan DVD player, so with a normal setup the differences may not be noticeable, but I firmly believe the quality of this DVD encoding was intentionally reduced to enhance the benefit of owning the HD version of this movie available on Blu-ray.<br /><br />I work for a company that provides Digital TV over DSL using MPEG 4 compression, and if we lower the encoding quality, the results look the same as how this whole movie looks, ""just barely"" good enough."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Ok, I'll admit to not being done, but the book gives you so much to chew on, you honestly need to read a section then digest it. Of course there is the typical that will make you angry, etc., but it will also open your eyes. Be the change you want to be in this world. Start somewhere. My family has.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"This is a truly wonderful and well-done effort, and a true Holiday Classic in the vein of ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" ""A Christmas Story,"" ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas (Boris Karloff Version)"" and ""A Christmas Carol."" The idea to use motion-capture animation just added to the mystique and feel of the movie as well. It is amazing how realistic the movie looks; the characters do not look animated at all, in my view. The story is timeless too-a young boy (who is only called ""Hero-Boy"" in the film) who has lost his faith in Christmas boards a mysterious train, The Polar Express, where the Conductor (voiced by Tom Hanks) is desperately trying to get back to the North Pole before Santa makes his run. He meets ""Hero-Girl,"" an African-American about his same age, a young boy named Billy (also known as ""Lonely-Boy"") and ""Know-It-All,"" a somewhat too smart for his own good young boy. The journey has many twists and turns to the North Pole, including a meeting with a mysterious Hobo (also voiced by Hanks). All of the children have a ""Golden Ticket"" with letters punched onto them (the significance of this is revealed by the end of the movie). The boy meets Santa at the North Pole, although does not believe in him at first. I will not give away too much more, but this is a true Holiday Classic which deserves to be in every DVD collection. I highly recommend this movie."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"One of the best movies in the last few years. Got some action, but mostly about the characters and their inter-relationships. Loosly based on resently captured ""Whitey"" Bulger with Jack Nickleson playing his role. Good drama, suprises and plot twists. Never a dull moment. Based in Boston the accents are good and the backgrounds are spot on. This movie should be in everyone's collection! Dirrected excellently by Martin Scorcesi."
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"There is no substance to this move except for some special effects. The characters seem to be brain dead, it feels like a ""zombies vs alien"" movie."
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"I was so intrigue by this movie that I went to see it as soon as it came out. It is an amazing movie with an amazing cast. Unfortunatelly, a lot of the reviews are not giving it justice because: A) they are too young to appreciated the meaning of the story and to realize is not a ""Freddy vs. Jason"" type of movie.<br /><br />B) most men went thinking it was going to be one of those action/terror movies, where you see an arm being cut off in mid air. This movie is neither. Is a well written and evelop story and so worth buying it. I am going shopping tonight!"
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Dunham has to be one of the funniest guys around.<br />Totally amazing how he can be himself and have all those altar-egos.<br />Peanut is the most amazing. How he can be calm and collected and have<br />Peanut is off the wall.<br />Very worth watching, better to own.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I watched this series when it was on cable, and knew that I needed to buy it on DVD. The series is awesome and very addictive. It keeps you on your toes, as you are not sure what is going to happen next. Please note, however, that I most definitely would not recommend children watching this series. It most assuredly is adult-only, as there is ample nudity.<br /><br />The DVDs, as well, are of top-notch quality. The picture quality is great, the menus are easy to navigate, and the bonus features are interesting and funny.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	This was my first purchase with amazon.com and I was totally satisfied with everything. The movie came as stated, new in package. I will be purchasing items from here again. The experience was very good.
B001684L0A	3.0	b	John Adams. Sadly while the movie makes some historical revisions in character and misses or overlooks other important facts, the movie series itself is truly a love story in the birth of a Nation and of husband and wife and of friendship. After reading many of the reviews of this miniseries I have become torn and inquisitive. The miniseries John Adams, and the before mentioned, has now inspired me to read the book of the same title by David McCullough and other historical documentation of the time, like the Constitution.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	A wonderful adult level animation for anyone 6 to 96.  A splendid historical romp!  Enjoy!  Pixar's done it again.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	A darker movie than even year 4 due to intrinsic story being dark in the first place. Also the director is differnt in this one and  here is not as operatic and gothic as in goblet of fire. The movie and book pretty much enter the xmen mode where you can sense this movie is the preparation for the big battle between the dumbledore army and the voldemort army in the next 2 books and movies. So its like a movie which sets the stage for a larger showdown. So although there is a showdown in the end, you know that this movie is a passage to the next and final one. The movie deviates from the end of the book and rightly so. The book did not have  dumbledore  returning for the final fight with Voldemort but in the movie he does return back. In the book he Vanishes when Cornelius Fudge attempts to arrest him to move him to Azkaban. The guys are all more grown up and look cooler. The costumes are nicer and chic. The movie is greyer and devoid of color than the previous films.<br /><br />regards, Vikram
B001OHS8BQ	3.0	b	"I think this movie would be good for any married couple regardless of their relationship.  Cameron has been in some other Christian movies before, most notably ""Left Behind.""  The acting isn't great, but the message is very good."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Jeff was my inspiration to get started and I'm so happy with my ""otto"" dummy and love to entertain!!!!!!!!!"
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Combine The Neverending Story, Xena, Legend, and Snow White and what do you get? This movie.!!!  So how could it fail?<br /><br />It's the tired tale of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and nothing was done to make it really interesting or fresh.<br /><br />The actress who played Snow White just didn't do a convincing job.<br /><br />The evil queen is barely in the movie, maybe less than ten minutes.  Snow White and the Huntsman?  The Huntsman didn't have a decent role in the movie.  There was just no magic to this one.  Bland, very bland.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"Sir Ridley Scott is classified as a ""visual director"" Blade Runner's visual effects rivals Prometheus. Althought Blade Runner wasn't socially accepted during its early years...later on it becomes a 'cult following' to a classic ending up on multiple 'best of list'. It looks to me that Prometheus will eventually win over its nay-sayers of even the ""Alien vs Predator"" fan club as well. Prometheus basically stands on its own...a beginning of 'things to come' - hopefully...that's yet to be determined by ""The Hollywood Universe"". This movie appears to be a first chapter of a new series...the orgins of Alien or even Blade Runner itself (well, I don't think Weyland & Tyrell Corp. have anything to do with each other). The unanswered questions of man's existance will(fingers crossed)be challenged in the next film(s)- It's good to see a film without the unnecessary ""loud effects"" & cheesey lines...great things come in forms of accidents not generic unrecyclable...stuff."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"I have been aware of Food, Inc. for some time, but watching it kept getting lost in the shuffle.  Now that I've finally watched it, I'm sorry that I let it get lost in the shuffle for so long.  Saying that it is one of the most important films you'll ever watch seems rather bombastic, but I'm serious about that claim.  I had already begun to change my buying habits at the grocery store and to begin to consider what I am putting my body and the bodies of my children, and this film made me more convinced than ever that this is not only the right thing to do, but also the only responsible thing to do.<br /><br />What was really telling for me was how the major corporations that were examined (Tyson's, Monsanto, etc.) refused to comment on the film.  When we walk into a U.S. grocery store, we have certain expectations about the quality of our foods.  When a film like this starts to poke holes into those illusions, and the major corporations concerned with these products refuse to comment, what should we, as consumers, think of their lack of response?  The current climate in the U.S. has shown us what happens when capitalism is allowed to run amok, when the dollar becomes more important than the person who is holding it.  It's not overstating things to say that what's going on in the food industry right now is every bit as alarming as what was going on in our financial institutions.<br /><br />I think what this film best illustrates is how our politicians (on both sides of the aisle), our government, and the heads of the departments we've entrusted to ensure our safety (USDA, FDA, et al.) have routinely sold us out for the sake of the almighty dollar.  The production of food has become so industrialized in this nation that the focus has shifted from ensuring safety to turning a blind eye in order to ensure the continued padding of the bottom line.  If Upton Sinclair could see what's going on today, he would despair over how we've learned nothing from his groundbreaking work, ""The Jungle"".<br /><br />My one issue with this film is its delicate handling of the new organic food industry.  I have switched to buying mostly organic foods, but I often wonder if this really is the solution to the problem, as it claims to be.  As these large organic companies (Stonyfield Farm, anyone?) start to grow to conglomerate status, do we run the risk of finding ourselves right back at square one?  I think the producers should have considered taking a harder look at these companies as well.<br /><br />Still, this is a film that is essential.  If Americans do not stand up and demand to know where their food comes from, demand to know why current practices are accepted, we all run the risk of a public health disaster.  This may sound dramatic, but one need only look at the rampant e. coli outbreaks to see that the proof is literally in the pudding.  We have grown far, far too complacent about the things we put into our mouths, trusting to regulatory agencies that are no longer operating under the mandate of ensuring public safety.<br /><br />The best lesson anyone can take from this film is that each and every one of us has the power.  Yes, these are huge corporations that command legions of lawyers and billions of dollars in profits, but where do those profits come from?  If we vote with our wallets, if we refuse to accept the presence of cloned meat and bio-engineered corn products in our foods, these companies will have no choice but to stand up and take notice.  We all need to go to the grocery store, pick up a container, read the ingredients, and walk away from anything that has unnatural ingredients in it. In this way, we can all become agents for the changes we want to see effected."
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	I have not seen this movie and thought about buying it ? What is with this movie being 4 to 5 dollars more than a normal new release ? Is George Lucas worried about gas prices or the economy ? Did this movie not make enough money already at the movie theater ? Are they trying to make up for the computer made Star Wars movie that flopped ?
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	I didn't know a lot about Iron Man but I like action/adventure movies and decided to give it a try.  It totally blew me away.  The special effects were awesome and the plot was great.  Robert Downing Jr. was an excellent Tony Stark and I loved Gwenneth Paltrow's character.  All the acting was excellent and I'm really happy I bought this movie.  I'm really looking forward to the next one.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Jeff is a genius. This is one of the funniest videos I've ever seen. We have watched it with dozens of friends, each one saying the same thing. You soon forget he is working with puppets and he is making all the sounds. There are even times when he and the puppets are talking at the same time! The puppets seem so real. It's amazing what he can say and get away with because it's coming out of their mouths. My husband and I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good laugh--a ""slap your knee, good belly laugh."""
B0006989TE	4.0	b	The Village Is A MUST SEE! It is well crafted, well acted, and best of all scary! The movie has also a very shocking ending! The ending was so shocking that I actually couldn't breath for a moment! Really! The Village is a masterpiece it should be nominated for some kind of award it is outstanding! Some people may not like the ending but i did! The ending was so orginal! This is not Night's Best Film, I think Signs is. However, I think this is way better than The Sixth Sense!
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"Now that the dust has settled the subtle insights can be seen. The speculation is rife with the theory that Shyamalan in The Village has made the same point Michael Moore made in Fahrenheit 9/11. The point being made is that when people are afraid you can control them easier. The Village says ""Those we don't speak of"" are the ""enemy"" and we must look out for them. We will ""alert"" the rest when they are sighted because that is when ""terror"" is near.<br /><br />Fear of the other side, fear of the unknown, fear of an enemy, real or imagined are useful to ""those who know"". If you use fear cleverly you can shunt people's independent thought process for either personal gain, or cementing your own insecurities. The Village elders were not bent on power but on protecting their families from experiencing human cruelty. They didn't succeed did they?<br /><br />There are some subtle messages, which Shyamalan delivers through The Village.<br /><br />Regardless of all good intentions, when fear is used as a weapon to constantly beat someone into submission you destroy his human spirit.<br /><br />You cannot escape the inevitability of human suffering no matter how far you run or how deep you bury your head in the sand."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"first off I am now 16 but started off at 15 my fittness journey started off about a year ago in my weight training class i took in school I weighed about 180 at 5'9 and I was ready to loose weight then after one semester of that class I had lost some weight not sure exactly. then I started going to the gym with my dad and my friend. We went to the gym for about 3 months. The gym started taking up too much time with driving there and working for a hour to an hour and a half at a time and then driving back it took around 2 hours and with school work and my 10th grade chemistry class I could not waste 2 hours a day and I ended up not getting enough sleep most nights or not having any free time during the day. So we stopped going to the gym for about a month.<br /><br />Then I herd about insanity. my sister of all people told me about it i am not sure how she found out about it but I looked in to it on amazon and sure enough it looked like the program for me. The initial hook for me was that the program only took 2 mouths and that seemed great. Right now I can say I am in the best shape of my life. I am 5""11 and 157 pound and my bmi is 23 which according to wii fit is a healthy range! and I have never been in the healthy range on wii fit and that is why this program was worth it. I still do not look like I have a beach body and I can not see my abs unless i flex them but there is not very much definition in them and I still have flab on my man boobs but according to my doctor is normal for teenage boys. I feel that The reason I do not have an abercrombie model body is because I did not follow the nutrition guide I am a very picky eater and I do not eat meat of any kind. I felt like I ate pretty healthy I did not eat crap and junk food but I was not eating pretty much any thing out of the nutrition guide.<br /><br />Enough of me rambling. Overall the program is very hard lots of cardio and its great for people who want to loose weight most of the work out are about 45 min in month 1 and in month 2 most are around an hour. every work out is cardio its hard and grueling but it will make you sweat I sweated my brains out every single work out that was not a recovery workout. It is worth it at the end of the 2 months. I would go for a second round of insanity but I am one week in to p90x now and once I finish p90x I will do a p90x and insanity hybrid then after that insanity asylum? p90x 2? p90x plus? or all of the above. over all I love working out at home because you dont have to wear a shirt and not feel insecure its great!!!"
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	Some reviews said this movie makes you THINK? REALLY! Because its my opinion the crew of the Prometheus would of died from their own stupidity even if they had not encountered the alien. The alien seemed to be the only one in the movie that knew what it was doing.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	A lot has changed in the wizarding world during the summer between Harry's fourth and fifth years at Hogwarts. Voldemort is back, but not in the open, and the ministry is ignoring it. The Minister of Magic feels threatened by Dumbledore and Potter and has been exerting control over the wizarding press to make it seem like they are both insane liars. This somber turn of events allows Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to discuss deeper topics than in previous Harry Potter installments; topics like government corruption and control, freedom of the press, corporal punishment, etc. The film also examines public responsibility in the midst of totalitarian government through the lens of Harry, Hermoine, and Ron's underground Defense of the Dark Arts class known as Dumbledore's Army. Hefty material for a series most people look at as children's fantasy fiction, huh?<br /><br />Teens approaching Harry Potter's age already deal with issues of rebellion and angst, but in times as hard as those facing Harry in Phoenix, those feelings are heightened. When I first read the book I thought that Harry was being a bit of a brat throughout this installment, but now I realize is the magnitude of what he was dealing with. He saw the most dangerous wizard of all time rise from a place between death and life and watched him murder a fellow classmate, yet no one believes him when he recounts this information.  Dumbledore, Harry's mentor and father figure, seems to completely ignore him, and the government interferes with the dealings of Hogwarts, the one place Harry holds sacred. Radcliffe does a great job at giving life to Harry's turmoil during this installment, and it seems that the entire youthful cast is continuously growing as actors. I'm sure working with several directors and brilliant veteran actors helped them through the process.<br /><br />Once again, a new director takes over the reigns of the series in Phoenix. The choice of David Yates as the fourth and final director of the series was kind of a surprise. Prior to Order of the Phoenix Yates had only directed television movies, so many people were unsure about this somewhat untested talent. There was no need to worry in my opinion. Not only did Yates make one of the best movies of the series, he also turned the longest Harry Potter book into the shortest movie without making it feel rushed or leaving any plot holes.<br /><br />Mostly featuring returning cast members that were basically absent for an installment (Gary Oldman has a much bigger part, and David Thewlis is back after being absent from Goblet of Fire), Order of the Phoenix doesn't contain very many new characters, but the few that are there represent quite a coup d'etat in casting. Finding newcomer Evanna Lynch for the role of Luna Lovegood was a brilliant feat in and of itself, and the role of Professor Umbridge is brilliantly played by Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton (Vera Drake, Freedom Writers), who brings Umbridge's toad-like qualities to life. Also joining the cast is the always marvelous Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club, Hamlet) as the evil Bellatrix Lestrange.<br /><br />I find this film to be better than Goblet of Fire, but it's still not without its failings. Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore still doesn't match up to J.K. Rowling's description of the character. While better than he was in the previous film, Gambon's Dumbledore still  doesn't create an impression of being the greatest wizard alive. I was also disappointed that certain details concerning the prophecy didn't make it into the film. In the book, you learn that the prophecy didn't explicitly mean that Harry would be Voldemort's enemy, but that it could have applied to another student at Hogwarts. It's not central to the plot, but I felt this was an interesting fact that viewers of the movie who haven't read the books missed out on.<br /><br />Critically, Order of the Phoenix is at the low end of the Potter films, tied for last place with Philosopher's Stone. At the box office, it continued the rise in box office receipts started with Goblet of Fire, surpassing it to become the second- highest grossing film of the series and of the year, with $938.2 million grossed worldwide. As this occurred with a summer release, those who thought that Prisoner of Azkaban grossed lower due to the release date were proven wrong. Of course, with its shorter run time and what is arguably the most brilliant scene of the series, Order of the Phoenix turned into quite the overall success.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Good movie ! The special effects were amazing!! Would recommend to others!  However, not for young children as it will probably scare them too much! Arrive in timely manner!
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	"As someone who was an adult when RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was released, I don't have the problem with this film that many of the ""haters"" have. It's certainly better on the whole than LAST CRUSADE was, which suffered from a lackluster first half, in my opinion. KOTCS is a fun romp through Eisenhower-era America, as Indy tracks down the truth behind the legend of ""ancient astronauts."""
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	Sorry I really love the Cohen brother films (Raising Arazona, the Big Lawbowski, Hudsucker Proxzy, Oh brother, et all) but this is utter rubbish, no story no reall connection to the characters, making the assasin like superman invunerable and a better detective than all that have gone before, somehow tracking the main character (or the follow up assasin) down without any evidence or link to them but sheer amazing luck or should that be magic, (even breaking into the assasin HQ, even though he was a marked man and no guards with no trouble) luck or sorry are we suppose to believe in magic. what utter bollocks.  Plus making Tommy Lee jones character pointless what a waste of 2 hours of my life I will never get back.  I hope that the Cohens start making real films again than the crap that this was.  Very disapointed and any muppet could have made.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	this was a excellent dvd..i am very happy with ordering from amazon..i like not having to do the waiting thing for movies and i will buy more from amazon..thanks so much..
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This is one of the most beautiful , wondrous, inspiring and lovely movies to come along in quite some time--and a movie that ALL AGES will enjoy to boot!<br /><br />The color palette is awesome--Vivid colors and activity--state of the art TGI animation--the irises of the eye are completely realistic on the close-ups. The book really comes to life.  Incredible!<br /><br />This movie is a lovely tale of several children, who aren't quite sure they believe in Santa anymore. They make a trip to the North pole that is a magical and wonderful adventure.  They learn friendship, love, leadership and belief along the journey.  The last several lines of the movie says it all.  I won't spoil the mood of the movie by telling you those lines.<br /><br />My heart was touched, inspired, filled with happiness, etc. by the end of this movie.  My children, ages 12 to 28, also LOVED it.  It is destined to become a modern classic!! Truly a delight for ALL--no matter what your age....and shouldn't be missed by any age.  Take grandma, grandpa, kids, teens, young adults and yourselves...and enjoy this special Holiday treat!!!  GO SEE THIS INCREDIBLE MOVIE--THE POLAR EXPRESS!!!

B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	This was my favorite of the series. a lot was left out as usual but it was still worth watching. If you've haven't read the book get ready for an awesome movie!!!!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I had to take the books out of my house, because the impulse to read them repeatedly was becoming a huge time suck. I love the first season, the best thing is, instead of making the characters less interesting through the television medium, the characters come to life as the story develops in a parallel time line. Compared to the books, which are all from Sookie's perspective and the reader discovers everything when she does. Extra bonus: I can do other stuff while I watch the DVDs.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	An excellent and interesting story about the beginnings of a new nation from the point of view of John Adams, the second president of the United states of America. Shows that the first presidents of the nation were flesh and blood, human like everybody else and not just statues on pedestals...
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is by far the funniest DVD by far... I have enjoyed his shows before and was not disappointed... I loved it so much I purchased 3 more as gifts for friends and family for christmas...
B0032CNOK6	3.0	b	I refuse to recommend this movie, and i refuse to tell you not to see it. its good whenver anyone makes a movie presenting a viewpoint and the very essense of the movie again makes you understand this this too is an exercise in free speech. I turned this off 27 minutes into the movie because i had had enough by then. so take it for what its worth.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Leave it to Alan Ball to put a new kind of spin on an old theme.  The Six Feet Under creator and American beauty writer adapted Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Series of Sookie Stackhouse novels with spectacular results with True Blood; which presents to us a world in which vampires not only exist, but are public knowledge.  Since I've never read any of the novels, I can't vouch for how faithful True Blood is to the source material, but what I can say is that Ball and co. have crafted a believable take on a tired theme.  Anna Paquin (X-Men, The Piano) plays Sookie: a Louisiana barmaid who just so happens to be able to read people's minds, a trick which both comes in handy and gives her a good share of headaches to boot.  Soon enough, her interest is piqued in Bill (Stephen Moyer), a 137 year old vampire with whom sparks start flying, much to the dismay of her dim-witted sex-addict brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten), her best friend Tara (Rutina Wesley), and her boss Sam (Sam Trammell) who has a few secrets of his own.  Oh yeah, there's also a serial killer running rampant targeting girls who have been with vamps, and soon enough has Sookie targeted as well.  With plenty of twists, turns, standout performances, and an undeniably sexy atmosphere to boot; True Blood makes for one of HBO's most addicting shows in quite some time.  Vets from other HBO shows are abound as well, including William Sanderson (Deadwood) and Chris Bauer (The Wire) as two investigating cops, as well as Lois Smoith as Sookie and Jason's nurturing grandmother.  All in all, even if you aren't a fan of vampire lore, give True Blood a chance, and you'll be quite surprised by what you find here.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"It isn't surprising that so many Darwinian fundamentalist fanatics here attempt to debunk this film as lies and trash etc.<br /><br />The funniest thing about that is, that in doing so, they are proving to the rest of us that the film's content is correct.<br /><br />Darwinism (or neo-Darwinism for you nit-pickers) is the opium of the materialist/atheist with no ability to face his insecurities towards the evidence of design in the universe and the logical implications thereof.<br /><br />In the words of atheist zoologist S.J. Gould, ""The scientific establishment bears a grisly resemblance to the Spanish Inquisition. Either you accept the rules and attitudes and beliefs promulgated by the 'papacy' (for which read, perhaps, the Royal Society or the Royal College of Physicians), or face a dreadful retribution. We will not actually burn you at the stake, because that sanction, unhappily, is now no longer available under our milksop laws. But we will make damned sure that you are a dead duck in our trade."" (Gould, D.W., ""Letting poetry loose in the laboratory,"" New Scientist, 29 August 1992, p.51)<br /><br />The film shows that this is especially true where Darwinism is concerned. While Gould clearly admits the fact his followers strangely cannot.<br /><br />Sir F. Hoyle saw the situation the same way, ""Because the old believers said that God came out of the sky, thereby connecting the Earth with events outside it, the new believers were obliged to say the opposite and to do so, as always, with intense conviction. Although the new believers had not a particle of evidence to support their statements on the matter, they asserted that the rabbit producing sludge (called soup to make it sound more palatable) was terrestrially located and that all chemical and biochemical transmogrifications of the sludge were terrestrially inspired. Because there was not a particle of evidence to support this view, new believers had to swallow it as an article of faith, otherwise they could not pass their examinations or secure a job or avoid the ridicule of their colleagues. So it came about from 1860 onward that new believers became in a sense mentally ill, or, more precisely, either you became mentally ill or you quitted the subject of biology, as I had done in my early teens. The trouble for young biologists was that, with everyone around them ill, it became impossible for them to think they were well unless they were ill, which again is a situation you can read all about in the columns of Nature."" (Hoyle, F., ""Mathematics of Evolution,"" [1987], Acorn Enterprises: Memphis TN, 1999, pp.3-4).<br /><br />Indeed, pass exams, secure a job and avoid ridicule.  All that we know is happening in current Western & European academia and that the film Expelled so easily and accurately demonstrates.  I would add, from my own experiences - the half has never yet been told.<br /><br />Buy this DVD. If it doesn't open your eyes maybe it's because you just do not want to see."
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"I understand people who approached ""The Village"" with dispositions based on the previews, but the story was incredible.  While some of the finer aspects were lacking (acting, cinematography...) the storyline was remarkable.  How M. Night is still capable of creating these stories is beyond me.  Initially the film starts out as stupid.  The entire notion of a village secluded and hiding from scary monsters who prey on the color red is absurd, but after the ""big secret"" is revealed how can one still claim the film was bad?  I enjoyed it.  I must not conclude without mentioning the score.  James Newton Howard's music and Hillary Hahn's innocent and haunting violin were astounding.  If you didn't like the movie, you must have at least enjoyed the score."
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"I'm always one to admire artistic expression and originality, but I think that looking at the big picture is the best way to evaluate the quality of a movie.<br /><br />BIG PICTURE QUESTION NUMBER 1: Was this movie entertaining?<br /><br />Yes and no. Mostly NO. It seemed to take itself too seriously, and while a few scenes were well acted and appropriate in length, other dragged on. It often seemed like the characters were speaking in slow motion. Similarly, characters (with the exception of the two sisters and the crazy/retarded wacko guy) came off as stoic and inhibited to the point of being silly.<br /><br />BIG PICUTRE QUESTION NUMBER 2: What was the ""squirm in the seat"" factor, on a scale of 0 (enthralled) to 10 (thank God it's a DVD so that I can go reorganize my sock drawer and just keep it on for noise)?<br /><br />8. Interesting story line/concept, but enough with the slo-mo talk and stare scenes and the stupid dialogue that is so often emotionless and vague, and takes itself ever so seriously.<br /><br />BIG PICTURE QUESTION 3: Would I want to watch this movie again or recommend it to friends?<br /><br />No."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"We have seen this movie three times already. First, we enjoyed it by ourselves; then, with friends and finally with the family.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays the lead role of this superhero story. Tony Stark is a brilliant individual who graduates from MIT at an early age and goes on to design many of the weapons sold by the company his father founded.<br /><br />The movie immediately hooked us for we see Stark visiting the Middle East, delivering weapons and demonstrating the power behind his designs. The pace is amazing as we confront terrorists who to Stark's horror and dismay; use the very weapons he designed for our protection as the tools of mass destruction. How is this possible if he only sells to friends?<br /><br />Stark is captured and transforms into Iron Man by a suit he designs that makes him indestructible, with weapons to fight innumerable enemies and able to fly to safety.<br /><br />He escapes and comes back home where his assistant, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, is waiting for him at the airport. It is fun to watch Stark tell her ""the vacation is over"" and that the first thing he MUST do is eat a cheeseburger. Burger King must have paid a fortune for this ad.<br /><br />The technology used in this movie is razor edge, his ability to design in a three dimensional environment is simply awesome. As usual, the bad guys interfere at every turn and he discovers that the force behind his many encounters with challenges is in the identity of which he thought was a close ""friend.""<br /><br />This movie provided adventure, romance, intrigue and comedy. We have seen it three times and something tells me we shall soon want to see it again, therefore, we highly recommend purchasing as opposed to going to the movies or renting it. Don't miss it... it is AWESOME!!!"
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I have every Harry potter movie that was made.  I am so sorry to see that this is near the end.  I also purchased one for my mother.  She told me that I also must get her Part 2.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	To me, Jeff Dunham is one of the greatest stand up comediants there are, and this show is a testimony to his genius. He not only has many jokes in his repertoire, but the way he delivers them, with the aid of his puppets, which he brings to life, to the point you forget they are nothing but dolls and start thinking about them as real and alive as Jeff himself.<br />Furthermore, the seller was able to deliver it inside the time frame provided at the time of the purchase.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	next to the Batman film (Dark Knight), Iron Man was by far the most enjoyable action film of summer '08.  Great cast, great script, interesting CGI, well-acted and directed.  I actually had FUN watching this in the theater.  The action scenes with Iron Man in flight were awesome.<br /><br />Downey Jr. adds just the right touch of humor/anger in the role, and Paltrow has never looked more beautiful.<br /><br />I've heard the sequel comes out May 2010....I'll be the first one in line.
B002VRZEYM	2.0	b	I didn't hear too much in this documentary. It was obviously biased without actually giving a clue as to what their motive was. They tried to make a point very unconvincingly.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	Hey, I liked it. I can say all the negative stuff but it was good to see the man in the hat back up on the big screen again. I've watched this movie 3-5 five times since i got the dvd and i thoroughly enjoy it. It's got aspects of all the movies wrapped up in one. Heck, it even mentions an event from the Young Indiana Jone's TV show. It also brings more depth into the character of Indiana Jones and the whole meaning of his life.<br />I can say, though, that he only uses his whip three times (twice is in the very beginning, and once at the end to toss to mac)which is the least he ever used it in any of the other ones. Some more whip swinging and snapping and booby traps would have added more to the feature. But I still enjoyed it nonetheless.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	I really enjoyed this movie. If u have ever watched the Disney version of Snow White as a child, well, this is the grown up version.<br /><br />The movie, very much sticks to the fairy tale classic. I honestly cant figure out why others have given it such bad reviews. Perhaps they are reality tv show fans?  This movie, is a very solid fairy tale, and, the characters are cast quite well.<br /><br />2 hours, of amazing effects, good story, and, great cast, held my interest easliy.<br /><br />I went into watching this movie, prior to tho, expecting to see a story about Snow White. Guess what I got?  A story about Snow White!  Others, not so sure what they were expecting. ;)<br /><br />If any have aversions to fairy tales, maybe they should pass on this. I thought it was superb.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"Disclaimer:  This is really a preview of the movie, since I don't have the 3D blue-ray version in my possession at the time, but I definitely pre-ordered it!<br /><br />[Disclaimer 2:  Okay, months after I ordered and watched this movie, I suppose I should update my preview into a real review, huh?  Stuff in Brackets are new info, for the sake of preservation of the original preview.  -MT 05/22/09]<br /><br />For those who do not know, the Polar Express is based on a book by Caldecot Award winner Chris Van Allsburg of the same title (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618477977"">The Polar Express Gift Set</a>), a story told me about ten years ago.  Excellent book, btw, and you should consider buying it.<br /><br />When the movie came out, it was released as a regular movie, and then as a IMAX 3D movie.  The regular movie was well-received, but the 3D movie was very excellently received.  I've seen both, and I can tell you that the moving train scenes and the falling snow scenes being seen in 3D is already enough to see the 3D version exclusively.  In my opinion, seeing the 3D version and then seeing the 2D version is like watching a movie in color, and then seeing it again in only black and white.  It did so well that the movie was shown in many IMAX theaters during Christmas for another 2 years.<br /><br />Therefore, when the movie was first released in 2D only, I decided that I could not buy it, since to me, it was the stripped down version.  When I bought a PS3, I still did not buy the Blu-Ray version, since the higher resolution was an improvement, but without 3D, it still wasn't worth it.  Now, however, Warner Bros. is finally willing to release the movie in 3D and 3D Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Therefore, you have 4 versions (plus the full screen version, but that's definitely not under consideration):<br />2D low def (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AGTPUK"">The Polar Express (Widescreen Edition)</a>)<br />2D high def (Blu-Ray <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7ZO8U"">The Polar Express [Blu-ray</a>] and HD-DVD <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I2JKCO"">The Polar Express [HD DVD</a>])<br />3D low def (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q7ZO8U"">The Polar Express [Blu-ray</a>])<br />3D high-def Blu-Ray (this version, although it's also released in HD-DVD)<br />If you have a Blu-Ray player, you really need to buy this one.  If you are unlucky and do not, get the 3D low-def version.  If you somehow have a HD-DVD player, you're out of luck, sorry.<br /><br />Again, an excellent story, an excellent movie, and the 3D version is excellent.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended.<br /><br />[updated 05/22/09:  While I still highly recommend this version, I now have to caution you about the 3D effect.  Don't know if it's because of me (I use glasses, and unlike the theater experience, fitting the paper frame 3D glasses in front of or behind my regular glasses isn't as good as fitting the theater 3D glasses over them), but the 3D effect wasn't great for me.  Because home 3D uses tinting as opposed to theater which uses polarized glasses, the 3D image is a lot darker.  For movies like Spy Kids 3D (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000TG9ZG"">Spy Kids 3-D Game Over (Two-Disc Collector's Series)</a>), this darkening isn't so noticeable, but in The Polar Express, because you see so much white snow, the 3D effect makes the snow off-white, with the colors occassionally turning greenish or reddish if either side of your glasses/eye dominates temporarily.  There are also enough night scenes that the darkening effect makes those scenes hard to make out, and you basically waste your blu-ray definition.<br /><br />So, why do I still recommend this version?  Let's remember, this movie is still a great movie, still a great story, and the lack of technology makes this story relevant for years and decades to come.  And the resolution in the 2D version is still great, since it's still in blu-ray 1080P.  And the price difference between this one and the 2D blu-ray version is a buck or 2.  So, for this small difference in price, you get the option of 3D, without losing anything.  Yes, you can turn off 3D at the beginning, as well as swap between 2D and 3D in the middle of the movie.  And this will allow your kids (with presumably better eyesight), to experience the 3D version at least once.<br /><br />Oh, and a person asked in the comments section if this includes 3D glasses.  Yes, 4 pairs, with the paper frames.<br /><br />So, there you have it, my updated preview turned into an authentic review.  Perhaps with the imperfect 3D, I'll knock it down to 4.5 stars, so the rounded value remains 5 stars!  Yay!<br />-MT, 05/22/09]"
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	"Problem: When one speaks of ""beauty"", people tend to forget that ""beauty"" is both external and ""internal"". Perhaps Snow White's purity created her overall beauty. Charlize is one of those rare women who seem to ""glow"" with little or no effort. There was one movie, she played a roadside pro, (maybe ""Beast"") in love with another woman... they had to go to great lengths to make her (Charlize) look that bad. Beauty is not skin deep.<br />Perhaps Chalize's character realized that she did indeed, need both.<br /><br />Overall, anyone can pick at the little things ""that annoyed them"" about the film. And some insist on writng disertations. I wish people would only review the overall ""quality""of the entire movie. Don't spoil it for others who have not seen it, by critiquing nearly all of the important (or not) scenes.<br /><br />It was an adventure and it managed to pull the more important emotions from me. That and it's quality, overall, made for an entertaining film. I would heartily recommend it to any adult. Enough so, that I will add it to my movie library.<br />Opal"
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Iron Man has been a favorite of mine since childhood and they got this one right. Marvel's best superhero movie to date (yes Spider-Man fans!). 2008 saw 2 great superhero movies (Batman: The Dark Knight was probably the best movie in 2008) that did not disappoint.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. was marvelous. The 2 disc addition is the one to own.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	This film is one of the best translations of a comic book, with great attention paid to the atmospherics, that I have ever seen.  From the moment it starts, the viewer is treated to a succession of characters and their bizarre adventures, which appear disjointed and non-sensical, but vivid with unbelievable violence, sudden death, and what are revealed to be intriguing clues to a bigger picture that is never completely explained.  It is filmed for the most part in black and white, a wonderful evocation of film noir and gotham, with occasional colors thrown in for unusual characters like the yellow man, or simply for splurting blood.<br /><br />The acting is truly excellent, starting with Willis, who once again proves capable of delivering a quirky, funny character for whom you can suspend your disbelief.  He is a sick cop, trying to do some good one last time, leading to an awful adventure.  His ward, a lovely young girl who grows into  Jessica Alba, is a pawn in a larger game that is unclear.  Then there is Micky Rourke, an extremely ugly thug who is out for revenge and crazy but also, the viewer suspects, perhaps redeemable even if he tortures some victims to death.<br /><br />Recommended.  I will definitely watch this again.  There are many nuances and clues that will come together only with multiple viewings, a bigger picture that will emerge through interpretation.  That is far better fun than a single-watch passtime film.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	I just love movies that take you to another world, the acting was great, the storyline was spectacular, it was cool for me to see something different. Charlize therone was as evil as she can be, she is the highlight of the film. But i just loved the enchanted forest, the mushrooms&fairies, i can watch that all day.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	This movie is by far my favorite of the 5 thus filmed.  However, I was disappointed in the extras.  I wish I would have saved the money and just gotten the single disk widescreen version.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"This movie was horrible. A fan of the first three, I have decided this forth Indiana Jones film does not qualify as an addition to the classic trilogy.<br /><br />Why all major characters had to be introduced by being kidnapped, why there was a lack of any intriguing local characters and villains in the film, and why the ending was an incomprehensible disaster are beyond my understanding, but none-the-less a let down to my expectations. Add in three time-consuming car chases, some irrelevant and stereotypical character named ""Mac"", a shallow son named ""Mutt"", force Cate Blanchett to play the only talking (and completely unsophisticated) bad guy, and you have a pretty bad movie.<br /><br />I believe George Lucas once commented that after finishing what the public expected from him with his second Star Wars series, he felt entitled to make as many bad movies as he pleases. Here we go."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	I hardly ever watch the same movie twice in a row. But with this one I did. I had to. It was that mesmerizing.<br /><br />This movie could easily have grossed over $200M if it wasn't so bold in attacking the religious right and those in power.<br /><br />Sin City is where people regularly suffer oppression and injustice from those in power (priests, senators, and police). It is a story of those who choose to fight against their brutal oppressors.<br /><br />The protagaonists, although far from perfect and ideal, genuinely want to do good and right in a world where virtue is rare. Fighting back often means making the powerful suffer. It becomes a game of who can inflict the most pain on the other. Is such a world so far from the reality?<br /><br />The movie is bold in its search for the truth of the human heart. Will a man do anything for a woman who has given him her body and kindness when no one else has? Can a good cop overcome his irresistible attraction to a voluptuous 19 year old whom he has saved from rape only 8 years earlier?<br /><br />The protagonists and villians are highly unique. Mickey Rourke was extraordinary as Marv and deserves an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />I believe the footage of Jessica Alba doing a cowboy dance on stage will be studied as a cinematography masterpiece.<br /><br />This movie hits on all cylinders in its bold attempt to provoke thought and passion in its viewers.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Admittedly, this was my favorite film of the year in its original form.<br /><br />The Special Edition was worth the wait, and in my opinion, is worth buying even if you purchased the original.<br /><br />The second disc includes the film in a new version -- as three separate graphic novels (and one graphic short story) --fully capturing Frank Miller's incredible vision in glorious black and white (and red and yellow).  In a word, amazing.  I almost always find director's cuts to be a tiresome affair -- simply re-inserting scenes that were correctly cut the first time.  Not so.  Not one frame feels like filler.  Everything serves to deepen and enrich the amazing world of Basin City.<br /><br />I haven't made it through all of the new extras yet (on the second disc), but two are definitely worth noting.  The 15 minute Flic School (a staple of Rodriguez's special editions) is great and focuses on the process of shooting in the digital domain -- one surprise was learning that many of the actors who work together seamlessly in the film never actually met in person.  Ahh the magic of digital editing.<br /><br />The companion piece to the flic school is an all greenscreen version of the theatrical release.  That is -- Rodriguez takes only the raw footage of the film, without any special effects, de-colorization and in many cases, sets -- and speeds the whole thing up so you get to race through the film and see how they did it -- which sets were real, which ones weren't, etc.<br /><br />Truly incredible.<br /><br />This one gets my vote for DVD release of the year.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Either you like the Harry Potter books or you don't.  Sadly the movies leave out events in order to keep the story within a reasonable time.  Regardless, this latest one is great.  Looking forward to the last two.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I'm serious- this has become my favorite film of all time. It's not a kids movie. In fact, I can't believe there are people rating this so poorly. No matter what life throws at me or how I respond, I can always count on The Polar Express to remind me of what's real. Brilliant. PLEASE see it.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"If you are not a comicbook fan, if you are not into films that go ""over the top"", if you don't like characters that are larger-than-life, if you don't like unbelieveable visual treats, you will hate this movie! I, on the otherhand, am a sucker for the visual, comicbook obvious - Hence, 5-stars.<br /><br />The women are stunning (in more ways then one), the men are almost as ruthless and unforgiving as they are. Hey, it might be mindless, but this flick is entertaining to the point that I was disappointed it wasn't longer."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"The acting is amazing and the story will never be forgotten. Gritty but alluring. It makes us want to watch how two men that came from the streets of the city are drawn to the state police. We see they have very different ideas about crime even though they come from very similar backgrounds. The action is non-stop and will have some biting their nails as the tension mounts. One cop is dirty while the other pretends to be. Will the pretend criminal or dirty cop be found out? What will happen to them if they are? Superb cast, great sets and camera work, and decent music make it a must see for adults. Fans of cop movies like ""13th Precinct"", ""French Connection"", and ""Serpico"" won't want to miss it.<br /><br />This is one of the best dramas I have seen in years. Scorsese once again shows us what a master he is as a director. Nicholson, Damon, and DiCaprio deserved Oscars let alone nominations at he very least. Although Walberg is great as always, he is not on the screen all that much as the other three in this movie. I'm glad he got a nomination, but the other three were robbed. They make you feel their roles and pull you into this riveting story of how two kids from the streets grow up fighting to make it. Their lives are messy and they try to keep them together the best they can. The complexities of characters here makes for excellent acting. Don't miss this one. I recommend this for buying if you enjoy crime dramas."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I grew up about two miles from the Adams homestead and the Adams family history was a part of our lives.  I believe the movie is an outstanding depiction.  Loved every minute of it.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	Great action and effects, but the plot seemed all too familiar. . flesh eating bugs, collapsing pyramid, greedy friend getting left behind- I've seen this before!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham's DVD ""Spark Of Insanity"" was hilarious. He has two new characters and shows you the creative process that goes into making your own vent dummy from the first idea to last article of clothing. This is truly a one of a kind video. I will be on the look out for more products from this very talented individual."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Just when you thought ventriloquism was gone.Here comes Jeff Dunham. WOW!!!! this guy and his characters are among the best. A MUST SEE! but, Not for children.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	"There are literally hundreds of reviews of this DVD release on Amazon, so I'm sure this review will not make a lot of difference but, after spending over two hours watching the film - and some time with the - FIVE HOURS of bonus features (much rehashing why the film is a ""Classic"") - I'm left with many visual impressions (mostly those of Javier Bardem's face). But that is it. Once you start watching this film, you can't leave your seat; you are drawn in, waiting for the next move. But the ending is quick. Didn't Bob Newhart do this on TV. Were the last two hours a memory? Who's to decide? The Coen Brothers certainly won't tell you. They are wonderfully quirky. I loved their early films like ""Blood Simple"" because they were small and oddball. And ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" was a a musical masterpiece. But Oscar worthy as Best Picture? I can't agree.<br /><br />Just as importantly is the graphic violence. Sure ""Saving Private Ryan"" had it and won Best Picture. To be honest, I've only watched the second part of that film as the graphic violence was too much for me. The point could easily be made in less time. We saw these scenes on TV in the late 60s from the Vietnam War - but TV no longer shows the violence in Iraq on the nightly news.<br /><br />When a film is honored like ""No Country"" it attracts attention and teens and young adults will go to see it - or rent it. Unless I missed something in this film, violence is condoned and accepted as natural. How many impressionable young (or even old) people will go out and get one of those ""air guns"" - or whatever they are called - that Bardem uses to break into room or kill people. Do you need a license for those? The Coens have always used violence but it was comic book violence with humor. I saw no humor here and the quality of the production - from great scenic photography to great acting - put this in a class well above the Rambo and ""Die Hard"" action pictures.<br /><br />It seems no one is ""middle of the road"" when it comes to loving or hating this film. And that's okay. But my only comment is that before you watch it you should be prepared for graphic violence equal to modern war films and use that as a guide when watching it with your children. Believe me, I don't believe in censorship, just awareness of the contents of films.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />""Anything Phonographic"""
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"I really wanted to like this movie, but I just didn't.  It does ""sort of"" answer questions, just not in any novel or unexpected way, and I would have preferred a plot and some character development over the very pretty special effects clearly set up for a 3D release.  I watched it after a Quadrilogy marathon along with ""Planet of the Vampires,""  in which was Scott's inspiration for the alien ship, and which made it suffer by comparison, I think, which is saying a lot since Planet of the Vampires is a seriously ""B"" movie. This is Ridley Scott and HR Giger.  I expected so much more and was disappointed and sorry I'd bought it for my Alien collection, instead of just renting it.  Less effects and better art direction for mood and atmosphere might have saved it from no-plot, no character development land, but there was very little to none of either.  Perhaps Scott will release Prometheus Redemption with these elements, but I won't be rooked into buying it.  At least when you ""have to buy The White Album, again"" you know The White Album is really good. Rent it, if you must, before you add it to your Alien collection.  Perhaps they should have hired Pinback to write the screenplay."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Order and delivery were handled quickly and efficiently .  DVD's were in perfect condition and all materials were included.  Have been using the product for several weeks and seen no issues.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	The movie in bluray is awesome. I loved the box. Is everything so beatiful. I'm almost finishing my ultimates colection.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I found the DVD to be so entertaining that I am using it as a ""thank you"" for friends and business associates. I have one very good friend who is having a terrable time coping with his ""Cancer"" I sent him the DVD and it  cheered him up if only temporarily. I expect to be ordering more of this DVD for special friends and occasions in the future.<br />Im over 70 and don't get to see these types of comedy or movies very often, so my endorsement probably doesn't mean very much, but those I have sent to friends have really been appreciated."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"""You don't make up for your sins in Church; you do it on the street; everything else is __________ and you know it""<br />- from MEAN STREETS (1973) directed by Martin Scorsese<br /><br />  Of all sins - deception proves the most elusive of absolution; for it is through lies and lying that Satan seeks man's ruination. Such is the world of former- seminary-student-turned-film director Martin Scorsese- who has been setting morality fables in brutal urban streets for almost 40 years.<br /><br />  Violent, profane, rife with obsidian-black humor and, as with all Scorsese pictures, set to a soundtrack of classic rock music THE DEPARTED is filled with countless deceitful, plague-carrying rats (both literal and figurative).<br /><br />  Through Scorsese's lens, no one is completely innocent. All characters carry the guilt of mendacity and all must serve a penance. For most this includes blood atonement.<br /><br />  THE DEPARTED, Scorsese's latest meditation on the nature of sin and sinning, unfolds in the rotting bureaus of Irish South Boston and depicts two spies (artists of deception) one working for the police, another working for the mob.<br /><br />  Employing long, sweeping steadicam as well as tracking and crane shots Scorsese's camera bottles lightening with an expert cast working at the top of their collective games. Playing alongside wily veterans Martin Sheen and Alex Baldwin, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg all deliver some of their finest, most nuanced work.<br /><br />  Jack Nicholson, playing a graying and wrinkled Satan chews the scenery complete with an authentic ""Southie"" accent. Save for couple of scenes in which he gives a grotesque- pain inducing self-parodic imitation of himself, Nicholson reminds us he is one of America's artistic treasures.<br /><br />  And so is director Martin Scorsese, who after stepping away from his comfort zone, returns to his greatest strength- telling contemporary stories about sinners paying for their sins on the streets."
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	This movie is just regurgitated garbage from Speilberg and Lucas. It like its lead actor is a tire old worn out mess. And what do they do to spruce up this old hag of a movie? Why they throw in a young sidekick! And who better than to play it but Mrs. Speilberg herself Shia 'I am not really good looking, not really talented, and not really anything special... except to Stephen) Lebeouf! Yipeee!<br /><br />Save your money and rent 1 or 3 and if you want to prove how bad this pile of dung is watch 2 it is even better than this.<br /><br />Harrison Ford? Retire please. You are worn out and  you haven't done anything origional or even good in years. Lucas? Keep sitting on  your big pile of money and keep producing the same two movies over and over and over. Speilberg? Take your girlfriend and get on Death Star and go to Dantooeen forever. This movie is a bloated old worn out mess.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I had no idea about where my food came from or why it mattered before watching this. Very educational and entertaining.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	The Departed is a great movie, In my opinion better then Goodfellas. It looks awesome In HD. Reccomend this for anyone who has HD, even if you already own The Departed its worth getting again just for the HD and extras.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Wasn't into comic books when growing up, but would consider now.  Movie plot was great and special effects even better. Excellent quality video production.  Highly recommend
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	I was interested in this movie because I liked the idea and was open to the story. The beginning was good, but then it just dragged as soon as the Kristin Stewart part strengthened. The Dwarfs were great and there were parts when Kristin was good, but I wondered when she cried how they got that effect. Her range of emotion is so limited. The Chris Hemsworth character was also limited and almost appeared to be a caricature.<br /><br />I believe that some of the blame should be with the director who seemed to be more focused on Kristen than on making a good movie. Thank goodness Charlize was in it! She was so believably evil and acted so well. She was just great. Most of the special effects were also centered on Charlize and where good. But the story was just predictable and where it could have been interesting in the relationship of the characters, it just was boring. The only good parts were the scenes when Charlize was doing her evil bit and trying to kill snow white.<br /><br />A disappointment and waste of time!
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	This is an excellent action adventure film. First, I liked the decision to use an older Indiana Jones and stick with Harrison Ford with a story that takes place during the Cold War while Ike was President. I thought the story was well written and a strong cast was assembled. While I certainly missed Sean Conner and Denholm Elliot, this story takes place nearly twenty years later and the enemy has changed from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union. The film acknowledges their passing and the arrival of a new age which constantly keeps our head spinning with reasons for hope and despair. The FBI even suspects the loyalty of Indiana Jones to the amazement of his colleagues. Yet to the amazement of Jones he is betrayed by an old wartime friend! How does the Dean put it? We seem to be entering a period of life where more is taken from us than given to us.<br /><br />The film truly seems rather downbeat at the railroad station until the arrival of Mutt on his bike with a plea for help from an old friend. Rather than remaining dejected Jones listens to the young man, who he later learns is his son, about the trouble that another old friend, Oxley, has gotten his mother who he later learns is a past lover, Marien Ravenwood from the first film. Indiana Jones isn't the beaten man filled with despair at the railroad station but somebody with hope for tomorrow at the end of the film.<br /><br />Even if the heroine role had been saved for Karen Allen, Cate Blanchett was superb as Dr.Irina Spalko. She made the show run with her pursuit of the Crystal Skull from the opening scene to the final one at the temple. Ray Winstone,the wartime buddy, who betrays Jones, puts in a fine job as Mack. She also receives some fine support from Igor Jijikine as Colonel Antonin Dovchenko. Communist ideology would not permit the pursuit of any religious artifact but evidence of an ET might prove attractive and remember the space race was just beginning.<br /><br />Karen Allen played Marien Ravenwood and starred in the first film with a romantic final scene between Jones and herself. Whatever happened to it? When she makes her first appearance Jones is shocked when he learns Mutt is her son. Earlier in the film he only introduced himself and his mother as friends of Dr. Oxley, played by John Hurt  Another key supporting actor was Shia LaBeouf who played Mutt. Marien only told Jones that he was the father when it appeared that they were going to die.<br /><br />The Crystal Skull is first and foremost an adventure but it also becomes an opportunity for reconciliation between Jones and his past for a brighter future. Like Jones in The Last Crusade, Mutt gets an opportunity to work with his father and learn all about him. Marien remembers the man she fell in love with. He renews a friendship with Oxley (John Hurt)and returns to college in a new position as an Associate Dean and married to Marien Ravenwood.<br /><br />Another thing that I liked about The Crystal Skull was the consistent pace of the story. It never stalls. So time quickly passes. The first and second films stalled on occasion, the third film slowly started but quickly finished. The only mediocre film was The Temple of Doom. The two best films were The Last Crusade and The Crystal Skull.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"""Sin City"" is brilliant and beautiful looking! The all-star cast headlined by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, and Jessica Alba, are impressive. The directing by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller and special guest director Quentin Tarantino is brilliant. The visuals are astounding and brilliant. The music by Rodriguez, John Debney, and Graeme Revell, is impressive. This is a film that is different and unique from all other movies. It has a sight ""Pulp Fiction"" feel to it. This is one of the best pictures of the year!"
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Unbelievable.<br />  How can anyone say that this film was trash. This was Indiana Jones<br />pure and simple. The movie was fantastic because it was entertaining. I can understand people having certain issues as far as it being too far fetched but even that is an unvalid excuse. All of the Indiana Jones films have been extremely over the top. I have been reading so many negative reviews and it just doesn't make any sense. What does everyone expect it to be. Lets see you try to make a film of this caliber. Maybe it would turn out little bit better but it would never be perfect because no movie in history is or ever will be perfect. In my honest opinion I think that a lot of people are panning this movie due to all of the negative problems going on in our world right now ( example: gas prices, the war and our economy ). I just think that there is an extreme amount of pecimissim in our society at this point and they need something to bash on. People are going into the theater to watch this movie all ready full of negativity. I really liked and enjoyed this movie and I am having a really hard time believing that there is a moderate amount of people out there saying that this latest installment is garbage. Please dont get me wrong I am not implying that everyone isn't intitled to their own opinion. I think once again a lot of people went into this wonderful film with an unrealistic anticipation. Of course this installment was going to be different. It is no longer the 1980's. Filming has changed and evolved in many ways since then so it's going to look and feel a little different. My 18 year old stepson watched the movie with me. He has seen all of the Indiana Jones movies and he told me that KOTCS was by far his favorite out of all of them. Just had to get that off my chest.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Acting was good however the story line lacked action and substance, if I had seen it, I would not have purchased it.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"Long story short: this movie sucks. If you liked the original Indiana Jones movies, you will only want to say horrible curse words after watching this film.<br /><br />(WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW. Although unless you are a moron or beneath the age of 3, most of these ""plot points"" will become apparent within the first 10 minutes.)<br /><br />I got to see a late-night showing of this movie, and I was psyched. I happen to adore the first three movies, which are breathtaking joyrides full of adventure, fabulous characters, and exotic locales. Unfortunately, this movie is their retarded younger brother, who is no doubt a drug addict.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />Yes, it's entertaining... sometimes. It features some sweet fight and chase scenes, hilarious dialogue, and some nice slapstick, but the plot? The subject? The characters themselves? My sister hit the mark when she said, ""Well, maybe it's because they're making movies for our Stupid Generation. They don't want to spend a lot of time on character development because all people care about are explosions and fight scenes.""<br /><br />Which also made me wonder: has anyone in charge of that movie, you know, SEEN the prior movies lately? And I mean watched them and really let themselves get into it. They got the entire mood of Indy 4 completely wrong... and here's why, in detail:<br /><br />THE VERY UGLY<br />CG and Sets<br />What happened to the locales? Whereas in the old Indy movies you felt like you were in the nitty gritty underbelly of foreign societies, getting filthy, going to real exotic countries... in this movie everything looked prepackaged, too perfect, compact, and felt like movie sets from the first moment you laid eyes on them. There's no ""feeling"" for any place the characters visit. Remember when Indy went to Cairo in the first movie, and they pan this fabulous shot over all the rooftops? You felt like there was boundless adventure waiting somewhere out there, and the location felt REAL. But each place in Indy 4 feels like a level in a video game; there are walls; you MUST do these quests in this order to gain enough Experience Points to progress.<br /><br />Worst of all, the extensive CG use made the movie feel disjointed -- as though it were split into two different planes of existence. Let's just say that if your CG can't pass for reality, you shouldn't use it! Please tell me how an OBVIOUSLY CG Prairie Dog is any better than an OBVIOUSLY FAKE Prairie Dog puppet. At least you feel like you can reach out and touch the puppet and that it exists somewhere! Instead, I felt like I was looking into a Dreamworks movie. Take, for example, the car chase along a perilous river gorge in Indy 4. Now, in Temple of Doom, when Indy is dangling over a precipice, you feel like Indy is going to topple over the cliff any second. In Indy 4, as they race along a sheer cliff, it looks like a video game. I realized that it was an obvious green screen and felt that there was absolutely no threat for Indy and co. at all.<br /><br />Characters<br />It is my belief that a film is only as good as its villains are. If this is so, ouch. The villain -- Blanchett as some KGB Trinity-lookalike with skin like porcelain and an obvious wig -- looked more like a doll than a person. Nor did she ever seem particularly threatening. If she was supposed to have psychic powers, they never showed it... so she seemed more like that creepy chick who sits by herself at lunch mumbling about getting in contact with THE OTHER SIDE. You know, creepy, but harmless.<br /><br />Indiana Jones himself didn't come across like his previous iterations... and don't get me wrong: his age was not part of it. I was actually looking forward to the movie to see how he succeeded in SPITE of his age. Instead, he came across as a ""Mary Sue"" -- he can instantly read extinct Mayan languages, and speak various sub-dialects of various South American peoples. He actually gets MARRIED in the end, which just didn't seem probable at all... and most terribly, instead of really feeling WITH him as I am always doing in the old Indy movies, I just felt like I was watching him from far away. I couldn't associate with him. He wasn't like a person anymore, but a stock character.<br /><br />Marion alone felt solid and real to me, but unfortunately, her character seemed to just be shunted in for one sole, goofy purpose.<br /><br />Don't get me started on the pasty white, skinny twit kid who is apparently going to take up the hat of Indiana Jones. Disgusting.<br /><br />Plot<br />Then the plot. Oh, the plot! It was like a scriptwriter came running to work one day and said, ""Guys, guys, I woke up in the middle of the night and I had this really cool dream and this is how it goes!"" And they were all hung over and one of them says, ""Oh, geez, my head hurts too much to think... let's just go with his idea.""<br /><br />Firstly: ALIENS. What?! Seriously?! Newsflash! This just ISN'T Indiana Jones. Let me break it down: what does Jones deal with in the previous movies? The occult, religion, stuff firmly planted on terra firma. Aliens are for sci-fi. Furthermore, how derivative can you possibly get?! I HATE UFO tales and their stereotypical aliens -- the ones with the gray skin and the huge heads and the huge black eyes. I have always hated them due to a combination of factors, mostly because I associate them with loonies and the downright irritating belief that human beings cannot survive on their own or develop their own technology without someone else's help. So for Indiana Jones to go this stereotypical way, this OBVIOUS way, just annoys me to the nth degree.<br /><br />Secondly, it's painful to recount how many elements were introduced and then instantly dropped. In the beginning of the movie, the FBI speaks to Indy, saying, ""You are now a person of interest to the FBI."" Indy goes on adventure. End of movie: the FBI is nowhere to be found. Then there's a downright BIZARRE scene where Indy drops in on a nuclear testing site. He narrowly survives a nuclear explosion in a lead-lined refrigerator, which was ridiculous on its own -- and then the explosion bounces that puppy thirty feet in the air seventy times which made it even more ridiculous. I suppose this was supposed to be a statement; whatever it was, it failed. What it ultimately had to do with the plot, nobody knows. A third weird thing: a convoy of trucks carrying KGB soldiers makes it into Area 51 without a fight. They kill about 12 soldiers guarding the gate and nobody is inside the base at all. Really? Are you kidding? Yeah, I know, ""weapons testing"", but it still doesn't make any sense. A secret base guarded by 12 people! Oh, please!<br /><br />Thirdly, I didn't see ANY point in half of the things they did. So they get Indy to work on the UFO crash site at Area 51? Uh... he's an ARCHAEOLOGIST. WHY would they need an archaeologist to examine a CRASH SITE? Secondly, if the thirteenth skull was stolen in the 1500s... well, uh, this implies that the circle of nifty glass Alien skeletons was complete for a long time. So... why did the Aliens suddenly decide to up and leave when the skull was returned? Why didn't they leave a long time ago? And why did the aliens care about Earth in the first place? And how did the KGB plan to harness their power, because they really seemed to be winging it. And furthermore, the Aliens didn't seem like very nice guys, and their response to having the final skull returned (which seemed like a nice thing on Indy and co.'s part) didn't make any sense. And why did they collect art from every culture in the world in one place only to entirely destroy it all, and why did they go crazy and start up the UFO and the interdimensional wormhole anyway? Although, I have to admit... by that point, I didn't care anymore. I just kept waiting for the movie to give me a reason to care.<br /><br />Fourthly: every single darn ""plot point"" was obvious. The minute they started carving into that body bag at Area 51, I knew there had to be an alien inside. When Indy started talking about the way Incans bound their heads to be elongated, I wanted to punch everyone who wrote the script. What was X-Files doing in my movie?!<br /><br />Fifthly: The monkey scene. Enough said.<br /><br />Finally, they seemed to have no idea about what native peoples lived in Peru. They talked about Mayan language, Mayan ideograms... except Maya DIDN'T have any footholds in what is now known as Peru; they lived in Central America. The Incans, however, did live in Peru. Oh, come ON! A basic Wikipedia search would have settled that question!<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />I think the movie disappointed me because I expected Indiana Jones and got a Sci-Fi Channel special. They broke all the rules of Indiana Jones' universe and introduced elements that utterly broke whatever magic could have been. They cast a skinny, obnoxious little twit to be our next dashing archaeologist/adventurer. The editing was awful, the plot was crap, the characters were all wrong, and they included crappy aliens. And that's annoying.<br /><br />As another reviewer succinctly stated: the movie devolves from an Indiana Jones movie to a movie with Indiana Jones in it."
B00447G29S	2.0	b	"The more I have seen of this movie the less I like it. My 3.5yr old likes it so I have seen it, or parts of it, quite a few times recently.<br />The graphics are very good, with amazing attention to details. In some cases it is absolutely brilliant with the reflections or expressions being very accurate or the body movements as the kids run along a squashy conveyor belt. But a scene where hot chocolate it being handed out and, more importantly, Santa are pretty poorly illustrated. The elves also look awful. The graphics is the reason for adding 2 stars. I have deducted stars for:<br />-The storyline is all about a boy who has started to doubt the existence of Santa and boards a magical train to the North Pole to see him. There is nothing about kindness or love or any of the real messages of xmas, it is all about presents and proving Santa exists.<br />-The train conductor is unneccesarily stern and intimidating.<br />-All the employees are incompetent, the train drivers who break and lose parts, lose control of the train and endanger the passengers, the elves who fail to lift the sack of presents high enough and nearly kill someone.<br />-What is with the spooky hobo/angel? He is mean and sarcastic but then helpful. But the way he gets hit by a low bridge and shatters into thousands of shards of ice is just scary for kids.<br />-There is just a lot of stuff that doesn't make sense. Why is the train so long when there is only one carriage of kids, one of toys and presumably one of hot chocolate servers? When they stop to pick up the last boy another boy comments on that being strange because he thought Hero Boy was the last pick up. How does he know who is last? What is the significance of this last minute addition? Nothing, as it turns out. Once at the North Pole the conductor asks all the kids to line up in two rows, odd birthdates on one side, evens on the other or some such. Why? If believing in Santa is so important why are such a small group of kids chosen to see him? When the main girl character loses her ticket the conductor takes her away, out the back carriage to walk across the train roof to the front and puts her in chanrge of driving th train while the driver changes a lightbulb. Why? And why is it when she is removed from the kids' carriage there is discussion and panic about her being thrown off the train for not having a ticket? The Boy From The Poor Neighbourhood has never received a present and understandably does not believe in Santa so why bring him to show him Santa is real and has, what, just chosen to never give him a present? Why do they all keep walking around on top of a moving train in a blizzard in only PJs and slippers? I wear a down filled coat anytime it is below 50F/10C even if sunny!<br />-The whole movie just seems to be building up suspense and questions that go unfulfilled. Near the end the conductor calls out something to Hero Boy who doesn't hear him and replies ""What?"" so the conductor calls out louder ""Merry Christmas!"". But there is the uneccessary suspense that the conductor has called out something significant and Hero Boy might miss the message."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	What a load of trash.  The movie's main focus is trying to relate Darwin to Hitler - it Godwins itself right from the get go.  To believe in the veracity of any of its scientific claims requires a near-total ignorance of modern microbiology, astronomy, and physics.  Even the average person with an undergraduate degree, even one not science-related should be able to refute the scientific claims in this movie.  It is childlike in its attempt to reconstruct biological principles, although it does precious little examination of actual science.  Instead, most of the film dedicates itself to taking science out of context, making false allegations about teachers being fired for their belief, and generally propagandizing creationism and lying about its critics and their beliefs.<br /><br />It's rare for the world's top film critics (The New York Times, Roger Ebert, the New York Daily News, Toronto Star, Globe and Mail, Newsday, Chicago Reader, Entertainment Weekly, New York Post, Village Voice, Time Magazine, Variety, Hollywood Reporter, USA Today, Newark Star-Ledger, the list goes on and on) to universally despise a film, but this one did it with its outlandish manipulations of fact, contempt for reason and truth, and willingness to, in a documentary, tell bald-faced lies about science, scientists, and the central claims of the film, bias in science education.<br /><br />This movie has no redeeming qualities at all.  If it were a person you would lock it away in prison.  If it were a textbook you would keep it out of the classroom.  It has nothing of value to offer, period.

B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"*In a nutshell: A chase film involving, drugs, money and murder.<br />* Looks superb<br />*Three featurettes on the making of the film while it isn't bare bones, it deserves better and more special features.<br />*Try to get it as inexpensive as possible because the Oscar win leads me to believe a DOUBLE DIP will be coming later.<br />*Won't be everyone's cup of tea but for those who enjoy the work of the Coens this is an exceptional film.<br /><br />A reflection on mortality, evil and how we can lose our place in the world is the focus of the Coen brothers film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. While set in 1980, the film really (like all films set in the past or future) is really about the average person copes in a world where the rules have changed so rapidly its as if the rug of reality has been pulled out from under us. It's about the changing landscape around us and how we adjust to the brutality that hides beneath the social veneer around us.<br /><br />In some respects ""No Country for Old Men"" reminds me of a horror film crossed with a modern day western (something the Coens suggest themselves in the extras).<br /><br />SOME MINOR SPOILERS:<br /><br />When Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles over the bodies of drug dealers and cash this Vietnam vet realizes that he's hit the mother lode; no one survived and no one will miss the money. Leaving the drugs, Moss makes off with the cash. When psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh (Academy Award winner Javier Bardem creating the most chilling character since Hannibal Lecter) begins leaving a trail of bodies in pursuit of Moss, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is drawn into the case trying to figure out what happened and try and help Moss before Chigurh catches up to him.<br /><br />Filled with memorable performances particularly from Brolin and a world weary performance by Jones, ""No Country for Old Men"" provides the perfect vehicle for the Coens to continue to mine the themes from previous films enrich and add depth to them. As the title implies Bell realizes that he's a man out of time; the world has changed and all his values no longer seem to be the basis for society, behavior and his reality. Chigurh something totally out of Sheriff Bell's experience--a psychopath with his own bizarre moral code who appears to be the devil incarnate punishing those he perceives to have crossed that moral code and often leaving the outcome of his encounters to the randomness of destiny represented by the coin toss he uses to often decide his victim's fate. As Bell learns, however, the violence has always been around him and has seeped into the very ground of the country he love so much but he's at a loss with how to deal with the blunt brutality that is engulfing his world where people had at least the trappings of civilization.<br /><br /> As with ""Fargo"" and ""Blood Simple"" the film is a mixture of grim reality and black humor with the latter providing a counterpoint to the few scenes of relentless and brutal violence that Chigurh unleases.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The DVD version of ""No Country for Old Men"" captures the superb photography of Academy Award nominated cinematographer Roger Deakins (who lost probably due to multiple nominations this year). His sweeping involving camera work captures the empty vistas of Texas creating the sense that Bell and others are trapped in something of a no man's land (or Hell...you can interpret it a number of ways). The muted vistas are perfectly rendered in both the DVD and Blu-ray with sharper image quality and detail in the latter particularly during the night scenes.<br /><br />The 5.1 audio mix deftly incorporates the ambience of the vast undeveloped land that surrounds our characters and comes to life brutally as action scenes are unleashed.<br /><br /> As with most Coen films that appear on home video, there's no commentary track (although cinematographer Roger Deakins would have been welcomed).  We do, however, get three long featurettes on the making of the film. Although I suspect we'll see a double dip at some point in the future due to the Oscars the film won, the featurettes really don't do enough to provide us with information on the making of the film compared to many others for lesser films.<br /><br />""The Making of No Country for Old Men runs about a half hour and has a lot of interviews and clips from the film. The most interesting aspect of this is the comments from the Coens who rarely provide us with a lot of insight into their world outside of the film itself.<br /><br />""Working with the Coens"" has interviews with the actors discussing how they work as a team and their impact on their performances. It's an interesting featurette with some incredible insights from Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem.<br /><br />""Diary of a Country Sheriff"" takes into Ed Tom Bell's world via interviews with Barden, Tommy Lee Jones and others. It provides interesting insights into the difficulty the sheriff has in adjusting to this new, bizarre, brutal world order.<br /><br /> A superb film that looks marvelous on both DVD and Blu-ray, the only drawback to ""No Country for Old Men"" is the lack of more substantive featurettes, interviews and a commentary track. I can highly recommend this film although I suspect there MIGHT be a double dip down the line (I'm on the fence on this...it needs more but I personally don't want to have to get this twice), this amazing, powerful film remains one of the Coens best since ""Fargo"". Although this film isn't for everyone, those who have seen other Coen films will enjoy this.<br /><br />**If you disagree post a review remember the voting system isn't about whether or not you agree or disagree about the merit of the film BUT whether or not the review helped you make a decision to buy the product.**"
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"CGI has allowed great film makers like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to totally throw away story and film-making. It's quite sad to see our older top directors and actors for that part continuing on in disgrace. Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull was one of the most disappointing movies I had ever seen. As soon as the computer chipmunk popped up in the beginning I knew the cgi tinkering would be outlandish and unbelievable. The only thing enjoyable about the movie is it's poster and dvd artwork which relates to the previous Indy films.<br /><br />Marian was a total waste of a character in this film. She was poorly brought back and treated as a tag along. Shia LaBeouf swinging on vines with computer aided cartoon monkeys completely destroyed all hopes for this movie living up to any possible par of the original Indy films. The ending was a bit long and not much fun to take in. It would have been nice to see a better representation of ancient technology and artifacts which suggested ""alien"" lifeforms were around in ancient day, but even from a true historical and archaeological sense the directors and writers failed.<br /><br />I think Spielberg and Lucas have become greedy and that is the only reason we now have to live with Indiana Jones 4. It is very sad to see our film makers fall from the once great visions they brought us in the past."
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	I liked the movie but it only had about 1 good action scene.  It seemed very scripted and not at all like the old Indiana movies.  Descent movie just wasn't the same for me.
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	I am a huge Potter fan --this movie was long-dark-boring-I was shocked as they are always the best.<br />The book was better-way better--maybe they shouldnt have dragged it out into 2 movies?
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	"I can't address ""Sin City""'s content because this is a polarizing film - either you adore it or you don't, and you already know which camp you belong to. Love it or hate it, ""Sin City"" is an amazing technical breakthrough. Roberto Rodriguez has always stretched his low budgets to the limit, but with ""Sin City,"" he proved that greenscreens and computer technology need not be limited solely to science fiction. The digitally-inserted backgrounds and compositing of different actors are totally convincing. Furthermore, unlike previous attempts at the technique (which look like Photoshop on acid), there's a realism present here that leads me to believe that smart producers in the future will rely more and more on greenscreens and less and less on location shooting. This is a rare example of special effects that are totally in service of the story. I think it's worth a look for that reason, especially if you're a budding computer-savvy filmmaker.<br /><br />How strange and cruel, then, that only a skimpy mini-documentary is included as a behind-the-scenes extra. They could bring us multiple ""collectable"" DVD cases, but they couldn't give us real insight into the making of this movie? This is nearly as bad as the very earliest DVD releases (such as ""2001"" and ""Blade Runner"") in which there were absolutely no extras to speak of. Why? Just a year ago a movie like ""Sin City"" would be a two-disc affair with extras that did everything short of telling us whether Rodriguez and Miller prefered ham sandwiches to cole slaw and now we get a bare bones package! It shows real contempt for the fans of this movie.<br /><br />If you absolutely must own this DVD right now, there's nothing I can say to persuade you otherwise. As for me, I'm riding this one out and waiting either for the inevitable upgraded version in a few months or a substantially cheaper used copy. Frankly, it's insulting that they can't give us extras but can give us our choice of four different DVD covers. It's a gimmick worthy of 1990s comic book companies, but totally unacceptable for a major Hollywood release."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	WARNING SPOILERS WARNING<br /><br />On the surface the script for Iron Man is simple and basic.  We find out the origin of Iron Man, how he builds the suit and a major villain arrives with a similar suit to challenge him.  Iron Man saves the day etc. rinse repeat.<br /><br />What makes this 'comic book' movie great and one of the best adaptations of all time is 1 thing.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr.<br /><br />I had been a comic book fan since I was a kid, and while I mainly collected Spider-Man, I knew Iron Man and his back story.  I knew him but never really was into him except when the story revolved around Tony Stark and his personal life.  While usually the book is better than the movie, this is one of those rare exceptions where the real life version far exceeds the book.<br /><br />Quite simply, like Heath Ledger as The Joker, you don't see Downey Jr. on the screen but Tony Stark.<br /><br />Yes, he's that good.<br /><br />Whoever casted Downey for this movie deserves a raise or % of the profits because without him the movie doesn't excel.  Yes the CGI is fantastic but the other people cast in the movie don't inspire the audience.  Paltrow is fine, Howard I thought was good (bad move replacing a decent character who wanted to return for the sequel with Don Cheadle as good as he is), Bridges is very good but this movie belongs to Downey Jr.<br /><br />Sometimes a basic script can be made exceptional when you find a definitive actor to play a role.  Not only will this film make comic book fans happy, it is perfect for both genders, all ages, or anyone that likes movies in general.<br /><br />One of the greatest comic book movies of all time and a joy to watch that instantly ranks in the top 5 of said adaptations ever made.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION

Too bad Hollywood ignores truth in art. And it is PERFECT for Valentine's Day!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This film was beatiful. The hyper violence, sexual dicptication of women, and pulp literay style of diction is what makes this film geared toward a specific audience of both the orignal comic and film noir. The film is not the the easily squimish, and in fact may be shocking to the causual viewer. For fans of noir, pop culture, john woo/terentino, and pulp, this is pure candy.If you couldn't get enough of the film, rest assured that the source comics will not dissappoint as well.

If you are just beginning to work out, try this program after about 2 months of working out and incorporating some cardio. ""Insanity"" is mainly a cardio workout that uses your own body weight as resistance. You MUST be able to commit 1 hour per day for 6 days per week in order to complete this 2 month program (along with following the nutritional plan).<br /><br />""Insanity"" pushes you harder and farther than you've ever thought you could push your body. As you progress through each week, you'll see that you are getting stronger, your endurance is increasing and you are not cursing the DVD ""as much"".

All changes for the better.<br /><br />It works great!!! But don't fool yourself into thinking this is a regular high intensity workout.

B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Great movie, enjoyed teh story which was backed up by great sound effects. When watching it at home with the home movie system, it almost took the pictures off the wall. Robert Downie Jr's best movie since Chaplin, just shows what a good script can do for your career. Gwyneth Paltrow played her role as the female butler exceptionally well.  Movie ends with the it set up for a sequal.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with this movie
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"Every time Martin Scorsese releases a new picture, the Oscar talk begins. Obviously, the world waits breathlessly for the next ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull"" or ""Goodfellas""--but it's not easy to craft a film of such enduring appeal. ""The Aviator,"" his last Best Picture nominee, is a handsome biopic bolstered by good performances--but hardly elicits the same passion as the Scorsese classics. And ""Gangs of New York,"" the nominee prior to that, is a genuinely muddled mess led by a terrific performance by Daniel Day Lewis. So that you may calibrate this review, I'm going to say it right now--in no way did ""Gangs of New York"" deserve to be among the top five films of it's year.<br /><br />""The Departed"" is this year's candidate, and I have no doubt it will receive many accolades from the Academy. It's a vastly entertaining tale based on Hong Kong's ""Infernal Affairs."" I don't know that I consider it to be among Scorsese's best work--but it certainly brings back a life and passion absent from some of his recent efforts. Brasher and more viscerally exciting than ""The Aviator,"" more coherent and intelligent than ""Gangs of New York""--""The Departed"" does remind you of the pictures made on the mean streets of Scorsese's earlier classics. And while the film is abundantly entertaining, thrilling and twisty--it is not without flaws either.<br /><br />First, the good. It's a terrific plot well executed--complicated and morally ambiguous. You can't help but be impressed with the layer upon layer of complexity as our characters live in worlds that are based on lies. How do you maintain the essence of yourself when you exist in a state of pretense? How to you survive and thrive when one mistake could mean your life? There are knotty ethical issues to be wrestled with throughout the picture--a lot more for the viewer to think about and contemplate than in your traditional action fare.<br /><br />Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio give fully realized, dynamic performances. It may be a career high for both actors--I appreciated their immersion into these men. They are bold and challenging portraits of two people trapped within situations that now define them. Free choice is limited and you can't play by the rules. Ruthlessness and dishonesty become necessary to survive--their lives parallel beautifully even though they are at odds. Nice characterizations from Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen are highlights as well. Wahlberg, in particular, has rarely been so alive on the screen.<br /><br />One element in the film that has been debated is Jack Nicholson's performance, however. Either you think it is a brilliant Jack Nicholson role or you wish for a little more restraint. Well, I almost always wish for some restraint with modern Nicholson (aside form the nice nuanced role in ""About Schmidt"")--but here, his over-the-top portrait actually serves the film well. I enjoyed his antics and it worked as a suitable counterpoint to the younger performers.<br /><br />The one element of the film I really struggled with, however, is the female character. Played by Vera Farmiga--she is more of a plot convenience than a real asset to the film. Awkwardly and unbelievably positioned between Damon and DiCaprio, she does little to heighten the drama. It's a huge suspension of belief to put her into the middle of things--and with only an unnecessary romantic subplot to show for it, it just isn't worth it. It's not Farmiga's fault, but the film came to a screeching halt every time she entered into it (especially her absurd doctor/patient interactions with DiCaprio).<br /><br />I definitely recommend ""The Departed."" Close to a great film, it's deliriously entertaining.  KGHarris, 11/06."
B0006989TE	5.0	b	When I get to the end of a film, and can't get it out of my head, that speaks highly for the quality of the experience.  The performances in this film are first rate, and the story unfolds at a very pleasing pace.  Character development is important in a quality film, and 'The Village' meets this need beautifully.  Cinematography/direction/film editing is beyond words, as well as the quality of the DVD transfer.  The score by James Newton Howard - and the performance thereof - is some of the most amazingly beautiful music you will ever hear - it fit the picture like a glove, and was integral in making this one of the most fulfulling movies I have seen in quite some time.
B004JMSIRC	2.0	b	"The special effects were excellent.  There were moments of comedy, and the plot was decent.  I particularly appreciated the attempt to support nonviolent action.  The acting by Jeff Bridges, Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, and Gwyneth Paltrow was amazing- though some credit needs to go to the make-up job as well.  I was racking my brain, for I knew I'd seen these actors before, but they did such a good job of embracing new characters, of becoming characters, that I lost sight of the actors themselves.  This had the makings of a great movie, for its genre.<br /><br />There are some glitches, however.  Repeatedly people go into Stark's chest cavity without a sterile environment- when everyone knows this is just a recipe for infection and disease.  There are difficulties with how fast the villain learns how to use the weapons.  But of greatest difficulty is the dating of the material.<br /><br />Honestly.  We are in the 21st century.  Do we still need caricatures of people groups appearing as incompetent buffoons and inherently evil?  This film reads as if the director took his cues from Shaheen's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1566563887"">Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People</a>.  Nearly every classic point of Arab stereotyping in Hollywood is followed by this movie.  A full third of the runtime is spent with the evil Muslims and Arabs, yelling in Arabic and killing people and thirsting for more weapons.  All of this takes place in Afghanistan, but there seem to be few Afghanis around.  It's a multinational terrorist force, run mostly by Arabs, and in Arabic.<br /><br />Sure, it's only a comic book movie. I'm not expecting the in-depth real-life drama of the Afghani <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012OX7EO"">The Kite Runner</a>.  But comics and the movies- indeed all of popular culture- have the ability to greatly influence us.  This after all is the goal of anyone who creates a quality movie.  Indeed, this has often been the maxim of The Great One - Stan Lee (who incidentally has his best cameo ever in this film).  Stan Lee often speaks of how much comics can influence culture, that they should not be viewed merely as comics.  He often very purposely puts his crusade for justice into the midst of his characters and stories. Sadly, some don't take the words of the author seriously- that his stories matter, that justice matters.<br /><br />There is of course the courtesy good Arab guy who initially helps Stark out, but we barely know he's Arabic.  He looks less swarthy, he's a polyglot, and rarely speaks Arabic.  In mannerisms and culture he acts like a typical American- letting us know that Arabs are alright as long as they are so much like us that we don't have to realize that they are Arabic.<br /><br />As my stomach turned, I kept hoping that the movie would somehow redeem its initial treatment of Arabs, perhaps showing us in some way how the Arabs in the movie came to desire weapons, because their homes were trashed by the Americans and Stark was selling weapons everywhere.  Evidently no redemption was possible.  With one exception, the only people Iron Man kills are Arabs, but there are thrilling moments of him going out of his way to rescue Americans who were attacking him.  (By this point we've obviously lost the hope for the non-violent focus that was initially so promising.)  The coup de grace is the line from the ultimate villain to the head Arab villain, that ""their part of the world"" has never been able to keep up technologically.  It's not just that the Arabs are villains.  They are bad villains.  They can't even do that right.<br /><br />The issue of course is not one movie.  It is rather that, in the thousands of movies that Arabs and Muslims have been shown in in Hollywood history, nearly all of them have been stereotypical or negative portrayals.  (About fifty have been positive.)  And Iron Man has suddenly risen to the top of this infamous list.  There was no need to use Arabs and Muslims in this modern portrayal of the Iron Man myth, for there are plenty of other villains around.  If Arabs were to be the villains, there was no need to show them as stereotypes.  If Arabs and Muslims were to be the villains, the directors could have taken this opportunity to show how they are also humans, and there are reasons that they turn to a life of violence.<br /><br />If you see this movie, consider as you watch it if every single Arab or Muslim in the movie was replaced by a Jew.  It's not so far-fetched.  Movies of the 30s commonly had the stereotypical Jew in the role that Arabs and Muslims now fill all too often today.  But we now realize portraying most minorities as stereotypes and over-the-top villains is wrong.  Thank God we now know this is anti-Semitic, and have rejected such racist portrayals.  Except Arabs are Semites too.<br /><br />This movie had the directing, acting, and writing to have a lot of potential.  As it is, it will show all over the US and confirm American prejudices of Arabs and Muslims.  Then it will show all over the world, and confirm Arab and Muslim beliefs of what we think of them.  And that won't go very far in obtaining peace."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I just went to see this movie last night and I have to say that this is one outstanding movie and creative production!  This is definitely a movie that you have to experience!  The animation in this movie is just outstanding and the characters look SO real.  I felt like I actually knew the girl in the story, she seemed so realistic, and all the children really.  The mannerisms and facial expressions of the children are so close to what children are really like.  Some of the scenes are just breathtaking.  It is nice that they tried to match the 3D animation with the illustrations in the book so closely.  I can't imagine the work that went into this production and I say kudos to the producers/illustrators of this wonderful family film.  I've heard that this movie is also being shown in 3D Imax theatres and wow that would be fantastic.<br /><br />The storyline is also very well done and the sound of the bell is symbolic of the belief in Santa Claus.  It is a movie about the belief in the Spirit of Christmas as well.  One of the 4 main characters believes already, one doesn't believe, one has the wrong idea of what Christmas is about (i.e. getting), and the other is disillusioned.  It is neat to see how these characters are developed and how they achieve that belief in Christmas and Santa Claus by the end of the movie.  It is emphasized that the Spirit of Christmas is inside us.<br /><br />Some of the scenes may be a little frightening for small children.  I found the scene when the train goes on the ice to be a bit scary but maybe this was because I was watching it on a 30 ft. screen!  I think the conductor says 'blazes' a couple of times, and some people may not like the ghost on the train idea or that the children are climbing out of the train (do not to this at home, yikes!).<br /><br />I am definitely going to see this movie again.  I loved it so much I went out and bought the book and the soundtrack both of which are really outstanding.  The movie has retained the flavour of the book and isn't it great that it is motivating more people to read the book!?  This is not just a movie for children, and if you have a childlike heart you will absolutely love it.<br /><br />I want to add that because I am a teacher of the deaf and hard of hearing, I tried out the Rear Window Captioning as it was available in one theatre.  The person at the customer service desk gave me a reflector on a stick that fit into my cup holder.  The words were in red at the back of the theatre and I could view these in my transparent reflector.  It was difficult to get the right positioning sometimes, but I can see that it could be very helpful for some people.  That is what RWC beside the movie listings means and also sometimes headphones are also available in those theatres as well.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	LOVE THIS DVD!  I highly recommend it for anyone that has questions about whether organic foods are necessary.  It's an eye-opener!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Cars is not only a fabulous movie, but is also a life saver in many situations regaurding my two year old.  We take our kindle everywhere we go, just in case we find ourselves stuck in any one place for a long time.  We are able to make long hospital visits.  I am also able to enjoy an occasional workout session here and there!
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	This one surprised me. I watched it for the curiosity factor. I was expecting more wooden acting from Stuart. She has a little more depth in this role. The movie it's self had some amazing special effects. I will check out a movie for that alone. As far as story and plot, it was a little shallow, but we are talking about a dark remake of a children's story. I can live with that. Don't watch this expecting an Oscar classic. This is more of a visual journey and a chance to see a mix of experienced and relative new comers in the acting world.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I had heard about the violence in this movie, which did shock me a bit, but this was an amazing movie. See it!
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	I bought blu-ray disc with digital copy. Used MAC. Followed instructions. Digital copy did not download through iTunes store, but user code shutoff anyway. DO NOT BUY!!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Not a lot to say ... have ssen this at least 10 times ... and the wife and I still laugh.  Shown it to some neighbors too ... they also loved it.  Jeff is great .... he needs a 3rd DVD.  I'll be first in line to buy it.  Definitely worth at leats twice the price.  If you haven't seen Jeff, you don't know what you are missing.
B0032CNOK6	3.0	b	Whatever your views, all can agree with Ben Stein that the question of ID causes people to become impassioned. He correctly identifies that there are two Gospels - the ID Gospel and the Darwinian Gospel - neither are scientific fact, they are, in actuality, theories. Both pose serious problems and scientists know that. Both take faith in unseen and unanswered questions.<br /><br />The most important point he brings up about ID is why it has not gone away. The status quo states that ID has already been debated and rejected, and there is nothing left to say. However, theories that have not been *adequately* answered have a way of sticking around. ID has not been adequately answered by science and those who reject the theory routinely refuse those who want to talk about it free scientific inquiry, chastising them and expelling them from the scientific community. This type of biased science that is not open to free inquiry has damaged the scientific community.<br /><br />What really fascinated me about Richard Dawkins and other atheist evolutionists is how they turn to aliens as a possibility for life on earth. Even the atheists turn to the sky looking for answers - it is a new mythology rooted in the scientific community, and that my friends, is great irony.<br /><br />Point: The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins<br />Counter-Point: The Dawkins Delusion by Alister McGrath<br /><br />Blu-ray PQ: 3.5/5.0<br />Blu-ray AQ: 3.5/5.0<br />Supplements: 2.0/5.0<br />Movie: 3.0/5.0
B0032CNOK6	2.0	b	"I give this ""film"" two stars for the simple reason that it is a great piece of pure propaganda and nothing more. It is, as many have stated, an insult to the intelligence of everyone or watches and can stomach through it, be they religious believer or not. Ben Stein doesn't know anything about science nor do the makers of this film. It is not just that they don't understand evolution, they don't understand the scientific method. Something isn't true or not because of the moral implications of it being true, that is basic logic. If the Nazis used evolution to justify the holocaust(which they didn't) it doesn't make it not true! If I use relativity theory to justify murder, that doesn't mean gravity isn't true! People use God to justify murder, doesn't make God not true. Ben Stein states that evolution doesn't explain gravity and other scientific subjects. Yes, because evolution describes the origins of the various species, it doesn't pretend to explain a field entirely seperate from itself! Then there is the fact that there was more to these cases of these scientists supposedly fired. It is an utter travesty in the 21st century that this movie is taken seriously. Also left unexplained is the supposed designer. A designer will have to be more complex then his designed cause. In fact, scientists featured in this film were EXPELLED from screenings. How ironic. Future generations will look back at this movie and wonder what the people of our time were thinking. This movie was based purely on pushing creationism, nothing more.<br /><br />  As I said before, one of the main problems with this film is that it does not understand the fact that something is not true or not because of the implications of it being true or not. For example, in its' attempts to connect the Nazis with evolution, it does not understand that if some individuals used Darwin to promote Nazism does not mean that Evolution or Natural Selection or to use the term it uses throughout the film, Darwnism, is not true. At best it is an argument why it should not be true or believed to be true but not on the question is it true or not. For example, if belief in quantum mechanics led to someone committing violence against another, that doesn't make quantum mechanics true or not. If a Christian commits violence, it does not make Christianity untrue. Ironically in its' attempt to argue against evolution based on some who might have believed in it using it as a justification for the Nazi regime, it ignores the fact that while many Christians opposed the Nazis, some though unfortnately supported and even helped vote them into office in 1933. It ignores the fact that Germany in 1933 was heavily religious (much more then today). That of course does not make Christianity untrue, just as evolution is not untrue because of some of the actions of some who might have believed in it or took actions by misinterpeting it to justify their actions, as some individuals have done with the Christian religion.<br /><br />The film while a supposed critique of evolution does not touch on that subject. Its' criticisms when it deals with the actual subject matter of science is critiques on abiogensis, the origins of life. But, evolution is true or not based on its' own evidence, not on where the origins of life came from. They are two different fields of biology. For example, it is well known that there are electrons in atoms but the idea that matter is composed of strings is very much still debated. That matter is composed of string or not doesn't mean that atoms don't have electrons. One is settled science and one is not. Second, any supposed designer of life begs the question who is this designer. If it is a deity, then where did this deity come from. If the answer is it is a matter of faith then one must ask why should science be involved in matters of faith? If the supposed answer to a scientific question is one that creates more problems then the supposed solution, is it a good scientific explanation? Second, if the supposed designer is an alien being or race then who again (like the deity) caused or created them? But those who support ID for the most part don't take seriously the idea that life was started by alien beings. Like most ID supporters (though not all) they believe that the earth and life was created about or less then 10,000 years ago. Expelled is a movie that wishes to promote a view of the earth being 10,000 years old or less but doesn't want to say it directly. Those who view the film are much more likely to believe in a ""Young Earth"" then the US population at large. So, the language of Intelligent Design is used to appeal to more Americans then it would if it would just say the earth is less then 10,000 years old.<br /><br />Evolution itself, like any science, does not deal with the subject of evolution. It only deals with observations and other tools of science. Something that doesn't use a scientific approach isn't science even if it is by chance true. If a designer cannot be tested and gives a solution to a problem (where does the designer come from for instance) more complicated then the problem itself there is no scientific reason to believe in it.<br /><br />The film in a pre-screening ironically expelled one of the pro-evolutionist scientists that it had interviewed for the film. So much for irony. Dr. PJ Myers was made to leave the screening of the film though he had reserved seating and gave his and all other members of his party, accurate names.<br />Dr. Myers is one of the scientists (along with Dr. Richard Dawkins) that the producers of the film tricked by misleading them it was differing kind of documentary.<br /><br />This movie lies about the Miller experiment in the 1950s that produced amino acids of a simulated early earth. The film simply says the experiment ""failed."" While the chemicals and the atmosphere was more complex then the 1950s experiment, modern experiments with a more complex atmosphere that simulates an early earth have created amino acids. In fact, this shows that the creation of amino acids is pretty common. In fact we know this to be true because amino acids that are from outer space have been found.<br /><br />Ben Stein and his fellow Intelligent designers try to pretend that they could just as easily be talking about aliens as a deity but they mock a scientist who proposed that life could be seeded by aliens. Stein also mocks in the movie and post interviews, Dr. Richard Dawkins, who was asked by Stein if there was a designer what did he believe the designer to be like. Dawkins said aliens was most likely designer but again, there would have to be a natural cause for even that kind of alien designer. Dawkins did not believe (as Stein blately lies) that aliens seeded the earth but what was most likely designer. This example is just symbolic for the greater lieing and distorting that this propangda happens to be.<br /><br />Ben Stein and the makers of the film in contrast to pro-evolution scientists and writers such as Dr. Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens etc refuse to go on radio or tv talk shows where their views might be challenged by a non softball question. Dawkins, Hitchens and others on that side commonly go on shows where they have to defend their point of view. In other words their arguments are strenghtened because that environment (or criticism) forces them to defend their views making them more even more reasoned out and stronger. Ironically kind of like natural selection or ""Darwinism"" in action. The film also reportedly made cost $20 million to make much more then its' earnings of around $7 million even though it was heavily promoted by conservatives on the radio.<br /><br />This movie is what it is, it bashes evolution through associating it with atheists. The movie makers' understand that atheists are a despised group, especially among those who believe in creationism and who will watch this film. So, it associates atheists with evolution even though most Americans who believe in evolution also believe in a deity. After all, only about 10% of Americans lack a belief in a deity but about 50% believe in evolution. Even if only atheists believed in evolution that wouldnt' be an argument against evolution, which again is settled based on the evidence for or against it. Not what people want to believe."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"This series just keeps getting better. Each episode is darker and more serious than the one before, but that is because it is leading up to a tremendous finale in the last chapter.  Each episode comes up to a confrontation between the heroes and the forces of evil.  In this one, Harry is not alone.  He has made friends over the years at Hogwarts and they gather around to help him.  He is also introduced to the Order Of The Phoenix, which is a group of mature wizards and witches joined together to fight ""he whose name is not spoken"".  The confrontation in this episode takes place in just about the spookiest location yet.  The set designers really deserve an award for this one. And we finally get to see professor Dumbledore square off in a duel against ""you know who"".<br />  I just wish the people who put together the special feature packet would realize that neither Harry or his fans are still eleven years old.<br />It is eleven years since the series started. The fans who started reading at ten years old in 1997 are now 21 years old.  They are much too mature for the childish games that dominate the special features disc.  Certainly those games have a place for the younger fans who have joined over the years, but there should be some more mature material for those of us who have been with Harry from the beginning, and it should be noted that, in the books, Ms Rowling never spoke down to her readers in the blatant way the narrators of the special features do.  Come on, guys, Harry is growing up, his fans have grown up, and it's about time you did, too.<br />  Minor gripes aside, this is a well made adventure with plenty of action, character developement, and just plain fun for any Harry Potter fan."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	What an amazing story!  Potter continues to be assaulted by the Dursleys and worse, it seems the whole world is now coming down on him.  Will Harry survive?  Will he have the strength and courage to carry on and over come the dark lord once more?  Yes he will with a little help from his friends.  The Order of the Phoenix is a story about drawing on the strength of love and friends to overcome those who are out to get you.  This movie will tug at your heart and reinforce that the good guys always win in the end.  If you love the other Harry Potter movies you will definitely love this one.<br /><br />Of course you must understand that I have not read the book because reading the book first tends to ruin the movie for me.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	One of our prize DVDs  This guy is talented and Very funny! The package arrived timely and the quality of the DVD was  great!  Great gift idea!
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	The movie was OK, certainly not as good as the others.  However the biggest problem is if your Blue Ray player/TV connects together using Component cables you will only see 480i.  Paramount has apparently disabled the HD output unless an HDMI cable is used.  Recommend you buy the standard DVD if your setup needs Component cables.  I have never seen this issue on any other disks.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	Looks fantastic on BluRay.  Special effects are phenomenal...this wouldn't be the same movie if it were filmed 5 years ago.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly casted as Tony Starks and the rest of the cast fits well.<br /><br />2nd disc is interesting although with more of these BluRays were just packaged with the movie by itself.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	This is the first film of the year I've seen and immediately felt compelled to go and buy another ticket. Javier Bardem basically embodies stateless terrorism and he deserves every acting award that's coming to him, but it's also important to note that Tommy Lee Jones delivers a performance on par with his work in Three Burials AND Bardem. That said, the performances are nearly flawless -- just like the filmmaking. AO Scott's write-up in the New York Times hits the nail on the head. If you love a lean script, subtle camera work, nuanced dialogue, gorgeous cinematography and sound; then this is going to be on your Top Ten list for the year. If you have trouble deciphering poetry and would prefer to see people being shot and things blowing up...well, you get that too. (9/10)
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	The Departed is a powerful film with extraordinary performances by everyone involved.  DiCaprio deserved an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Billy Costigan, a tormented young man barely surviving the double life he leads.  Matt Damon also shines.  I don't want to write everything that happened in this movie, I invite you to find that out for yourself.  Just know that you will not be disappointed.  Hands down the best movie of 2006!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I had seen a little bit of Jeff on Youtube so I ordered this video. It was totally worth the money and I loved every minute of it. I would highly recommend this video to anyone. He is so funny!!!!!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I love Sci-Fi, Wizards, and Adventure stories like Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Complex adventures like Indiana Jones and the Hunt for Red October (Tom Clancey). They take to places I have never been away from my dull existence. I can't wait to see the next Harry Potter, The Half-Blood Prince!<br />Product received in good condition within a week . Thanks!
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	"Two scenes in the movie that make this not worth watching for me.  The first one is when all the troopers are celebrating at the station and the secretary or whatever she was brings Matt Damon that coffee mug with wine and he thanks her for it, and then she looks at him and the camera focuses directly on her and she says,""No, thank you.""  WTF!!!!  Corn.  The second scene is when they are having the funeral for the troopers and they give them the old twenty-one gun salute.  They cut to a group of cops around Matt Damon and when one of the shots rings out from the rifle detail, the whole group flinches.  These are people that knew a shot was coming and they still jumped like they had no idea.  Small things like that generally can ruin a movie for me and this was no exception.  Leo can also ruin a movie as well so you throw him and Baldwin in the mix and it's a all out crapfest.  Save your two and half hours you are going to waste watching this movie and read a book or head to the gym or something."
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	I always find it interesting to browse through the reviews. Everyone knows what opinions are like.......and yes everybody does have one. New and innovative films are sometimes lost on those in our society that believe that in order to enjoy a film they must be able to relate. Instead they attempt to take in a film that they do not understand and criticize harshly. When I sat down to watch this film I did not know what to expect never having read the graphic novels. Black and White film no matter in your personal camera or a Movie camera has a special quality and when mixed with just a dab of the right colors and at the right times just sets it off the same way that certain colored shirt or accessory helps bring out the best in you. The characters are amazingly compelling, semi hard to relate to with just enough 50's feel about them to give you a feeling of familiarity. This movie is not for everyone as the rating suggests due to over the top violence, sex scenes, and its very sexist portrayal of women. Interesting though that people can view the daily news of which contains the very armpit details of our world culture and then talk about it at the water cooler like its the most important thing in life, but be offended by a movie that is more akin to a piece of modern art. Open your mind, be mature about it, don't take it to seriously and just sit back and watch the fireworks that this film displays.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	There has been a lot of negative remarks about Kristen Stewart in this movie. I don't think she was all that bad. I am sure there are other actresses who could have given a stronger perforamnce but the way this script was writtten, in my opinion, the story line was not about Snow White it was about the effects on the people after the Queen came to power, Snow White was a by product of those effects. Kristen may not have added anything extrodinary to the film but she really didn't detract from it either. Charlize was magnificent as always, and the special effects were awsome, and Chris well he is just a cutie!! Over all a pretty good movie.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"I just got back from seeing The Village and I am utterly amazed by this movie. It was hands down, without question, the best movie I seen this year; maybe in a long time. It was haunting, moving, gave food for thought and yes, did have a few moments that were chilling. This was movies when they are utterly great.<br /><br />Everybody thinks that this is supposed to be scary but it's not. At the heart of it, it's a love story. And that is what I love about Shyamalan's movies. Is that there is always these little messages entwined in the ""spookiness."" His movies are a rarity in this world, they actually are about something. And here, the theme is love and what love will push us to do.<br /><br />Another issue in this movie is, at least to me, is that what really is real? We see the world as we we see it but really is it real? The big twist in this movie is that it was modern day, there is no bogeyman in the woods. The villagers were only shown what they were meant to see. So, it gives pause, maybe this is a reflection of our own reality. Ivy said it best when she said, ""I see the world, not as you see it.""<br /><br />But the scenery, the costuming and violin inspired soundtrack was haunting. The feeling of being in a small Amish styled village was captured very well. This movie was eye-candy in it's own way.<br /><br />Another thing I liked that this was an ensemble cast, not a star-driven thing. Joaquin Pheonix was great as the stoic Lucius but he did not capture my attention like three other cast members did. Bryce Dallas Howard was amazing as Ivy, the blind girl that Lucius loved. I really hope she goes on to become a big star. She's that good. Adrian Brody as Noah was also well done. At first I felt sorry for Noah, since he was slow but mid-movie, my pity turned to disgust and he was great as well. I also liked Signourney Weaver a lot as well. I just loved how she knew the secrets and how it seemed to get to her at times. She captured that feeling well.<br /><br />But overall, if you see a movie this week, go see The Village."
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	Not every movie has to speak to everyone.  For instance, I can't stand Stanley Kubrick movies-  I think he's an over rated hack.  And just like that, some folks are not going to be predisposed to like this film.  If you are predisposed to be an anti-christian bigot, this film will rub you the wrong way.  If you aren't married and don't care for marriage, this film will pass you by as well.<br /><br />Technical merits-  yes, the reviews that say this would work better as a Lifetime movie are correct- although, I think this would fit better on the Hallmark channel. ;) Some of the special effects were a bit on the cheap side, but they weren't so bad as to distract from the movie.  My biggest technical pet peeve was not riled- there were no booms in any of the frames- something I see more and more often in professional big budget Hollywood movies- so the budget here did put some constraints no the picture, but it is more in the sense of constraint, rather than resulting in an appearance of amateurism.<br /><br />Acting merits- Kirk Cameron was great- the rest tried really hard and none of them stunk. Holding this movie to the Hallmark Channel standard, and you can say they all put in fine performances- none were oscar worthy, but that's not really where this movie is aiming. The yelling scene at the beginning was believable- I'm sort of baffled by the reviewers that didn't get that.  Frustrated folks lash out- and some people are yellers.  Such is life.<br /><br />Plot and Story-  The first twenty minutes of this movie are the hardest to get through.  Most films get you to like people before they throw them through the wringer- this movie does it backwards.  You won't like anyone in this movie for the first fifteen to twenty minutes.  Why?  Because this is a film about a marriage about to fall apart and when a marriage is that broken, no one in it is at their best.  We are presented  with two selfish, self centered people.  (Yes, two, for those that cheered for the wife the whole way through the film!) It takes a while to warm up to them.<br /><br />The role of Christianity in the movie-  Christianity is a true Deus ex Machina in this film.  But, for those that experienced salvific grace, that's exactly what it is. This movie was made by a Church, so should you really be surprised that Jesus gets a starring role?  Isn't it more surprising that in a country as Christian as this one, that we don't see conversion experiences playing a larger role in more films than we do?<br /><br />This movie will make you cry, without a doubt.  And any stupid thing you did to your spouse in the last week?  You're going to end up appologizing for it.  But that's what this movie is for- not to entertain, but to help people build up stronger marriages.  And in that, five stars is not enough.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I watched this movie in the theater on opening weekend!  I have told all my friends & family about this inspirational movie!  I can't wait to own it on DVD!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I don't normally like this type of movie, and I only went to see it because my work rented a theater for us for a day and this happened to be playing.  I am SO GLAD I saw it!  You couldn't ask for a better cast.  After this, I want to see every movie Leonardo DeCaprio stars in!  I even went to see it a second time and am pre-ordering the DVD (and I very rarely ever buy DVDs!).  Others that I talked to that saw it thought it was gory, but I did not think it was that bad at all - and believe me, I am not one to watch gory movies!  So if you've heard that about this movie, please don't let it stop you from seeing it.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	Lucas and Spielberg? How can it be? I am so shocked and disappointed at how bad this film is. I used to love these movies growing up and can't understand why they put this out with seeming no effort, no passion, amateur effects and terrible acting. Even Cate Blanchett was a disaster in this film, with her cheeso Russian accent. From 10 minutes into the film, my husband and I were talking about how bad it was. We tried to stick it out to the end but it only got worse and we shut it off 3/4 of the way through. Not even tolerable to finish.  It actually had a low budget feel to it.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	When I ordered the latest Harry Potter DVD, I expected the two disk version offered by other retailers but only received one disk with none of the other options.  Other than that I was satisfied with the DVD.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	If you want to laugh till your sides hurt these are for you, they are great!!!
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	Ok...I saw this at the movies and it was terrible. I felt like I was always trying to catch up and figure out what the point was. Total waste of time!!!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"Since being inculcated in evolution theory for 16 years of formal education, I accepted it as truth.  After seeing this film I decided to examine the evidence for myself.  I found there is compelling scientific evidence for intelligent design.  The matter should no longer be relegated to status as a ""social issue.""  It is a scientific issue and should be studied and debated openly.  It is foolish to continue to dismiss the intelligent design argument as merely religious.  Look at the evidence for yourself.  A thinking person cannot see it and deny that it does have merit."

B0006989TE	3.0	b	"Cast your mind back to 1999. Thinking about ""the Matrix""? or ""Star Wars: Ep. 1: The Phantom Menace"". What about ""the Sixth Sense"". the cinematic introduction of M. Night Shyalaman (not counting ""Praying with Anger"" or ""Wide Awake""). The thriller of the year, it woahed critics and movie goers alike.<br /><br />""Unbreakable"" followed, and cut the Shyalaman fanbase in half, as did ""Signs"" in 2002, but it was this reviewers favourite Night movie.<br /><br />He's back, with a darkly gothic thriller set in a small Pensylvanian village in the late 1800s. The villagers are cut off from the outside world due to a large wood that surrounds the village. According to the Village elders, a mythtical race of creatures inhabits the woods and they live in peace with a truce: The villlgefolk stay out of the woods, and the creatures stay out of the village.<br /><br />Under the guidence of Edward Walker (William Hurt), the village childeren are educated and there is no need for intervention from the Outside world. Until Lucious Hunt (Jaquin Pheonix, brilliant as ever) ventures into the wood, and the truce ids broken.<br /><br />Sounds thrilling doesnt it? Well sadly, ""The Village"" never really gets off the ground. The picturesque surroundings are the most exciting thing in the very slow build up, which is only watchable due to Pheonix and Ron Howards daughter Bryce Dallas, who plays William Hurt's daughter Ivy, who is blind. Their performances are excellent, so natural and truly wasted in a bizarrly poor Shyalaman screenplay (nothing like the excellently black comedy edge to ""Signs"" that just teetered above satire).<br /><br />The first half is lit up by one set piece, the creatures coming into the village to warn us the truce has ended, and that is very well done, Shyalaman showing shades of genuis behind the flaws.<br /><br />The second half concerns Pheonix being stabbed and Ivy having to cross the woods to seek medical help for her true love. Sadly, 90% of the second act is dishwasher dull and contains twists that most people will see coming. (No Keyzer Soze, then!).<br /><br />The performances vary, beyond the excellence of the leads, William Hurt shines, but talent is wasted on the supporting characters. Adrian Brody plays a mentally challanged villager, but there is no depth role for him to delve into.<br /><br />This also goes for Sigourney Waever and Brenden Gleeson.<br /><br />The most frustrating thing about ""The Village"" is that its not awful, if you think about it, it's quite good, but when you think of the high standards Shyalman has set himself, it falls very short. Average for him, but certainly worth a trip down the multiplex for."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"I am a 60 year old man; I am offended by any reviewer/ critic who would find any fault in this DVD. The most important message in this DVD is what the true meaning of Christmas really is; not to spend money or overdo the ""commercialism"" of Christmas; to exchange each other at Christmas, to be good to each other and not ""think only of yourself"". This DVD gives you the true meaning of Christmas. Tom Hanks is awesome in his roles in this ""gem"" Also when we were young how many of us,  like the ""know it all"" acted like the ""know it all""? I am guilty a he is.To those who find it scary, GROW UP!!!!

B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	When I saw this in theaters, I wasn't sure what to expect. At first I was annoyed to see that it was going to be split up into two film installments. However, I was pleasantly surprised when the credits started rolling. I went back to see it three more times! The first half of the book was good but a tad slow, and the filmmakers made sure this wasn't the case for the movie. They created a proper balance of comedy, action, and character development. If you like the Harry Potter series, you will not be disappointed. Needless to say, I'll be getting my copy on DVD when it hits shelves on April 15th!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"I just have to say, ""Cars"" is yet another great and exciting film from Pixar.<br /><br />The storyline is very great, and having a world of cars and no people whatsoever is very cool.<br /><br />The movie is also very humorous, with unforgetable charecters like Mater the towtruck and Lightning McQueen the famous racecar.<br /><br />Kids will love this movie, and so will adults.<br /><br />From what i've heard, it's gonna come out on dvd in November of this year, so I can't wait!"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"This is a comic book brought to life.  This means that you must set aside your rational understanding of physics and science and just relax and enjoy what is a marvelous adventure. Everyone knows that Robert Downey Jr. has some serious character flaws but if there was ever any doubt regarding his acting ability this film should put that to rest. There is no doubt but that Downey is one of the best actors around today -- maybe even the best.  This screenplay in the hands of less capable actors could have been campy or dull but Bridges, Downey, and Paltrow turn it into a really excellent film.  In fact the acting is so good thoroughout that Paltrow's performance is easily overlooked but she is marvelous at showing her love for Downey while he is totally oblivious to her or to his unrecognized love for her.<br /><br />To some this may appear to be an anti-war film or a film with some sort of moral message and maybe they are right -- I really don't know all I know is that this was a really enjoyable film and Downey's performance made it all worth while.<br /><br />I did stay through the seemingly endless credits to see the 30 sec tag scene that foreshadows the sequel.  All I can say in the way of a hint is ""what happened to the reconstructed prototype suit?""<br /><br />I gave this film 5 stars and I thought it deserved everyone of them."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I love the Harry Potter series and the Hallows lives up to the rest of the movies and maybe even exceeds them.  Harry is growing up and facing his biggest fears, and it feels as though you're right there with them when you watch this on blu ray.  I would recommend this movie, and if you haven't watched the others.....get started :0)
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	Pixar has quite a high bar to maintain and they falter a little on this one.  Based on my 12 year old neice's suggestion, she and I watched this film.  Pixar's usually pretty good right?  Both of us at one point looked at each other about half way through to figure out what time it was.  The film has great messages and wonderful animation but the execution is really flat and boring.  Pixar is noteable for being exceptional, something that's hard to do with animated films that will be appealing to both kids and adults.  It's enjoyable for the most part but this clearly is the first of the Pixar films to fall noticeably short.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	Ok, so when the previews started for this movie I was so excited to see it. i told everyone about it and got them wanting to see it. The first hour of the movie it wasnt mindblowing or anything but it was good. Then there was the climax and the ending. Uh huh, I was upset. I walked out of the theatre flaming mad and seriously wanting to write a letter. i think it was false advertisment. yup, thats exactly what it was.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BYLFFS"">Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed</a><br />Dear Mr. Ben Stein,<br />  There was, is, and ever shall be an Intelligent Design, by God!<br />  We ordered your DVD, Expelled, because you are funny and the commercial clip was funny; however, the story is not funny.  We agree with your premise.  I found the facts scary, but my husband thought the DVD was boring (hence, the 1-star rating).<br />  A daughter's family likes you, wanted to see something funny, and they also agree with your ideas; so they wanted to borrow it when we were finished. After describing Expelled somewhat, I suggested she have her husband preview it before the rest of the family (ages 9-21 yrs.)saw it; because of the real and scary pictures of Hitler and the Holocaust.  The 21-year-old girl is a junior at Olivet Nazarene University in  Bourbannais, Illinois, majoring in communications.  Since she would certainly appreciate the content, I told her she could take it back to college and share it with her professors.<br />  As you can see, we liked it, but we didn't like it.  Thank you for  your work, your mind, your contributions, and your DVD.  Let Freedom Ring! God's peace be with you.<br />  God is the Intelligent Designer-Creator, by Jove!<br />Sincerely,<br />Alan and Prudence Harnish<br />11-24-08"
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	"DVD disk plays OK, but the Blu-Ray disk is less than perfect even though the sleeve boasts ""perfect Hi-Def picture. Perfect Hi-Deb sound?. Maybe they just tried to load too much on it. It claims to have numerous bonus features, but getting them to play is more than tricky. I did try other Blu-Ray disks in my collection and they played just fine.<br />I think in the rush to get a copy with all of the supposedly alluring extras, Universal put out a defective product. Gave it two stars only because I can play the DVD even though I paid for and looked forward to the Blu-Ray copy. Wonder if I can return it? What do you say, Amazon?"
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	"The Movie itself was pretty much what you've come to expect from the Harry Potter Series, no doubt exciting and fun to watch, but clearly missing much from the book. As far as the movies go, this one is one of my favorites.<br /><br />However, the ""Two disc Special Edition"" was a bit of a disappointment. It came with features you might expect on standard DVDs- some deleted scenes, a tour of the set, some clips about editing the movie, and a summary of the previous films. The deleted scenes don't really add much to the experience, most of them are rather short and you can't choose which ones to play - they all play in one track. It would have been nice to see some commentary on why they were pulled, or even some bloopers added. There is no commentary whatsoever, even on the film, which was a great disappointment. The tour of the set with ""Tonks"" is entertaining, and probably the best part of the bonus disc. The video that gives a great deal of background info is helpful to those who haven't seen the first 4 movies, but it gives away too much of Order of the Phoenix to be watched before the movie. All in all, it's a bit long winded and doesn't give much new insight into the story. There's a short piece about editing, with an interactive section that lets you edit a scene, which is fairly interesting although it only lets you chose to place 3 videos in order, with a choice of 3 music tracks and 2 sound effects. It's fun, if only for a few minutes. The movie also has French and Spanish language and subtitles, which is fun for those learning one of those languages but doesn't add much to the movie. Overall, it wasn't much more expensive than the regular widescreen edition, so keep in mind you're not getting too much more."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Summary: Ben Stein doesn't understand how evolution works, so it must not be true. Also evolution is the root of anti-Semitism and Nazism! And anything we don't understand completely yet, it must be God! God is in the gaps!<br /><br />This movie is only for people who don't know anything about evolution, know it's wrong because they think their holy book say so, and know that nothing could ever change their minds.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I'm an avid HP fan.  So, I won't spend this time reviewing the movie.  The DVD is nice.  The extras are fun.  The packaging matches the previous movies.  The sound quality is great on my surround sound system.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This is a great action packed movie. The best to be produced by Marvel Studios
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"Though I'm sure I would have NEVER picked Robert Downey Jr. for the lead, this movie worked! It's so economically directed, (it's directed by Foggy Nelson himself, Jon Favreau, from the highly underrated ""Daredevil"",) and so cleverly written, you forgive any sins the movie might committ along the way, (like how did Stark manage to make that rather lethal suit of INITIAL armor, [that in the comic book series he kept for about 40 issues,] from scraps found in the woebegone Afghani desert!?! Or how can he fly around the world on the tiny cannister of fuel he carries on himself while clad as Iron Man?)<br /><br />Anyway, what you enjoy most about this movie is the clever dialogue as delivered by Downey, the wizard action sequences as the sleeker, upgraded Iron Man goes about his business, and the finally, DECENTLY done CGI special effects, (in films about Marvel heroes, the CGI is too often WOEFULLY, obviously not real, ruining the illusion and hence the full enjoyment of some of the films. Both ""Hulk"" movies and the first two ""Spiderman"" flicks being cases in point.)<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow, who has a knack for being in really good sci-fi action movies that are a cut above the pack, (""Sky Captain"",) plays Tony Stark's/Iron Man's assistant and possible love interest Pepper Potts, (can you believe that name?!) Favreau gives himself a small part as Tony's chauffeur and Jeff Bridges, (who, I must say, has aged a bit since ""The Big Lebowski""...he actually seems upper-middle-aged here!) plays an old friend of Tony's dad with an impossible biblical sounding name, Obidiah Stain, that surprises us all by the end of the film.<br /><br />I have yet to see a bad review of this movie, and it IS enjoyable, but is it because of Downey, Bridges, Paltrow, ILM or what...? It really doesn't do anything wrong, and really, isn't that what we most want from a movie...?"
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is a great movie! Highly recommend for both couples married and considering marrige. Another excellent production from Sherwood Baptist Church.<br /><br />Vince Salmela
B000H7I6CU	2.0	b	DUD-  Our family loves PIXAR movies.  We watch them often.  But no one ever picks this one.  The grandchildren who will watch movies over and over never made it to the end of this one. So thank you PIXAR for all the joyful fun and love you have given to the world before this.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	This is a great retelling of a classic story, having a darker story line with SnowWhite being the hero. I would recommend this movie if you like fairytales and fantasy type of movies.
B004JMSIRC	1.0	b	I loved iron man so much that I got it in digital format. Little did I know I couldn't use it the way I wanted too. I had to us there service download extra apps and I couldn't save it on iTunes. I could only watch it whenever I had Internet. Witch means it eats up my data package. Costing me money to stream when I shouldn't have to.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"""Iron Man"" is a really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Casting Robert Downey Jr as the very personality flawed billionaire military weapons manufacturer Tony Stark was just perfect.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, the movie follows the transformation of Tony Stark from selfish (not sure he actually changes much there) playboy to a full fledged Marvel Superhero (but as Pepper says, ""You are NOT a superhero"").<br /><br />Obviously this type of movie requires some suspension of disbelief, but the humor, action, and special effects keep the little issues way in the back of your mind.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie, Highly Recommended!"
B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	"The movie is good. The firestorm around it is nothing short of *amazing*. Unfortunately, I don't mean that latter statement in a good way.<br /><br />""Expelled"" examines the fact that much of science, academia, and the media do not stop short of simply dismissing the concepts of intelligent design (a.k.a. ID), but refuse to allow the topic to even be discussed. Hosted by Ben Stein, the movie starts with some examples of this issue. Stein admits to some early cynicism -- that this is all just over-blown hype.<br /><br />If one is objective, this cynicism is understandable. Many proponents of ID claim the name of Christ, and (unfortunately) many Christians are alarmists, self-made martyrs, and conspiracy theorists that would put Oliver Stone to shame. But sometimes, when the boy cries ""wolf"", the sheep really are in danger. In the first 20 minutes or so, ""Expelled"" shows us:<br /><br />  * professors and research scientists whose ""contracts were not renewed"" by their university (read: fired) because they pursued ID theories<br />  * an established journalist who has many of her articles vetted before publication, because she once wrote about ID in a non-dismissive way<br />  * a scientist and journal editor who lost his job simply for publishing an article written by an ID proponent<br /><br />Sadly, most of the *reactions* are the actual over-blown hype. Even more sadly, they're incredibly predictable.<br /><br />The movie uses the metaphor of the Berlin Wall, its separation of people and ideas, and its shutting out of ideas. This metaphor gets jumped on mindlessly by the film's critics, somehow taking a metaphor and twisting it to declare that Stein sees an absolute moral equivalence between the hatred and malice that spawned the Wall and the issues that he is trying to discuss. It's called an illustration, people. You learn about it in the first month of the average high school public-speaking class.<br /><br />While the film's main point is not to support ID nor defeat Darwinism, both topics are fairly unavoidable when discussing the latter's staunch hold and the shutting out of the former. As Stein notes, ""In my experience, people who are confident in their ideas are not afraid of criticism.""<br /><br />And so some of the film's scrutiny does, indeed, fall on Darwinism, and some of its suspect implications -- the criticism that Darwinists are allegedly unafraid of.<br /><br />""Expelled"" notes the fact that there are some parallels between Darwinism and Nazism, quoting some genuinely scary passages written by Charles Darwin and noting that Hitler attributed some of the theories in ""Mein Kampf"" to his reading of Darwin. Once again, the film's critics jump on the non-existent statement of moral equivalence, despite the fact that one of Stein's interviewees says point-blank that no one is saying that Darwinism leads to Nazism.<br /><br />Interestingly, I have not read a lot about the one portion of the film that I thought would generate the loudest dissent among the non-thinkers. Some of the afore-mentioned passages of Darwin nearly scream of eugenic theory (particularly when he notes -- critically -- that the human race generally does not weed out its own ""weaker"" elements). Stein then goes on to note that Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was a staunch eugenicist. Given the sacred status that abortion has been given in our society, I'm surprised that there hasn't been more outcry.<br /><br />There is some levity, too, both in the movie and the issues surrounding it. In the interviews that Stein conducted, several Darwinists admitted that Darwinism only ""begins"" once the first cell has life, and that ""no one knows"" how that first cell came to life. One scientist (and I use that term loosely) posited the theory that life began on the backs of crystals, conjuring images of Abby O'Neil (Finkelstein) from ""Dharma & Greg"".<br /><br />Stein also conducted an extensive interview with Richard Dawkins, noted author and staunch atheist. When he wasn't fumbling for answers to fairly straightforward questions, Dawkins made several convoluted statements. Stein attempted to untangle these by asking, ""So, you are willing for the theory to be disseminated that life possibly began by the 'seeding' of aliens, but you are unwilling to allow for the theory that life was first produced by a god of any nature?"" Dawkins seriously affirmed Stein's summation.<br /><br />(I'm sure that Robin Williams will be happy to know that Mork from Ork is what passes for serious science these days.)<br /><br />Interestingly, Dawkins later claimed not to know who Stein was when he granted the interview, and has stated that he would not have done the interview had he known more about Stein and/or the nature of the film. What a shame that someone who has sold hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of books is too poor to hire a 10-year-old to do a Google search. He must have a really lousy contract with his publishers.<br /><br />What I find even more fascinating is the criticism that this film has received from people who have not even seen it. And these are not just run-of-the-mill whack jobs blogging in their mom's basement. Whether it's the countless slam jobs that the film encountered before it was even shown in private screenings or even respected journalists writing in respected journals two weeks after the film's release that they haven't seen it -- and then go on to blather against it for pages -- the main point of the movie gets reinforced over and over again. Here is an issue that (theoretically) intelligent people are disinclined to discuss at all.<br /><br />You would think that such egomaniacs would be flattered that someone made a movie about them."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Really a great movie !!!<br />The vision of build strong marriage for a life is the right answer for this times, but never forget at your partner or your children or the adolescent members of your family, pray for your hearts, pray for you future, pray for your future partners and share this vision, the amazing God's Love !
B001684L0A	5.0	b	As a student of history I am aware that movies are often vague representations of the facts.  This series is one of the exceptions.  Obviously, even in a 6 hour mini-series, justice cannot be done to the life nor to the book that the movie is based upon.  I felt that emphases was placed where it should have been.  The romance between Abigail and John; the deep friendship and intense political rivalry between Adams and Jefferson; the family trials and tribulations; and the remarkable coincidence that Adams and Jefferson both died on the same day.  That was not just any day but July 4, 1826 ... the 50th anniversary of our nations birth.  Watching this movie was indeed time well spent.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Awesome movie and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect for the role. Looking forward to the second one.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I passed by this movie over & over again at the movie store. The box reminded me of some senseless kid audience type of movie. I read good things about the new one coming out this year and read the praises of the first Iron Man. I'm so glad I rented this! I love Robert Downey Jr. and he did a great job, as did Gweneth Paltrow (surprise; I'm not a fan) and Jeff Bridges. It's been a VERY long time since I've enjoyed a movie this much!<br />Anyway, this movie was a winner from the get go. It was entertaining and enjoyable right to the end. I loved it!!!<br />Buy it; rent it, but just see it; you won't be sorry!!!
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I watch this movie and found it very exciting, the effects of the movie was great!if you like this type of movie i would recommend it.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I like all of Jeff Dunham's stand up specials. I'm pretty sure I've seen all of them at this point. This is the best one. My favorite part is about how Nascar is just a bunch of guys making left turns, over and over and over again! If you are a fan of Jeff Dunham, then I highly recommend you pick it up! It's so funny I got another copy for my best friend! He and I both agree - it's AWESOME!!!!!!!!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I have seen this film and it really is an eye opener.  I bought this DVD to share with my friends.  A MUST SEE.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	The movie was great and the picture quality of the Blu-ray was excellent. When viewing it I thought I was in the theatre.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	It has been quite some time since I had HBO. When I heard all the fuss about True Blood though, I had to check it out. Living in the UK, I waited with anticipation for the first episode to air over here. I'll admit, I was really thrown off by the rather graphic sex scenes at first, I had to make sure we were watching what I thought we were watching. I'm not a prude by any means, it just threw me off. Once I got over the initial surprise though, I loved the show!!! We made it for 3 weeks before I decided I couldn't survive one episode a week and just ordered the complete season one!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	As a film buff and Robert Rodriguez apprentice, the moment I saw the trailer for this film, I knew that I had to see it. My hopes were foiled again and again by the fact that no other 13 year old, (at least one that I know), had seen the film. Five months I waited. Five months I fought for my cause. Finally, after bickering to an extreme, I convinced my mom to at least SEE the movie. Half way in, my hopes were dashed; she walked saying NO WAY. But perserverance was on my side, and I convinced her to sit through the rest. After te most agonizing 45 minutes of my life, she said the words I needed to hear.<br /><br />  I saw this morning and I am here to say...WOW. Now do not take this review the wrong way, I do not suggest this movie for MOST 13 year olds. It was full of gratuitous and, at some points, downright disturbing, violence. If your resume of films you have been allowed to see and have been unfased by include: The Passion of the Christ, Kill Bill Vol. 1, The Patriot and Saving Private Ryan, and your citizenship grades in school are consistently perfect, then PROBABLY, you should be able to see this film. If not, good luck. After all, luck was on my side.<br /><br />  And now: a general review of the film. This film is my personal new favorite film. Not because of the gratuitous violence, but because of its overwhelmingly cool nature. In my opinion, this film is one of the few modern films that is able to show that there is no good without bad, no happy without sad, no justice without SIN.<br /><br />  Sin City is a world in which the good guys aren't that good and the bad guys are far worse. Its unrealistic nature and black and white cinematography are the two things that keep the violence in check, and allow some of it to be comical. Some seens are so Robert Rodriguez, and by that I mean fantastical gunplay that brings a smile to your face. Its comic book dialogue makes it ring true to the storyline.<br /><br />  Recommendations: Once upon a Time in Mexico, Desperado, Pulp Fiction, Spiderman 2, and Batman Begins.<br /><br />  All in all, I found Sin City to be a brilliant and well-crafted film.<br /><br />  Enjoy.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"This movie never disappoints my kids, who have watched it at least 100 times.  This is actually our second copy of the movie, as the first one skips in parts due to so much use and handling by little hands.  My son calls this one ""The Dancing Cars"" because of the ""Life is a Highway"" segment.  Your kids, especially boys, will not be disappointed.  If you have a choice between ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2"" I'd definitely go with this one.  While we enjoyed Cars 2, it spends a little too much time on the whole ""Oil Companies Are BAD!"" theme for my liking.  This one is just straight up children's entertainment with no overt agenda."
B0006989TE	3.0	b	I was very impressed with the feel of the movie. It made me feel exactly the way the movie was supposed to make you feel,with a sense of peace,hope,tranquility,and no worries, a place that we all want to go when this world that we live in is going the way or is the way it is.But as we know, I dont think there can be quite a place like that without fear,death,and everything that is opposite of light or good.I thought the ending was cool, but it didnt have you saying oh my gosh with excitement as in Signs or The Sixth Sense.You know the suspence with Signs and The Sixth Sense was frighting.The little girl never finishing her water and wondering why,and then finding out in the end that it was there to destroy the alien, that was excellant story telling by the director.How about finding out Bruce Willis was a ghost all along,excellant.The Village had these components in them but not as strong.Still a good movie, but not his best.Can only wait till his next one.
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	"We just watched the newest Harry Potter movie, ""Order of the Phoenix"".  Quite frankly, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I had read at about the time the movie originally came out that it was directed by a different individual than the previous HP movies and that it tended to be ""darker"".  I found it to be not only darker and bleaker but they had also taken the fun out of this one.  I actually was anxious for the thing to end.  Too bad.  I've always liked the HP movies but if any further ones are directed by this guy, I think I'll take a pass."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"This is an intriguing and sophisticated look at the war between the South Boston Police force and its most dangerous crime ring.<br /><br />Billy Costigan (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) is allowed into the force under the condition that he will infiltrate the crime ring's inner circle as an undercover officer (the ring is led by a man named Francis Costello, played by Jack Nicholson).<br /><br />While he is working to gain Costello's trust, it becomes evident that there is a rat for Costello working on the police force (played by Matt Damon). The movie winds its way toward a bloody and penultimate conclusion.<br /><br />The movie is loaded with bad language, violence and bad values, so there's no way I would take a kid to see it. But for a grownup, it is a scary look at a world that we don't always get to see in our neck of the woods, as it were.<br /><br />My favorite character is undoubtedly the police chief (played by Martin Sheen), a devout Catholic who emerges later in the film as a Christ figure of sorts (you'll see why as the plot becomes evident).<br /><br />This is undeniably a well made movie, but it is not for the faint of heart. 4 stars.<br /><br />The movie is called ""The Departed"" because it surveys men and women on both sides of the law who have departed from God and have lost their souls, with the exception of Martin Sheen's character, who dies for one of the Departed."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	i have watched this movie several times, gave as gifts and own matching book. Both movie and book are very fun and funny. Action filled and entertaining while challenging viewer to make a reality check of their own actions and build character through perserverance, inner change, gentleness and selfless love. this book/movie is not just for troubled marriages-great for singles to assess future marriage, self growth and just fun entertainment for all.enjoy!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	This film was a real treat and something that I wanted to watch for quite some time because I admire Javier Bardem as an actor. No Country for Old Men is a thriller that delivers brilliant levels of suspense, fear and apprehension whilst simultaneously disposing of the genre's preconceived conventions. The cinematography on show unashamedly harks back to the Coens debut Blood Simple (1983) and with their regular Cinematographer at the helm, Roger A. Deakins, it is no surprise that No Country for Old Men has been nominated for an Oscar in this category. The films score is so subtle that it aids the tension by unwittingly achieving an omnipotent silence recognizable only through an assortment of wind noises which have been superbly complemented by the bleak dialogue and dark humor.<br /><br />To complement the film further it should be noted that on show here are some of the most powerful and flawless performances for some time and Tommy Lee Jones's is purely outstanding. His character embodies a demeanor of pensive sadness beautifully portrayed by the veteran actor in what is conceivably his best role to date (shocking that he has not been nominated for an Oscar, but this could be due to a lack of screen presence) it should also be noted that the final reels of the film are probably among his best ever committed to celluloid. Javier Bardem's role as the relentless and ruthless psychotic killer is astounding, his on screen presence mesmerizing and his mere appearance a pure treat along with a sense of a darkness casting over the whole room and it really makes you feel like you are in the presence of true evil. When it comes to playing a psychotic I would go so far to say that his performance has only ever been equaled by Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Hannibal Lector and maybe in years to come,<br /><br />I would like to point out that there is little to no music in the entire film which is a plus to me. The use of silence throughout the majority of the movie is very original in the sense that the music doesn't cue the viewer how to react and when.<br /><br />So again, not for everyone, but if you are a frequent movie goer and truly understand the makings of a good film, this is an excellent one to see.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did...it's undeniably worth your time.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow star in Jon Favreau's<br />2008 action film based on the comic book. A billionaire playboy turns hero<br />after creating a super-genetic suit of armor. Robert is great in this as<br />usual and this 2-disc set has nice picture and sound plus cool extras.<br />I recommend this good comic book film.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	All the people that hate Crystal Skull for its silly unrealistic nonsense, loved the first three for their silly unrealistic nonsense.  You say waterfall scene, I'll raise you Indy being taken over by an evil Hindu god, you say fridge scene, I'll raise you 900 year old knights.  The point of Indy is not to be a gritty realistic thing.  In that case we would have just seen him dieing of some degenerative disease.  Now would that have been more fun?  I think not.  Four stars: because it made me smile.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is one of the funniest comedians there is. I especially like Peanut.I would recommend it for anyone who wants real entertainment.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"Miller, Roderiguez and Tarantino combined their talents to create an amazing film. I clapped and said, ""Bravo"" after it was over. Kinda scary since I watched it by myself!! But I sincerely thought it was that good.<br /><br />It's a comic book vividly brought to life. The special effects are outrageous and over-the-top, just as they should be. It's fun to be drawn into a fantasy world that's full of action, suspense and death-defying feats.<br /><br />The use of color was both brilliant and stunning. Among other things, it purposefully spares you the gory images of brutally violent actions - just enough to remind you that it is a fictional world. But there's plenty of graphic violence and gore (among other things) ... so this most definitely isn't one for the kids!<br /><br />The cast includes dozens of actors from diverse backgrounds. Like most films Tarantino is involved in, you'll see unexpected performances from people you probably never have imagined in that role. They're given an opportunity to demonstrate their diversity and they always shine. I'm not giving Tarantino all the credit in choosing the cast, I'm just saying that I expected it when I saw his name - and I was not let down.<br /><br />I loved it."
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	I will not bore you by recapping the story or the performances, since many people appear to like assuming that role.<br /><br />However, I would like to make two observations about this and HP4.<br /><br />First, as many people have noted, there is a lot of material not included in the movie. This is inevitable given the length and all the subplots that are in the book.  However, I think they really missed something important here and in HP4 by dropping the storyline about Fred and George and their preoccupation with gags and tricks, leading to their joke shop. This could have given some much needed light hearted scenes to help counterbalance the dark and evil aspects of the movies.<br /><br />Second, is my personal belief that in most cases excessive wealth leads people (whether they are millionaire athletes, actors, or writers) to evil ways and usually the belief that they are somehow above normal humans. The first HP books were enjoyable stories with a reasonable balance of good times and bad. The later books are entirely devoted to the dark side (even if the theme is fighting the dark side) and, as such, were not nearly as enjoyable to read.  Of couse, that did not affect the author's ability to make more millions. Unfortunately, that is just they way humans are structured.<br /><br />Probably few people will agree, but there you go.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"This Movie is The Best of 2005! Every Single Second Is Amazing. This Movie is directed by an all star director named Robert Rodriguez. If you don't know him, well, you suck. And Also Directed by the creator of sin city, Frank Miller. This movie has what they like to say, ""violence"", but who cares! It's black and white! BUY THIS DVD!! Also Be ready for the long waited special edition dvd."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	A fun, witty, action movie that not only pleases iron man and comic book fans, but also the mass audience.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	The movie itself was a little bit of a let down for me. I do not think it was even close to the others in the series. The extra content on the discs was very good, I liked the alot.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Great movie and compleyed the set and was very exciting to watch easier on the eyes than the book but as with all movies the book is always better.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"From the first few minutes of Joel and Ethan Coen's film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, ""No Country for Old Men,"" I was hooked.  The opening scenes of the Texas hill country vaguely remind me of the golden beauty of Tuscany--a wild starkness sans the cypress trees that suggests the purity and serenity of an open landscape where from the beginning of time, men roamed simply because they wanted to and could. These men learned to manage not only the land--making it work for them in a symbiotic way where neither was destroyed and a careful reverent balance was maintained--but also and more importantly controlled the insidious evil that unfurled within this domain since the snake slithered into the Garden of Eden. As one of the triumvirate of main characters, Anton Chigurh, played with a succinct and taciturn cruelty by Javier Bardem, proves as he strangles his arresting officer with the very cuffs meant to restrain him, now darkness pervades; moral stability still lives on, albeit conditioned by what is thought to be lackadaisically acceptable for ""modern"" times.  Most definitely, the delicate balance once barely managed has spiraled out of the control of its sentinels.<br /><br />But what can be done about this rampant evil?  Nothing much, it seems.  We are damned if we do, and damned if we don't.<br /><br />In ""No Country for Old Men,"" the inundation of evil (call it corruptness, depravity, immorality . . .whatever) that began with less dramatically insistent indicators like the absence of manners--no longer requiring the respectful usage of `sir' and `ma'am'--or the breakdown of appropriate dress--eyesores like wearing green hair and piercing bones in one's nose--has accelerated to an intensity level where drug deals, bloody carnage and murders are commonplace.  The infringement of this darker tolerance brings with it a Pandora's box of latter day plagues that symbolically battle-worn lawmen like Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempt to clamp shut--with limited success.  One gets the sense of an overwhelming encroachment of all things bad--things that after awhile seem tame only through the conditioning of what we are told is acceptable.  Indeed, Bell knows that monsters like Chigurh are legion; wearing a marked world-weary grimace of frustration and futility on his face, he regrets, as his retirement looms, that time has outdated his methods and has matured him into the role of commentator rather than activator.  His hopes and aspirations lie now only in a field of dreams in which he must eventually awaken.<br /><br />In sharp contrast to Bell's caricature of the quintessential onlooker, Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin)--his brash economy of motion belies his way lesser rank in the war between good and evil stalks the Texas hills with the easy nonchalant grace of the antelope he hunts.  Happening upon a drug deal gone wrong and the ultimate riches-of-the-city temptation--a valise filled with money that could enrich his life with his pretty little wife (Kelly Macdonald) 2.4 million-fold, he catapults into a plan that Sheriff Bell realizes from afar will take him down.  Most of the film's action follows Moss as he attempts to outsmart the devil incarnate (the tenacious Bardem sporting a haircut reminiscent of a dark-side 70s Gerard Depardieu and his weapon of choice--a nasty little dehumanizing compressed-air-mechanized stun gun used to kill cattle.)  Minor characters pop up like targets in an arcade shooting game--mere examples of the genuine coldness of this killer and the Coen brothers' penchant for over-the-top, gory, eye-popping brutality that almost desensitizes the audience like an overexposure to the horrific behavior of Hannibal Lecter in the three Thomas Harris inspired films.<br /><br />Not only do the Coen brothers enjoy a good blood bath, they take pleasure in bitter twists of irony.  Greed motivates the good guy--Moss fights tooth and nail to keep tainted money and jeopardize his wife's security--while a bald honesty holds bad guy Chigurh in check; the strange Anton allows his victims a choice by which he religiously stands.  Oddly, for him, a promise made becomes a promise kept.<br /><br />In terms of performance, the workings of all three of the major roles here border on what seems an effortless genius.  In particular, Bardem enthralls each and every time he enters a scene wielding that oxymoronic brand of macabre attraction and repulsion is reminiscent of Anthony Hopkin's skill in portraying the murderous cannibal in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Brolin forges headfirst--his would-be sheep-for-the-slaughter a veritable thinking machine of non-stop action.  Jones brings all his wryness to this role--the character Bell seems written specifically to display the adeptness of his acting ability.<br /><br />Bottom line?  ""No Country for Old Men"" is not intended for a general audience--so parents think twice about bringing children into the theatre to see this one.  The images of bloody brutality come swiftly with little warning--I spent much of the time squeezing my eyes shut to avoid the virtual spatter of blood.  Otherwise, the film, seemingly an allegory for the eternal battle between good and evil extends beyond the obvious clouding over with nihilistic predetermination while presenting a world where conditioning to the nastier aspects of life renders all that blood-letting mere accoutrements meant to entertain rather than horrify.  Fascinating and highly recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />""reneofc"""
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Almost one hundred people have reviewed this film so far, and I can't really add much to what's been said as to the plot and quality of the film. I believe it to be the best film of 2007, and one I'd actually like to own, which is a rarity these days with all of the CGI-laden plot-poor films that fill the theaters. The Coens have always been the creators of some of my favorite modern films, with their odd choice of topics and even odder takes on those odd situations. This film is no exception. The following is the list of special features for the DVD:<br /><br />2.35:1 Anamorphic Widescreen<br />English DD5.1 Surround<br />French and Spanish subtitles<br />Working with the Coens: Reflections of Cast and Crew - Learn more about Joel and Ethan Coen from the perspective of their collaborators, cast and crew.<br />The Making of No Country For Old Men - Take a journey through the Coen Brothers' process and back to their roots as storytellers with a unique voice and vision.<br />Diary of a Country Sheriff - Explore the relationship between the compassion of Sheriff Bell and the brutality of Anton Chigurh.<br /><br />That's right - there's no commentary track. The Coen Bros. films have rarely come with very many extras.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Received the movie when expected in excellent condition.  The CD played fine with no problems.  Excellent buying experience and loved the movie!
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	This little piece of religious propaganda is only another reason why fundamentalist christianity needs to be checked in our society.<br />Intelligent Design is a complete sham, it's creationism and a conservative judge has ruled it as such. However, if you get a droll former nixon speechwriter to use the holocaust and outdated definitions of a very powerful scientific theory to make ad hominem attacks on men of science, all of a sudden ID becomes a relevant theory? Sorry, in any logic class this would fail.<br />Not to mention the filmography isn't particularly high caliber either.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	First, let me start off by saying that I'm a huge comic book fan. I'm even a big fan of some of Frank Miller's work and recognize that Batman: Year One is one of the best Batman stories ever written. That said, I hadn't read any of his Sin City stories and I definitely won't be reading them now.<br /><br />The thing that bothers me the most about the steaming pile of crap called Sin City is that it is being held up as an example of what comic books are truly about, with numerous reviewers touting it as the first authentic translation of a comic book.<br /><br />The only positive thing about Sin City was its visual style, specifically the limited and dramatic use of color against a backdrop of a black and white world. The acting was very poor, even by the big name actors. The dialogue was so cheesy it made me wince. And the story was trite, ridiculously gory and completely mysoginistic. The outcome of all the violence is also so unrealistic (with people getting shot repeatedly, blown up, being in horrific car crashes, etc., and then getting up and walking away as if nothing had happened) that I half expected Bugs Bunny to pop up at any moment. And some of the scenes were profoundly disturbing, and not in a good way (like the sick romance between Jessica Alba and her father-figure Bruce Willis).<br /><br />My friend was begging me to walk out after the first half-hour, but I stayed hoping the movie would get better because I really wanted to like the movie. I am completely baffled by the number of good reviews this movie has gotten. It's hard not to wonder if we saw the same film.<br /><br />Please don't leave this movie with the idea that this is what comic book fans like. Sin City is not at all representative of the diverse, mature works the comic industry is capable of. If you want a true example of a good adaptation of a good independent comic, go see American Splendor or Ghost World. And if you want a good example of the best that the action adventure genre of comics has to offer, go see Batman Begins instead.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	I love the direction this film takes in telling a much darker version of the Snow White tale.  The production values are top notch and it looks fantastic.  Charlize Theron is outstanding as the wicked stepmother.  The back story she's given to justify her actions made her three dimensional and far more than a stock fairytale character.  The story also takes some terrific new directions and twists while still staying loyal to the original story, particulary in regard to how the dwarves come into play, how Snow is ultimately presented with the poisoned apple and the magical kiss she receives near the end.  These were terrific new twists and I loved where the story was going...but it just didn't seem to go far enough.<br /><br />There's a huge problem with pacing.  An enormous section lags in the middle when Snow and the Huntsman are wandering through the woods.  This seems to go on FOREVER, while the most interesting character, the queen is off-screen for FAR too long.  While Hemsworth is terrific and perfectly cast in his role, he's given virtually nothing to do but be Snow's chaperone through the whole story.  He's a great actor, and his character is given a solid backstory but it's never fully implemented into the plot.  Likewise, we're led to believe the Huntsman and Snow have developed a certain depth to their relationship by the end but there is absolutely NO evidence to support this change of heart.  Nothing.  The prince of the kindgom, overthrown by the wicked queen, is also trying to find Snow in the woods.  He loved her in his childhood and is desperately trying to locate her.  There was a TERRIFIC opportunity here to create a love triangle between the prince, huntsman and Snow that was completely ignored.<br /><br />Lastly, the biggest drawback of the film is Stewart.  Everything this girl does is delivered in a deadpan, disaffected tone with eyes hanging at half-staff.  She is so flat on screen and exudes ZERO energy that the times she's on screen (85% of the time), the move's momentum grinds to a hault.  It's VERY difficult to watch her and stay engaged because it seems, she's not either.<br /><br />Having said that, I'd still recommend it for the clever twists, Theron and Hemsworth's performances and some of the most gorgeous productions values I've seen in quite a while.  I loved where this film was headed but it seemed that the screenplay needed a couple of more drafts, a tightening of the story and more character development.  It's like they went ahead and filmed a first draft script.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I have to admit when I first saw this movie and it came out I didn't get it.  I didn't like it either, for some reason it just didn't fit my tastes.  Yeah it was cute and everything, but it didn't grab my attention.  Maybe because I wasn't really interested in it at the time.<br /><br />Once my first child became two years old, she was really into Cars (not per se the movie but the actual cars like Hot Wheels) and well I was looking for something for her to watch on a movie in the dvd player in the van.  I came across Cars the movie once again.  Boy did she love it!  This is the only movie that my daughter can watch about 3-4 times and beg for more of and I have grown to love this movie too.<br /><br />The animation of this movie is outstanding, far surpasses a lot of what pixar has done and makes me feel like driving through Arizona sometime soon just to see it in person.  The storyline is funny and the characters are funning and loving.  The message that the movie sends is very heartwarming in which a car finds who he really is.  The music goes great with the movie and one thing that I really love about the movie is every time you watch it, you see something you didn't before.  Something that Pixar put that you didn't notice until you saw it a little bit closer.<br /><br />For example, Sally hits Luigi when she is talking to Mcqueen, there are tire tracks in the sky when they are racing in the dirt, etc...it's neat to see how they put hidden stuff in there like that.<br /><br />If you saw this movie once and didn't like it, I recommend to watch it again and see for yourself.  I love it now and sit down with my daughter when she watches it.  It's one of Pixars best and I wish they would make another one, but they don't like to do sequels.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This has to be one of his funniest skits yet. I laughed so hard my sides hurt for days. I highly recommend this video.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This item purchased for my grandchildren is a wonderful film for not only children, but for all ages. This particular film had been used at my Church as a film for a night out with the children. It was enjoyed by all..
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	This movie has energy. Keeping you somewhat off-kilter and unsure where things are headed. This twisting, turning tale blazes its exciting, funny, with a brutal path. A must see movie.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	what can i say!? if you're a fan of true blood, like me, you HAVE to own the dvds! that's all there is to it. i can watch this sexy, campy, oh so southern series over and over and never tire of it! it appeals to a range of ages - from precocious teens to hip parents and grand parents! (yes, i know of more than one grandmother who loves true blood!)<br />so i suggest you order this first season, sit yourself down, settle in and get ready for a wild ride! i, for one, CANNOT WAIT until season two is released! love anna paquin, love stephen moyer, love love love vampire eric!
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	"I agree with most that claim this movie should have been longer. There are several scenes that introduce a plot line then leave it hanging. Without getting my soap box out I just say that they need to re-edit this one and get more content in it. There's just too much missing and the story is lost because of that.<br /><br />My real gripe is the DVD transfer quality. Viewed as 480I this DVD may look OK (but just OK). Any upscaling player will reveal the horrid transfer quality. It looks like the DVD was deliberately blurred in some scenes. I can see what look like digital mask artifacts in the DVD. I reviewed Goblet of Fire and the picture was fine at 1080P upscale.<br /><br />""Good"" movie but real let down in the quality of the DVD."
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Kristen Stewart is pretty terrible, and she's on screen almost the entire movie. The visuals are stunning, however. Overall, this is skippable but not quite a waste of time.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	I'm a huge HP fan, and this movie was a little disappointing.  I'll stick to reviewing the product, however, and not the movie itself.  2 DVDs in a pretty box seems real exciting, until you watch the not-so-special features.  I expected more.  I expected less cheese.  And why are they acting like what happens in the next two movies is a mystery?  Um, hello, we've read the books.  Maybe I'm expecting too much from a kids' movie.  But don't they know by now that kids aren't the only fans?
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	"""Your going to give youself a heart attack if you think about it. Just eat it"" Jared Edinger (childhood friend)<br /><br />  Well when I was seven years old that worked pretty well at getting me to shut my mouth at his fathers bad cooking and just eat it. Now that I'm an adult I would rather not eat poison, and I most certainly don't want to feed it to my children (as a side note my childhood friend feeds his children much better than his dad fed him as well). Food INC. is nothing short of eye opening, jaw dropping, in your face proof that the food industry is not to be trusted. Not only is our food supply tainted with bacterial killers while the industry refuses to truly fix the problem, but we are being sold poor health as well. Farmers are being told to raise chickens in a certain way which they know is not healthy for the chicken or for us. Cattle are being raised on corn based feed that promotes ecoli growth, and they are being kept in unsanitary conditions which also can impact our health. They industry has created soy beans that are immune to round-up (you know so they can spray that same round up on the crops to kill the weeds but not the soy beans). They are shaking down farmers to force them to buy their hybred crops or be eliminated from the market, and forced into bankruptcy. The amount of eye opening scenes come one after another.<br /><br />  This review can't do this film justice. However, if I were to come up with one thing I didn't like it is the scenes that pander the pro union message. I don't really care if you like unions or not. I just don't feel it added anything to the film."

B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This workout is amazing. No matter how many times you've been through the videos, you will sweat. Its a bit hard on the knees, ankles and wrists, so steer clear if these are sensitive spots for you. I love doing it, the time commitment each day isn't too huge, but the payoff is awesome. I'm three weeks in and have already see results, the muscle definition that is starting to happen is very exciting. In two weeks I start the 1 hour sessions which will be even more insane.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Never heard him before, it was free with prime so I thought why not.. glad I watched it. Thanks for the laughs :)
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This workout is definitely everything it's hyped up to be...insanity.  My wife and I have been completing the workouts day by day and we're still hanging in there after 3 weeks.  I highly recommend this product if you're healthy enough and able to stretch properly before and after each workout.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Really enjoyed the movie. the video quality was great. enjoyed the plot twist, Kristen Stewart actually did a descent job in this movie.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE AND I GOT A GREAT DEAL ON THIS PRODUCT. aMAZON IS A GREAT PLACE TO SHOP FOR ALL THE THING THAT YOU NEED AT A BETTER PRICE RATE. I WOULD RECOMMEND AMAZON TO ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	As other reviewers have noted, by necessity a lot of book 5 is left out of this movie, in order to keep the length manageable, but I think that is OK. Just watch it as a movie in a movie series, not as a play-by-play of the book, and you will be able to appreciate it. The focus is on the most essential aspects of the story - the growing threat of Voldemort, the denial of the ministry and media to accept this, including their smearing of Potter and Dumbledore, the evolution of the Order of the Phoenix, the growing authoritarian repression at Hogwarts under Professor Umbridge, and Harry's struggles with Voldemort's increasing presence in his mind. That's  A LOT to cover, and the movie does it well.<br /><br />This is a dark movie - the death of Cedric at the end of book and movie 4 marks the turning point in this series. From this point forward it is an out-and-out battle between good and evil, and the darker mood - and look - of this film reflects that. There is a lot of tension, and a lot of repressed (and expressed) anger, in the form of Umbridge, and, of course, Harry. Everyone is struggling to come to terms with what is happening, and many are denying it. Harry's status as an outsider is cemented, and yet, he rediscovers the importance of love and friendship in the form of Dumbledore's Army. This is a lot of psychoological complexity, coupled with adolescent angst, and everyone manages to pull it off.<br /><br />The final climactic scene, in which Dumbledore helps Harry 'expel' Voldemort from his mind, is critical to understanding the themes of this entire series, and I think it is done justice here. That in and of itself is enough to make me love this movie. So my advice is to forgive what is not covered, and assess it according to what is really most important to the series - if everything had been put in, some of the subtler scenes that drive the psychological drama would have been more rushed. Choices were made, and it's all to the good in my view.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Soooooooo funny. I'm getting this so my friends and I can watch it over the holidays.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"this was by far the darkest chapter in the harry potter series yet.it reminded me of ""empire strikes back"" or ""revenge of the sith"" in that it was a family film that took a very dark turn.<br />  the kids have to carry around a trinket for a while that makes them turn on eachother.it reminded me of ""lord of the rings"" and the hobbitts with the ring.<br />  it was not my favorite part.my favorite part was ""prisoner of azkaban"".although,i would rank it in the top half along with ""the half blood prince""<br /><br />  i say it is a good movie.the only harry potter movie to be my favorite for an entire year.yes the movie industry is going to crap but this was still the winner.<br />  now id like to address all the ill informed misfits out there about something.i hear a lot of people saying that harry potter is evil.they say just because the kids are at a school learning magic,that they must be satanic.well,magic is magic and satanism is satanism .they are 2 entirely different things.some of the wiccans and celts and such belive there isnt even a devil at all.others still belive that he is real but they belive he is pure evil and they sure as crap dont worship him.any idiot in the multiverse knows that.so i say to these uninformed misfits....GET A LIFE AND THEN AN EDUCATION.......ITS this same of short cuts to thinking that caused the inquisition.<br />  its just a bunch of family movies.nothing to run away from.kids playing with sticks and casting spells that make spiders walk on roller skates and stuff."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	5 stars all the way !  This documentary is informative, captivating and you will learn the truth about how our government operates. Public offices which police and sign food industry laws have been infiltrated by industry lawyers and lobbyist who now hold these government positions in Washington, truth be told... the government works for the food industry and not the people! This movie is a must see.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Wanted to see this film yet again and found a copy of the Special Edition Steelbook DVD at a great price from one of the associates here on Amazon. Decided on the DVD edition because it includes the bonus ""Scorsese On Scorsese"" piece that is, apparently, not on the Bluray edition. Highly recommended."
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	The movie was delivered quickly and the dvd looked buffed but it skipped in a few places. I opted not to return it but I was a little disappointed that it didn't play a bit better.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	This movie was entertaining and had a few good scenes. It wasn't a movie that I would have wanted to watch in theater but it is a good watch for at home. Recommended for a rainy or hang on the couch kinda day.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	I was sent BlueRay when there was no mention of choice.  Therefore, totally useless.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I loved CARS, it has amazing animation, good story, even though it is a bit slow in the middle, I think the pace could have been tightened up a bit. Not as good as PIXARS best film THE INCREDIBLES. BUt I realy enjoyed this film.<br /><br />So many CGI film today can't come close to story and quality of animation of a PIXAR film. Disneys first try, Chicken little fell short, just not a good complex story, not saying it isn't fun, just not good enough.<br /><br />And finally, why do they continue to release movies in FOOL-SCREEN (fullscreen). It destroys the movie and what the director wanted you to see.<br /><br />Do people actually realize they cut off the side of the movie to make it fit your square tv. I work for a national retailer, who's log is made of big red circles. I love when someone comes in to get a movie and it is ONLY in widescreen and they have to buy a widescreen movie. When I tell then that a 2:35 aspect ratio movie cuts off HALF the movie and I show them it on a TV. Alot of people are switching to widescreen now.<br /><br />If people quit buying fullscreen they will stop making them,
B0006989TE	5.0	b	This is one of those rare movies that is well written, acted, and beautifully portrayed. It holds your interest throughout.  The music ties it all together perfectly.  I highly recommend it.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I received this product on time and in perfect condition.  I order a ""like-new"" and the product was actually brand new and still had the plastic seal.  I completed Day 1 this morning and while it was hard I am looking forward to tomorrow's workout and getting in shape."

B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	Has anyone realized that the DVD version has many missing parts to it?  In the theatre, just in the beginning alone for example, where is the part where the blonde interviews Starke before they end up in bed together?  What about the Casino part where he completely doesn't show for his award?  What about all the witty commentary btwn Starke and the army squad driver/passengers??  I understand that there are deleted/extended scenes included on the DVD, BUT, I thought those were scenes that were extras that were never part of the original movie.  Am I wrong in this??????  ALSO, even some of the deleted scenes were cut!  So some of the movie that I saw in the theatre just plain doesn't even EXIST on the DVD!  Is it a different story on the double disk edition or blue ray version??  They all claim to be a 125 minute play time so what the heck??  Someone enlighten me b/c I LOVED this movie in the theatre and I am very disappointed that I don't get the full version on my DVD!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I love this work out, it definitely works to make you stronger and be fit. Definitely not for beginners, you have to be moderately active to try this otherwise it's  a very hard workout.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I ordered Iron Man for my husband for Valentine's day.  It arrived on Valentine's, but it was just an empty DVD case.  While initially quite upset, I contacted the store and was pleased that the representative was both quite apologetic and very proactive.  They said they'd sent out a replacement DVD first thing the next day.  Now, only four days later, I have the new copy.  It's in perfect condition and the original DVD at a more than reasonable price.

B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	IRON MAN went way beyond my expectations. I was blown away. Robert Downey Jr. is incredible. He seems to get better with each film he makes. He makes Iron Man and true to life hero despite the implausibility of it all. He literally gives this character heart (no pun intended). IRON MAN is a thoroughly entertaining film thanks to a great script and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. I like the way the film makers updated the setting and integrated the origin of Iron Man into the current socio-political situation in the Middle East. I was totally surprised how good this film was. This is one you just have to see. It entertains but works on such an emotional level and  that's what really makes it work.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	great movie, really enjoyed the plot.......  so suprised at the end of the movie!

B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	HARRISON FORD BY THE AGE THAT HE IS, HE IS STILL MAKING EXCELLENT MOVIES, AND REMEMBER THAT THIS IS THE ORIGINAL ACTOR OF INDIANA JONES. I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE COULD BE A REPLACEMENT FOR HARRISON FORD. THIS LAST MOVIE OF INDIANA JONES IS THE BEST TO WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"I've heard--and read--so many disparaging remarks regarding superhero movies, as if they're somehow inferior to ""real"" movies--what is a REAL movie, anyway? A low-budget indie full of miserable people? I think the characterization in Iron Man, like the Spider-Man franchise, is very good. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark/Iron Man. No one else could have brought this character to life as he has. The supporting cast is excellent. The story is true to the comic book--or is it ""graphic novel"" now? I'm never quite sure! The story never bogs down. The special effects are spectacular. Marvel was wise to take the reins on this one.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars instead of five because I was disappointed to find, in all the extras included in the 2-disc set, there was no BLOOPER REEL!!!!"
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	What a waste of money.  Some effects good, others cheesy.  Nothing original, every action secquence was cliche.  And I paid for this stinker.  All hype no depth.  Ugghhh  I got ripped off.  R. Scott should be ashamed.  Worse than a Lucas rehash.

B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	Thought it was better ,good graphics but predictable ,glad I waited for it to come out on dvd maybe if Kristen Stewart ,focused more on her acting instead of other things lol she would have done a better job
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I was this movie in IMAX 3D first, and let me tell you, it was flat out amazing.  The 3d effects are the best I've seen so far, and this film makes very good use of IMAX technology.  I then saw it about a week later in an ordinary movie theater.  Good, but it wasn't even the same experience as in IMAX.  When the train comes, the IMAX theater shook.  See this movie, it's a christmas classic.  And if at all possible, see it in IMAX 3D, it's well worth the trip.  IMAX 3D brings out the best in this film.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"Happy endings are not always happy, and seeing with clarity does not always mean a pretty picture.  Sin City relentlessly drives home the message that no good deed goes unpunished!  In the ""down in the heel"" Basin City, To win is to lose, the villians are irredeemable and the heros are not people you want to meet in a dark alley either.  The stories are white knuckle tense and the film noir expertly enhances the clash between villains, heros and anti-heros. Even ""The Crow"" did not have guts this hard.  If you are in to gothic noir, Sin City is the movie to see."
B0006989TE	5.0	b	I still love it!!!<br /><br />  I know people whom actually enjoyed this besides me, even though the majority hate it... I think as far as M. Night Shamalan goes, besides Sixth Sense, this is his best... I know you may think I'm crazy, bit it is...<br /><br />  The reason so many people didn't enjoy it, is simply because it wasn't brainless, and although EVERYTIME Hollywood produces a brainless film, idiots complain, they still fare better than this did... You gotta giveM. Night points for originality at least... If you've seen it... It was a clever premise, set-up, and climax... Despite what 60% of the people say... They're just looking for gobbledeegook...<br /><br />  Well, I can't say anything about the film without ruining it, but... If you enjoy movies that are thinking movies, but at the same time, you can sit back and enjoy... This is one of them... After, seeing it three times, I still enjoy it... It has to have some of the most georgeous cinematography, and one of the best film soundtracks ever recorded, because it enhances everything about the movie and is absolutely georgeous on its own... The violin is exquisite!!! :)<br /><br />  My point is, I think if you come in with low expectations, and appreciate films that transcend above the normal hollywood dreck, this is one of them... I'd give it a solid 4.5....<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"Miller was more than reluctant to see his novels (in comic book form) get made for the screen. After all, he'd worked long and hard to get his own series so why hand over the reins to someone else? Word is, he resisted tons of offers until finally he was convinced by a very persistent director, who went so far as to film a trial scene, complete with the ACTUAL ACTORS to be used in the movie. That did the trick.<br /><br />Okay, so that is a fine backstory but what about the film itself? Does it live up to expectations?<br /> Yes, and more so...just don't be surprised by the graphic nature of the film. Those familiar with Miller's work won't be - it is those who aren't who may have to make a few adjustments in their expectations, although I think they'll be entranced from the opening scenes.<br />  The plot is pretty much as you'd expect from a movie based on a Miller book. Murder, revenge, love, lust and corrumption everywhere. The world so gritty that you feel like showering after you leave the theatre, convinced the dust and grime are so thick that they HAVE to had escaped the screen. The film noir atmosphere is so thick that it makes for a heady experience, especially if, like me, you are a huge fan of film noir.<br /> If it sounds like I""m holding back on the plot details, I am..because viewers really need to come to this movie with fresh eyes, open to a new experience. You won't be disappointed but this movie won't be for everyone. Check out the word of mouth first, especially from people whose opinions you trust. My group loves this one.<br /><br />One of the most creative and innovative movies of the year, so far."

B000H7I6CU	3.0	b	There's really nothing wrong with this; it fits the mold as a smart kid's movie with enough subtle nudges and winks to keep the adults happy, a formula that Pixar has mined extremely well over the past decade and a half. It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.

B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	This movie will be rated R, one of the most anticipated blockbusters to have that in awhile.  Ridley is not selling out on this one for increased ticket sales to tweens and kids.  You've gotta respect that.  I'm seeing it opening weekend.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"2008 gave us three excellent superhero films: The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk.....and Iron Man. Director Jon Favreau truly did his homework while researching Marvel Comics' high flying superhero, and it shows. I think i was one of the very few who thought it would be tragic if there were missteps to putting Iron Man to the big screen. I mean, for every Spiderman or X-Men 2, theres a Ghost Rider or original Punisher. But Favreau understood the appeal and complexities of billionaire Tony Stark, and took what was considered by some to be a second tier character and gave him three dimensional authenticity.<br /><br />For starters, lets not forget Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, who created Iron Man in ""Tales of Suspense # 39"" in the early 60s. Theirs is the blueprint from which this film sprang. It is soooo faithful to the origin of the character, despite modernizing certain elements, which i was totally fine with, since it made total sense: Instead of Vietnam, we see Stark captured in Afghanistan. Instead of a jungle warlord, we have members of a Taliban-type organization, yet the weapons manufacturing angle remains intact. We see Stark's interaction and subsequent friendship with fellow inventor/prisoner Yinsen, well played by Grant Toub. The moment when Stark creates and puts on his original, bulky silver suit of armor had me grinning from ear to ear, blasting his way from captivity<br /><br />As he returns to America, Stark, who was a munitions manufacturer for the U.S. military, decides to change his views on weapons of war and instead use his gifts to battle those who threaten the oppressed, here as well as overseas.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr is the engine that drives this film from beginning to end, and hes brilliant. Anyone who knows the character of Stark from the comic books knows hes an at times arrogant, shallow playboy who enjoys his drink and his women. Downey has him down pat and his transformation from selfish, wealthy jerk to a slowly caring humanitarian/hero is peppered with humor and wit. The times we see him designing his suits of armor, through trial and error, mostly error, are funny, yet we see the human being in him with a newfound cause, and the moment in the film when he travels back to Afghanistan, as Iron Man, and wages war on his former captors as they terrorize innocent villagers, will make you jump up and down.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, one of my favorite actors of all time, plays Obediah Stane, who runs Stark Industries with Tony and acts as father figure to our hero until we discover his true nature and motivations concerning continuing their weapons division. He's a great bad guy. Even Gwyneth Paltrow delivers fun work as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant. This is the only time i can say i enjoyed watching her on screen, and shes actually fun to watch in her playful interactions with Downey.<br /><br />Tight direction from Favreau, a great screenplay, excellent special effects and a fun, multi-faceted performance from the multi-talented Downey makes ""Iron Man"" one of the better superhero adaptations to come along in a while.<br />Loved it."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I enjoyed Sin City in the movie theater.  It has excellent performances by a multitude of stars and accurately captures the style and substance of Frank Miller's ""graphic novels.""<br /><br />Yes, it is a ""film noir"" in the extreme and full of gore and violence.  But if you watch it as it is intended -- a larger than life cartoon portrayal -- I think you will enjoy it.<br /><br />I watched the movie again in DVD when it was first released and enjoyed it even more on the second watching as I ""got"" more of the story line the second time around.  Still the original release DVD disappointed due to its lack of special features.<br /><br />The Recut, Extended, Unrated edition more than makes up for the disappointing originial DVD release.  Perhaps most impressive is the presentation of the separate tales in separate segments as they were told in the original Miller works.  This allows each to stand on its own and the addition of more and clarifying footage.  One sees how each story relates to the others in a different way than in the theater version in which the separate stories are intertwined througout the feature.<br /><br />The commentary by directors Rodriguez and Miller is excellent are all the other special features.<br /><br />If you haven't already bought the original DVD, skip it and buy this version.  You won't regret it, especially if you are a fan of the genre."
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	This movie had almost nothing to do with the fact that the husband was a fire fighter. Like others, I was picturing a Ladder 49 type of movie. Definitely not the case. The acting in this movie has to be the WORST acting I have ever seen. It was painful to watch ! With such a good title I expected this movie to be great and was greatly disappointed. I understand the message the movie was trying to get across, but they did it in a very poor manner.  Some of the parts that were trying to be religious were ridiculous -- when the lady was eating lunch and stopped talking in the middle of conversation to pray, it was SO cheesy. And just like that part, nothing in this movie felt real. You don't ever feel the relationship between Catherine and her husband, its like strangers fighting. This movie is garbage. Seriously all the ' Fireproof your marriage ' hype must be based off of the books or something because I just can not imagine so many people being so obsessed with such a lame movie.

B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	I was somewhat disappointed in the length/scope of this movie as compared to the others. It cannot be compared to the book. A good movie if you've no expectations.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"I really liked this film. It's the best Marvel Comics movie yet. As a long time comic book fan, I find this movie fascinating for how it combines elements of the original comics with new takes on the character, all to perfectly capture his essence.<br /><br />Iron Man first appeared in 1963. Stan Lee who created the character and wrote his early adventures makes no secret of the fact that Tony Stark was originally based on Howard Hughes. I'm not talking the later, paranoid, mentally unhinged, obsessively germophobic, hasn't-trimmed-his-fingernails-or-taken-bath-in-five years Howard Hughes, I'm talking the young, amazingly good looking, high-level genius, kinda-looks-ike-Errol-Flynn-and-bonks-any-gorgeous-Hollywood-starlet-he-wants-to Howard Hughes.<br /><br />The early parts of the movie pretty much follow the 1963 origin. While in a foreign country supporting the American war effort (in 1963 it was Vietnam and doing a field review of Stark-designed weapons' performance, in 2008 it's updated to the War on Terror and hawking the Jericho missile system), Tony Stark is severely wounded in an explosion, a piece of shrapnel lodged near his heart that will in weeks work itself inward and kill him. Imprisoned with Professor Yinsen (originally Vietnamese, natch, in the movie not) they work together to free themselves from the evil warlord who has imprisoned them both. Tony builds an armored chest plate that will keep the shrapnel from piercing his heart, and around that he and Yinsen design and build a crude suit of armor, somewhat paradoxically inset with all the cutting edge technological weaponry that a high-level genius intellect, feverishly battling for freedom and against death, can invent when pushed to the edge under incredible time pressure. Tony uses the first, bulky, prototype Iron Man armor to escape but Yinsen dies in the attempt.<br /><br />Stan Lee always felt that every good hero, no matter how powerful, should have a counterbalancing weakness. In Tony's case it's the damage to his heart, and the irony (pun intended) that the Iron Man armor (or at least the chest plate of same) is not just there to be his superheroic identity, it's a necessity to keep him alive. Tony can never take off the chest plate, he has to wear it constantly, hidden under his clothes when not Iron Man, openly when he is. Eventually this goes away when Tony's damaged heart is removed and replaced with a cybernetic heart of his own design. Overtones of the Wizard of Oz's Tin Man without a heart do occur to me.<br /><br />But...I get ahead of myself. Back to the early comic books, and the movie's storyline.<br /><br />When Tony returns to the world, in short order, having seen and felt the ravages of war up-close and personal, he terminates Stark Industries' production of war materiel. Up til this point, the movie is pretty much a well-produced updating of the original story.<br /><br />The rest of the movie skips ahead and pillages ideas from Iron Man stories of decades later, specifically Iron Man's conflict with Obadiah Stane who starts out as Stark's business rival and eventually dons a set of armor called Iron Monger to become Tony's armored antagonist. (Iron Man is always at his best when he's battling high-tech armored villains with suits to pit against his own.) In the movie Stane is recast as Tony's business partner and paternal figure after his own father's death.<br /><br />We do skip in the movie the iterations of Iron Man armor between the first gray suit and the most current versions which are visually based on Japanese samurai armor, very techno-geek manga-esque. In particular we skip the sleek design that Stark wore longer than any other suit, and for me has always been THE classic Iron Man.<br /><br />Pepper Potts was an early cast member who then disappeared for decades before eventually being reintegrated into the Iron Man mythos. James Rhodes (Rhodey), though retconned as one of Stark's oldest friends, was actually a much later addition to the series, not first appearing until the late 1970s. They both work well as supporting characters in the movie. The robot Jarvis, for those who aren't comic book fans and thus don't get the little in-joke, is a play on the long running character of the Avengers' butler, Englishman Edwin Jarvis.<br /><br />The linchpin of the film is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark. When I first heard of his casting, it was from a guy bitching about what a BAD idea he thought it was. ""Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, that's just ridiculous."" I said slowly as I thought about it, ""Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark....that's just F--KING BRILLIANT. Perfect casting."" And it was. Downey Jr. can play an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high-IQ addict (I've heard it said we'll get into Tony's alcoholism in the second film) because he is in fact an incredibly good looking, talented, fast talking, charming and charismatic, high-IQ addict. It's tempting to say that Robert Downey Jr. was born to play this role."

B0006989TE	5.0	b	"Mr Shyamalan is a great director. People often do stupid sentences as ""a scary director"" or ""a funny director"" or whatever. Great Directors made just beautiful movies. Forget the past. Forget ""Sixth sense"" and ""Signals"". Just watch this film without pre-ideas, it's just marvellous."
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	"MOVIE REVIEW #35 : "" Snow White and the Huntsman ""<br /><br />Making his directorial debut, Rupert Saunders takes a long look at one of the very first original Grimm's Brothers fairy tales and tries hard to give it a new spin. Evan Daugherty (Killing Season), Hassien Amini (Drive, Jude) and also writer/director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, The Rookie) try and give the script a new modernized twist from original story. Unfortunately it moves very slowly and goes nowhere and often leaves you wondering where they are actually taking you next. I can see why this film pushed back its release date a couple times.<br /><br />Of course the visuals are interesting and detailed, the costumes clever and inventive and cinematography almost gothic in nature - but the bottom line - the story takes a while to become one - an actual story. There's a new spin on everything from the `magic mirror', the poison apple and even the forest animals and fairies. (Which were the most visually stimulating for the eye!)<br /><br />Now casting must have been a tough one, but given that she didn't have a whole lot to do (or say), Kristen Stewart (Twilight, Into The Woods) gives a somewhat subdued performance in a fairly dark film. As does Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek-2009, Thor) who is the Huntsman on a somewhat altered mission from the original tale. And, the two of them did not seem to connect - `chemically' for me.<br /><br />Charlize Therone (Monster. Hitchcock) plays the `evil' Witch. Now although she was extremely expressive in her desire to be evil - she wasn't looking like she enjoyed what she was doing. Bitter and spiteful and not evil for the sake of being evil, Therone didn't seem like she was having any fun with a role that didn't have to be over-the-top - but at least interesting enough to make me believe she loved and desired to do what she was doing.<br /><br />For me, the stand out performances came from the smaller but poignant characters - like Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook)play one of the eight dwarfs who is blind. His words of wisdom and `insight' actually explain and drive the story when things actually started happening. Also, Sam Spruell (The Hurt Locker, Defiance) play the evil Witch's brother who seems to deviously delight in his quest to find Snow White after she runs into the dark forest. Fighting and re-fighting Hemsworth many times.  Both Bob and Sam are engaging to watch when they are on screen. Sam Claflin (Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Untied) played a long acquainted childhood friend of Snow's who really made a connection with his duel mission as directed by the evil Queen.<br /><br />Another plus for me was the representation of the Black Forest. Extremely creepy and true to the Brothers Grim original tale, the imagination of the forest attacking a person became visually scary. Also, the beauty and grace of the hidden forest, the forest animals inside this area and especially the fairies that occupied the plants, trees and animals = were quite stunning to watch. The special effects have come a long way to making the fantasy seem very real.<br /><br />Overall...it is a long film, that is short of moving the story along and long on fighting and action sequences of hand to hand and horse to horse combat. The relationships have a new twist to them and be prepared to get a new really big twist on this old tale at the end of the film.<br /><br />Definitely a family friendly film, however a little weak in the story and characterization department - I would wait for the DVD, online or rent it - Snow White didn't have the passion I was expecting."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This is a great gift set.  We love having a DVD copy and a Blu-Ray.  The Cars that come with the movie are very high quality.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"I'll start out with the extras, since everyone has already talked about the film. As for the 6 alternate scenes, all 15 minutes were fun to watch. I think the only scene completely dropped was the one where those two guys that got lost on the alien ship, find the snake-like shedded skin. The alternate scenes were either slightly longer versions of the original scenes (like the Christmas tree), or completely rewritten scenes (like the sex scene, when Noomi gets pregnant with an alien.) The 5.1 mix was well done, however the mixers played bizarre games with the dynamics. Since Prometheus is a ""rock movie"", you have to play it LOUD. I have 15"" Woofers, and they couldnt reproduce the Prometheus' lift-off sound without distorted rumbling. If you dont play this soundtrack thru a fairly good Home Theater sound system, I'm afraid you'll get a lot of distortion during the loud portions of the film. (The storm, the liftoff, orchestral swells, etc.)<br /><br />As for the film itself, visually its simply stunning. The overlay of intricate CGI provides the alien ship an oppulent, fairy tale quality. However, the Prometheus ship is all clean lines and white walls. Quite the opposit from the first Alien movie's earth ship, with its dark, threatening, industrial design. The Alien space ship in PROMETHEUS, is hands down the creepiest, most realistic depliction of an Alien craft ever created on film. In that sense, Ridley Scott surpased his masterpeice, ALIEN. But the visuals at times are so intricate and overlayered they confuse the eye. And the plot does the same--confuse and overwhelm. Just how many DIFFERENT aliens exist in this film? How many forms does each alien morph thru? How many cast members got infected this time? Four? Add to that the infected Alien, plus the dead aliens that were infected 2000 years ago. You need a flow chart to figure out whats going on.<br /><br />Apparently the complex plot sets up the next two films. That's good to know. Maybe we'll find out why that Alien drinks acid and melts at the beginning of the movie. When all's said and done, PROMETHEUS is a complex, visually stunning cinematic achievement. I cant place it at the same level of ALIEN, but only ""2001"" and ""StarWars"" sit that high. My only regret is that I bought the cheapest version. For a few more dollars, I could have had the Blue ray DVD too, plus more features."
B0006989TE	2.0	b	This movie presents itself as a unique, genuine scare/thriller, but what you get is a slow-paced dud with an obvious, predictable plot. The acting/dialogue is tedious and at times painful to hear, the storyline dead-ends in the middle of the movie; overall, this is not worth your time or money.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Martin Scorsese has another major hit on his hands with the release of the intelligent, chilling, violent, puzzling, and completely fascinating THE DEPARTED.  This viewer has not seen the INFERNAL AFFAIRS on which this film is based so comparisons are not possible.  But taking this film solely on its own merits this is one gripping piece of cinematic art.  Beginning with a very smart script by William Monahan (apparently based on the original screenplay by Siu Fai Mak) and employing one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Scorsese does what he does best in giving us a film that holds our attention, our breath, and our applause throughout.<br /><br />The story involves two young recently graduated from police academy, men from opposite sides of the law and backgrounds, who are made moles within the Boston State Police department and the Irish mafia: Leonardo DiCaprio is one and Matt Damon is the other and both young actors turn in committed and convincing performances.  On the polar aspects of the battleground are Jack Nicholson as the crime king Costello (his finest work since 'A Few Good Men') together with Ray Winstone as Mr French and on the other end are DiCaprio's mentors Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg and Damon's mentors Alec Baldwin et al.  The very beautifully written female lead is played to perfection by Vera Farmiga who finally has a role (a conflicted psychiatrist for the moles) hat takes full advantage of her prodigious gifts as an actress.<br /><br />Some may find the violence obsessively graphic, but then this is Scorcese's style and for this viewer it is necessary for the drive of the story.  It is impossible to stop concentrating for a moment during this rapid fire drama, spiced with just the right amount of wry humor, making its running time (in excess of two and a half hours) speed by as fast as the many bullets in the atmosphere.  This is one of Scorsese's best films and one that begs to be seen again.  Grady Harp, October 06
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	For me, this was an odd movie.<br /><br />First, it was dark.  Almost every scene was either dark blue or dark brown, with only glimpses of sun.<br /><br />I realize this is thematic, and symbolizes the dark, almost impossible predicament, the three principals (Harry, Hermione, Ron) are in.<br /><br />Second, it almost entirely lacked the interesting subordinate characters that made the previous Harry Potters so lively: Snape, Voldemort, Dumbledore, Luna, the Malfoys, the rest of the Weasleys, etc., etc. do appear, but briefly--then they are gone.<br /><br />Also thematic, I realize: the isolation and loneliness are deliberately claustrophobic, and intensify the fears and hopelessness of the Big 3.<br /><br />Still, these give the film a closed-in, deprived feel, that, however thematic, make it seem thin and strained.<br /><br />Third, the wedding is given short shrift, while the jealousy-theme goes on interminably.<br /><br />Also thematic, I know: this is the story of growing up, and all the melodrama and angst of being a teenager.<br /><br />Still, all this indicates that the Epic Good-vs.-Evil conflict has taken over the movie, at the expense of everything else.<br /><br />The whimsy, the craziness, the unexpected twists, the fun settings (like Hogwarts and even Harry's horrible foster-family),and the humor are all gone.<br /><br />I suppose this was all deliberate, but it makes for grim watching.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	I didn't see this movie in theaters, but did rent it the week it came out.  My girlfriend and I both enjoyed the movie, both the characters and the plot were well presented.  Some of the people I've seen posting have complained about the language, but for anybody that's actually been to South Boston, they'll know what's how most of them really talk (my Dad's from Boston).  My only complain about this movie is that I think I actually liked it better when it was Infernal Affairs.  For anybody that didn't know, The Departed is an adaptation of a 2004 Asian movie.<br /><br />While The Departed stays true to the plot, characters, and story, I almost felt that they just refilmed the same movie but with bigger names.  Other than that, an excellent movie.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Enlightening and informative. This movie exposes so much with the commercial food system.  So much easier to make educated decisions for health and eating after watching this.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham is unbelievably talented.  Not only is he funny, but his ability as a ventriloquist is amazing.  He bounces from his own voice to the dummies' voices in lightning speed and does it brilliantly.  The personalities he has created for each character shine through; it's easy to forget they're not real!  This is one of the few DVD's I can watch repeatedly and still laugh like it's the first time I've seen it.  The bonus features, though long, are quite interesting.  I've been a fan of his for years and knew some background on his oldest characters, but there was still a lot of information that was new, interesting and enjoyable to hear.  Overall, listening to Jeff discuss ""behind the scenes"" is entertaining.  This is a DVD that every fan of comedy must have.  You will absolutely NOT be disappointed!!"
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"Yes, it's a very bold statement to never want to see a Lucas or Spielberg film again. But all of the negative commentary you've heard about the movie was true. Miracle refrigerators that save Indy from nuclear testing, Lebeauf swinging in the trees with the monkeys, crystal skulls that look like they were purchased from a local costume shop, and of course... ALIENS. And let's not forget that all the ""special"" effects look like nothing more than CGI on a soundstage. At the very least, the first three are classic, epic films. If you love the first three, please don't see this film."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	If you want to learn about the U.S. history in eight hours, then this is it... well done!
B001684L0A	4.0	b	This is a well-done and believable series originally aired on HBO that attempts to make these historical figures life-like and the events surrounding them more understandable. The action moves a bit fast at times, and I was actually disappointed more time wasn't spent on the Revolution itself. But it is obviously aimed at personalizing Adams and his wife more than relating the specific events of the American Revolution.<br /><br />My only criticism might be that some characters are depicted in ways that I personally doubt. I'm relatively sure the producers researched them and tried to be accurate in their portrayals, but I'm not convinced in all cases.<br /><br />The additional background portion of the DVD set is apparently vital to the understanding of the series, and I haven't yet viewed that. Perhaps that's why I'm uncomfortable with some of the characterizations. But overall, it's a well-made series, and students in public schools would be far better off watching this kind of thing than Michael Moore and Al Gore trash.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I long awaited this movie's release, but took awhile to open it.  When I finally unwrapped and played it, I found that the Blu-Ray disc skipped upon playback.  I missed the entire Godric's Hollow scene.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	When Sin City was originally released on DVD, I was quite critical of it. It was the first movie for me where a mix of Black and White and color were used in a movie in this manner. Due to the low quality of DVD picture, this caused a great dislike. The images were hard to see, and the dark parts were almost black screens.<br /><br />NOW: Enter Bluray! With Sin City being transferred over to the best quality format that it can, the movie has been revived. It can no longer be counted as a cult classic for Sin City is now a movie that you can use to show off every aspect of your home theater in beauty. The video is top-notch. VERY clear and no residual. I haven't tested the movie in my main setup but on my standard LCD it was beautiful.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I didn't know what to expect initially, but I loved it!! It was a pleasant to change to the original Snow White story albeit darker. Charlize Theron did an excellent job!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"Pixar has proven its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.<br /><br />But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by harkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.<br /><br />The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win ""The Piston Cup."" But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on ""the highway."" Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.<br /><br />Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.<br /><br />That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout."
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"I must say I was expecting more than I got during the movie. You will be fooled completely during this movie. Not because of the plot of the story, but what because the story is really about. The twist was not too original, and the ending is sort of given away near the middle, but it makes a lot of sense, and some people really do live this way. I'm not giving it away for anyone who's seen it but if you haven't yet, stop reading now.<br /><br />The Village takes place in the seemingly normal township of Covington in the year of 1897. It's a seemingly normal place with a population of merely 60 people. As the simple life of these innocent persons continues, through the cracks of this perfect and blessed comes something no one ever expected to be there in the first place.<br /><br />Strange, and evil creatures who infestate the woods around Covington have kept a truce with the townspeople for many years. The residents of Covington won't go into the woods, and the creatures won't go into the valley. But when Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) determined to show the village there is nothing to fear of these creatures, breaches the border of the woods. Now the race against time is on to stop to escape the village before all hell brakes loose.<br /><br />This is exactly what M. Night Shyamalan sets you up for and it turns from a horror/thriller, to a romance filled with physical and mental obstacles. I'm sorry to say that even though I enjoyed the film deeply, it was not what we were put up to believe it was about. I came out of the theatre thinking to myself, ""My God, what was I thinking, I want my five months back"" but then I came to realize it does have it's moments, and in it's own way is very entertaining when you look at it one way instead of the other.<br /><br />The acting, I must say, was not all it should've been. Even with nation wide actors such as William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brenden Gleeson, and Joaquin Phoenix, the village brings in people who are too used to be being in the modern times, and don't make it too believable that they are in fact in 1897. Joaquin Phoenix who is used to acting in action related movies completely flops over in this dramatic style for Shyamalan, and same goes for Sigourney Weaver. It seems like a good movie, but there's just something that makes it fall short of being so.<br /><br />There are, in fact, two things that saved this movie entirely. One, first timer Bryce Dallas Howard who is in fact the daughter of Ron Howard. As a first time roll, she's the only one that made you think otherwise about the movie. Her roll itself was played so genuinly and so perfect that it keeps you within the movie and not about what's going to happen, or about the average acting. Adrien Brody was also very good but not nearly as good as Bryce. After all, how much more better can you get than this on a first time roll?<br /><br />The second thing that really saved the Village was the amazing music. With renowned violinist Hilary Hahn, the music captures the movie more than any other I've heard. I think the soundtracks may be getting better to movies as they go along. M. Night Shyamalan did a good choice for going through with James Newton Howard to score because the violins with the fast motioness feeling to the fast parts bring in a more subtle feeling. Yet, for the suspenseful part, it brings in a low uneasy feeling to the movie. There is a certain scene many can relate when the creatures are attacking, and Lucius grabs Ivy's hand and the two rush into the basement. This is my all time favorite moment when Hilary Hahn plays the violin at its best, and it gets gorgeous. Even though it's supposed to be an intense moment, you can't help but be humbled by the beautiful music.<br /><br />The special features on the DVD aren't limited, and come with some pretty unsuspecting things that really catch your attention, and sometimes take your surprise and make you laugh. And the movie itself did in fact have some laughs, and for you might expect from review, it is good at times and brings in something unexpecting and surprising to it, and if it weren't for those creatures I waited five months to see, I would've never have gotten it.<br /><br />The only thing that would've made this movie a five star everything is that if Shyamalan wouldn't be such a one trick pony. His movies are awesome, and they build you up to expectations that were usually met with Signs and The Sixth Sense, but not with the Village. I think he wanted to go into a little more slower pace than his last movies, but when you have something that's amazing, don't change it into something else. The audience always feels they're in need of finding what they've waited for, not finding something completely different. I've found the trailer terrifying, and that's pretty much it. All in all, it's a good movie, and passed all through the flaws, it's worth 4 stars for originality. I hope Bryce Dallas Howard comes back in more movies. She was the only one that made the movie worth while. I'll keep watching M. Night Shyamalan, I just hope he can come up with more like Signs."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Everybody who is looking at this product page already knows the basic plot of ""No Country for Old Men,"" so I will not waste time recounting it here. So many of the reviews take the Coen Brothers to task for not resolving the plot at the end. I beg to differ; there IS a resolution to the plot of ""No Country for Old Men."" The resolution is simply so bleak and dour--cutting us off totally from the traditional pleasures of crime dramas, Westerns and even film noir--that viewers just don't want to believe it. I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's original novel, but everything I've read about the film leads me to believe it is extremely faithful to the source. McCarthy, for those unfamiliar with his work, is a novelist whose views of life and fate make Thomas Hardy look like A.A. Milne. It isn't surprising, then, that the makers of ""Blood Simple"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" would find McCarthy's work so congenial, and be able to do justice to his unsparing vision while other filmmakers (Billy Bob Thornton's version of ""All the Pretty Horses"" comes to mind) flinch from it. ""No Country for Old Men"" is the Coen Brothers' best film since ""Fargo"" (though even ""Fargo"" is a Disneyfied cheerfest compared with ""No Country for Old Men""; if Cormac McCarthy had written ""Fargo,"" Marge Gunderson and her unborn child would have been residual casualties, and Gunsrud would still be wandering the prairies looking for a ""pancakes house""). ""No Country for Old Men"" is a movie I greatly admire and respect, though--unlike ""Fargo""--it's not a movie I envision watching over and over again. But the Coen Brothers certainly blast the film's memory into your brain, as surely as Anton Chigurh's cattle gun. The film's screenplay (by the Coens, of course) and cinematography (vast echoing expanses of desert and mountain, captured brilliantly by the great Roger Deakins) are perfect in every way. So are the lead performances by Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin, each earning a one-way ticket to Brandoville, the capital of Olivier Land. The supporting performances of Woody Harrelson, Kelly Jean Macdonald, Barry Corbin, Tess Harper, Beth Grant, Gene Jones, Stephen Root and others are of equal (that is to say, surpassing) excellence. ""No Country for Old Men"" is unquestionably a great movie. I must confess, however, that after seeing it I had to watch ""I Remember Mama"" as an antidote."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff is the best I know whith characters. This show is very funny and very entertaining. Keeps it pretty clean through out and the feature of choosing bleeped or unbleeped versions is a great asset. A+
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This movie gives a comprehensive understanding of the BIG AGRI BUSINESS machine and how it ruins our human qualities and the sacredness of life. Food, health, honesty, animals and people manipulated for the sake of money. It is cruelty to animals and ultimately cruelty to humanity. Hope is there though in the farmers and people who refuse to operate under this AGRI DICTATORSHIP. You must see this and share it with everyone. LB, Richmond Hill, ON
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Another home run by Jeff Dunham. Definite must for fans of comedy. There is even a cool featurette on this DVD that gives a little glimpse of what goes into making his puppets as he shows the making of Melvin The Superhero.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"Don't hesitate to buy this one; you'll like it almost as much as Chuck ""I'm a private pilot myself"" Spratt loves a sheep on a saturday night...<br /><br />...hATCh - ""You can trust me, I'm an air traffic controller""..."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I feel sorry for so many of these so called agnostics who have scientically ruled out the possibility of Intelligence behind an Intelligent Creation.  How unscientific to rule out what you can't disprove.  But that is the current state of things, especially for people holding on to a sinking theory with too many holes in it(Darwin's Evolution).  But they will still hold on to it with a religious ferver because this is not theory,this is dogma.  These peoples' worldviews determine their science.  I am not a religous person but it makes me laugh when people call religion violent when the twentieth century was the bloodiest to date and why, because of Hitler, Communism and Capitalism....all bloody Godless enterprises.  Actually, when you think about, this last century was the first one where Darwinism was actually able to be implemented and taken a step further, and look what happened.  This was a great DVD, and to all those so offended by it, I understand, since I know that if this theory breaks down for you, everything else you believe in will crumble along with it.
B001OHS8BQ	3.0	b	If you want a good clean form of entertainment with no cursing, nudity, or violence then this qualifies. I appreciate this film for those reasons and will keep it in my collection.<br /><br />However, the acting is terrible. I know this was a low budget film but couldn't they have hired people who can act? I can deal with the soundtrack, the sets, and the quality of the filming...BUT please hire people who can act!<br /><br />I know people are upset with negative reviews but please let's be real. I didn't see this movie thinking it was going to have some life altering message. I just wanted to be entertained without being offended. On the basis of just being entertained this movie needed some work. I wasn't offended...well maybe I was offended by the acting... look the movie needs some improvements. So, stop thinking that anyone who gives it a bad review must be a pagan. People just know bad acting when they see it.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	"How much do you know about John Adams? I mean really know? If you're Pulitzer Prize winning author David McCullough, you know enough to share this enigmatic former President with the world.<br /><br />Not much of a congenial man, nor known to hold his tongue in tight situations, Adams has often been brushed aside by historians in favor of the more famous George Washington (played here by David Morse, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFL2G6"">16 Blocks</a>) and Declaration of Independence creator Thomas Jefferson (played by Stephen Dillane, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNFC76"">The Greatest Game Ever Played</a>). Even Ben Franklin (Tom Wilkinson, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00121QGPY"">Michael Clayton</a>) has more political notoriety than poor Mr. Adams. But Adams is so incredibly important to our nation that he deserves much more notice, and thanks to Mr. McCullough's astounding novel, there's been a resurgence in interest to the former President, thus this new miniseries by HBO.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLTR8Q"">Lady in the Water</a>) stars as John Adams, the first Vice-President (Did you remember that?) and the second President of these United States (Did you remember that, too?). His trail to fame and Presidential glory is paved with danger, disease, love, and loss.<br /><br />Giamatti's performance is especially notable in that he pulls off a ""man of the times"" role in effortless fashion. It didn't hurt, either, that the costumes were exquisitely done, the sets dirty, muddy and generally what one would expect to see around the mid-late-and-post 1700s. Adams lived to a ripe old age, too, of 91 (a good run in any era). During his lifetime he will be witness to the Boston Massacre, the Revolution against Great Britain, become the first minister to Britain after the U.S. gained its independence, and serve as Vice-President and President. A life not ordinary. Especially when you consider the nature of the man: broodish, quick to anger, stubborn in decision-making. But his temper was ...tempered by a friendship that would last a lifetime. And I'm not talking about his well-known association with Thomas Jefferson. I'm talking about the person whom he called ""My dearest friend."" Of course, this was Abigail Adams (played with exceptional poise by Laura Linney, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CS464G"">The Squid and the Whale</a>), his dedicated wife and stalwart confidant. The two were opposite sides of the same coin and proved to be a formidable pairing. When John was angry, Abigail calmed him. When he was writing, Abigail was his editor. When he was away from home (often), she took care of the children, the farm ...everything.<br /><br />Although this miniseries didn't incorporate all that John Adams was (how could it?), it did perform the prerequisite of showing us a glimpse of a man and how he battled the developing politics of his new country while trying to be the patriarchal leader of his extended family. Being a beer drinking man myself, I couldn't help but pay closer attention whenever Samuel Adams (John Adams' cousin) was mentioned or showed up on screen (played by Danny Huston, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00111YM5Q"">30 Days of Night</a>). Although just a side-note by comparison to the rest of the film, it is topical to mention that John Adams' son, John QUINCY Adams (Ebon Moss-Bachrach, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEE4"">The Lake House</a>), was the first son of a former President to become President himself (but I think he did a tad better at it than our current `son-of-a-former-President'). These touched-on items added more historical depth to the story and made the viewing audience equally enamored with John Adams even if the man himself was the complete opposite.<br /><br />This seven part miniseries is exceptional with costumes and sets that play the part just as well as the actors themselves. And if you've forgotten about John Adams' past, well, this is a nice refresher."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	very funny. would like to find more cd's with jeff and peanuts & the worm in the bottle.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	I enjoyed the video.  I like the comedian and think he is a talented ventriloquist.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"Now here is a ""comic"" book movie. They didn't mess too much with the costume, it didn't take itself waaaay too serious and it stayed fairly faithful to the source material. Plus we got that real cool set up for the Avengers. When I saw the movie in the theatre all the fanboys went nuts for that little bit at the end of the credits, and I was impressed too. I wish I had thought of it. Downey Jr. is great as Stark (unlike Christian Bale with that silly diguised voice.) It shows that you can stay pretty faithful to the source material and still make a good film. It pleased the fans AND the general audience, AND it really was Iron man. Not a guy in an armored batsuit who usually has the intellect of Sherlock Holmes but (in this movie version) gets others to do his thinking for him. Oh right.... that was another summer film. Iron man was the film of the summer as far as I am concerned."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	True Blood is probably the best series on TV period! Now I have it on DVD to watch whenever I want. :) You should own this too :)
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"hey crunkie, i'll just mention at the start here that i'm 25 and as you can see by my stars, i most definately don't agree with you. why don't you not even bother with films containing intellect in the future, since ""Village"" was a bit much to wrap your adolescent, solely liking the carnage blood n gore movie, mind around. yes, i've seen your other reviews. i mean, sure ""Village"" could have been better (films usually can if more forethought is put on them) but this was not the stupid, idiotic film you and your 'pants-saggin' cohorts seem to think. you have no patience. young people like you (Not every young person) apparently do not have that particular trait in spades, nor do they have appreciation for finer things. you very likely have no appreciation for classic literature either. you might could do with a teensy bit of respect for other's liking this film, since they're opinions are based on facts and not blatant disrespect like your comments owing to the thinking that you just don't understand things higher than freddy krueger. you come off as a hotheaded rapper guy who has little respect for things he doesn't himself find value in. you probably didn't give ""powder"" and ""k-pax"" a chance either and just dismissed them as stupid cause you didn't 'get' them, in your ""grand theft auto"" video-game warped thinking. what grade in school are you anyway? you certainly are a product of your desensitization."

B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Wow, what a ride! Iron Man is a blast from beginning to end. I'll give a brief plot description for anyone who is not familiar with the comic book:<br /><br />WARNING: SPOILERS<br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.)  is an American arms dealer who is fabulously wealthy and lives the high life. Girls, booze, parties, he does it all. Standing by his side and cleaning up his various messes is his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Whispering dark thoughts in his ear is his partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who you know from the beginning is just not okay.<br /><br />Tony goes to Afghanistan to demonstrate Stark Industries' new weapon, the Jericho missile. His convoy is attacked, his American soldier escorts are killed, and he is seriously wounded by shrapnel from one of his very own bombs. He passes out and wakes up as a captive in a Taliban-like camp. His captors want him to make them a Jericho missile, and he is horrified to see that they have a huge stockpile of Stark weapons. How did they acquire them?<br /><br />With the help of surgeon & fellow captive Dr. Yinsen, Stark makes his first Iron Man suit instead of making the Jericho missile. Using the suit he escapes and creates a big scene that attracts the attention of the U.S. military. He is rescued by the Air Force and returns home. During Stark's escape, the first Iron Man suit is all but destroyed.<br /><br />Back in the States, Stark builds a sharp new Iron Man suit, and goes back to Afghanistan to rescue Dr. Yinsen's village from the terrorist group that had captured him. The military can't figure out what Stark is, so two F-22 Raptors are called to intercept him. He inadvertently damages one of the planes but saves the pilot. Stark then confesses to his Air Force buddy LC James Rhodes (Terence Howard) that he was the cause of the accident. In addition to playing with his new toy and messing with the military, Stark is also determined to find out why the ""bad guys"" have so many of his company's weapons.<br /><br />He unravels the mystery with the help of Pepper Potts and decides he needs to change the mission of Stark Industries. His partner, Obadiah Stane is not pleased and comes up with a suit of his own; he becomes ""Iron Monger."" You can guess what happens, but suffice it to say the final battle scene between them is everything it should be.<br /><br />My husband dragged me to see this movie, and I ended up absolutely loving it. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as always; he is one of those actors that your eye is naturally drawn to while he's on screen. The rest of the cast is very good in support of him. The score is fantastic too (I have already downloaded both ""Merchant of Death"" and ""Driving With the Top Down"" into my iPod).<br /><br />Remember: Tony Stark is a grown-up superhero and this is a grown-up action movie. A good bit of it  takes place in a war zone, and there is plenty of violence and some torture. Of course it is necessary to the plot, but you should be aware that this may not be the best movie for small children.<br /><br />Bottom line: Iron Man is a blast of a movie that manages to touch on some real issues we are facing today, but never becomes preachy about it. LOTS of fun, a rollercoaster ride, a rocking action movie with a sense of humor. Loved it, and can't wait til the DVD is released!!"
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I just loved the 2 cd's that I purchased from Amazon.  They came in a timely fashion and I have watched them repeatedly.  Jeff is SOOOO talented and I did not realize that he did more than Walter & Ach-med.<br />Very funny guy!!
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	Seeing all the good reviews for this show proves the point that sex sells. After all, that's all this show is really about. There isn't really a plot and the characters are too over the top to form any real connection with. What a great way to ruin a really interesting premise: vampires out in the open! All that's left to say is.........could have..........should have...................
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"IRON MAN is a total blast.  My husband and I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time.  Based on the Marvel comic book and created by the brilliant Stan Lee, IRON MAN is a super-hero, a science fiction, an action-action adventure, and a heartwarming, feel-good movie, all rolled into one.<br /><br />In IRON MAN, Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a playboy genius, a cross between DaVinci, Tesla, and Don Juan.  As the CEO of Stark Industries, he has single handedly revolutionized the defense industry in his attempt to bring security and peace to the world.  When he is kidnapped by terrorists, Tony Stark realizes that the technology he has been steadily inventing since he was a child is falling into the wrong hands, bringing devastation and death to those he is trying to protect.  In captivity, Stark builds the prototype IRON MAN suit, and escapes.  Back at home, Stark has a crisis of conscience and decides to stand down Stark Industries weapons divisions.  Building the ultimate mech suit, Stark becomes IRON MAN, and single handedly sets out to end terrorism and save the world.  Of course, nothing is ever easy...<br /><br />All of the performances in IRON MAN are excellent and very enjoyable.  Robert Downey, Jr.'s transition from philandering whiz kid to caring, sincere patriot who wants to do the right thing is outstanding and real.  The rest of this fantastic cast (Gwyneth Paltrow, Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges, Shaun Toub) are equally good, creating believable, genuine characters, both good and evil.  The special effects rock, and are seamless and very fun.  The computer that runs Stark's home and inhabits the IRON MAN suit is very funny, exhibiting an acerbic wit that must have been very fun to write.<br /><br />There are some pretty big clues that are more IRON MAN movies to come.  I sure hope so.  I can't wait to see IRON MAN continue his fight for ""truth, justice, and the American way."""
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	This movie got off to a pretty good start.  The filmography was good, and the characters started off with good potential.<br /><br />About half way through the movie, the acting took a sharp decline, and the plot went sideways.  The ending left you inching to the edge of your seat but rather than hoping for more, you fell off.  It was almost a cliff hanger, but ended up being a real let down instead.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Good Visual effects. Charlize Theron was great! Not a fan of Kristen Stewart, but she was good too. Overall it was a good movie, and a bit different adaptation of the story. Worth watching!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I went to the movies to watch this. I love this movie so I had to make it a part of my collection. The seller sent the movie quickly and it was still wrapped up. I love it. I would buy from this seller again.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	My biggest problem with the potter series when it goes to film is that they have to leave out so much of the story.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I absolutely love Downey Jr. as an actor and this movie as well. My favorite super hero blockbuster to date. I love the fresh feeling #1 brought to the super hero film family so far. I can't wait until the 3rd!!
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	Great casting and actors, but personally I expected too much out of it because of Oscar award, I would not watch it over and over like Godfather masterpiece...
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	When I purchased this DVD I had (due to the excellence of the previous movies) extremely high expectations.  This latest installment in the Harry Potter movie series not only lived up to my expectations, it exceeded them by a movie mile.  As always, this movie perfectly blended both action and dialog to captivate and entertain me throughout.<br /><br />Harry Potter movies are always fantastic, but Deathly Hallows Part 1 is even better.  It IS a bit sad that there is only one more movie in the works, but hey.  Something to look forward to next year, right?  POTTER POWER FOREVER!
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"Ridley Scott, while making many other films during his almost 40-year career, is still most beloved for his work within the Sci-Fi genre with the original ALIEN and the neo-futuristic noir BLADE RUNNER. While I don't share most fans' love for ALIEN (I think it's a triumpth of design and style over substance), I do go gaga over the fascinatingly dark and deeply intelligent BLADE RUNNER. So I'm relatively sure that it will anger some people out there that in my opinion, Ridley Scott's return to the Sci-Fi genre after a 30-year absence in PROMETHEUS is a thematically superior film to ALIEN, but will never be a classic such as ALIEN was destined to become.<br /><br />I will never fault a film or its creators for thinking big, and that's definitely what's going on here. Written by master mindbender Damon Lindelof (the love him/hate him co-creator of LOST) and Jon Spaihts (writer of the high-concept flop THE DARKEST HOUR), we start with a bizarre, mood-setting prologue presumably millions of years ago, and then jump to the year 2089 where we have Doctors Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace of the original Swedish MILLENNIUM trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green, who looks like a stringier Tom Hardy and that character name HAS to be a easter-egg reference to LOST) discovering on Earth a pictographic pattern amongst great civilzations of the past separated by centuries and great distance. They believe it to be a star map and present this to the old, dying trillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce in convincing old-man makeup) and thus begins the adventure of discovering the origins of Earth's species in a two-year space flight in the massive ship dubbed ""Prometheus"" named for the Greek mythological figure who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. Upon arrival at their destination they pulled from this star map which is a moon for the planet LV-223, all of the crew members are awoken from their cryogenic sleep by David (Michael Fassbender), the resident synthetic (or ""artifical person"", if you will). The crew, led by company woman Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and the ship's captain Janek (Idris Elba), set down on a moon in this far-flung galaxy. Once there, they start exploring a pyramid-like structure and, in true sci-fi horror fashion, the greatest discovery in scientific history may very well mark the end of our history.<br /><br />The film has a number of problems once things really get underway. My first problems are matters of pet peeves rather than distinct criticisms: I do NOT like it when futuristic films put a specific year on them; just say ""The Future"", or put it so far in the future that this technology may seem charming and antiquated. Also, as in the STAR WARS prequels, it's not a terribly good idea to have technology be more advanced than what we see in the stories that are supposed to come AFTER this. Now comes my real criticisms: Certain members of the crew are such obvious ""red shirts"" that you know they will meet their fate before too long, however that works both ways as a major character meets their fate somewhat early on in the film which does up the ante for all of the crew. Some of the dialogue is clunky, and some character motivations are murky or just plain indecipherable. Noomi Rapace as Dr. Shaw is obviously meant to fit into the Ellen Ripley mold, which is especially apparent during the film's most visceral and suspenseful scene which involves a horrifying self-surgery, but she somehow doesn't quite fit. She's alternately too demure and then too aggressive. There is also a significant reveal that comes near the beginning of the third act that should have more impact than it does, but it just feels inorganic. Also the character of Vickers as being the ""company woman"" for Weyland Industries is designed for you to hate almost immediately; she's far too cold and self-serving. She plays the role very well, but when her character is given a spin that could make her more sympathetic, it doesn't go that way. Even Carter Burke had moments of genuine likability. The character of Janek, as played by Elba, is less of a character and more of a cliche, and it's a sad waste of such a talented actor (He's Stringer Bell, for god's sakes!). And Scott doesn't really have too many edge-of-your-seat moments that a film like this would need particularly in the film's climactic 'battle' which is more of a footnote rather than epic confrontation. Another big problem is that this has essentially already been designed as a franchise rather than a self-contained story. That may be a studio decision (knowing Fox, it probably was), but it still hurts the film more than helps it. And there is a death of another major character in this film that is done so ridiculously that it actually made me kind of angry.<br /><br />However, when the film does work, it REALLY works well. The scenes of initial discovery are incredibly absorbing and the production design work by Arthur Max (designer of every Ridley Scott film since G.I. JANE as well as David Fincher's SE7EN) is stunning to behold. The cinematography of Dariusz Wolski (DP of all of the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN films, but my favorite work of his is Alex Proyas' underrated masterpiece DARK CITY) is crisp and moody, and the team at Weta Digital who did the effects work did some eye-popping work as well. The philosophical/theological themes and ideas are handled in an intelligent and thought-provoking fashion, and when the suspense is really unleashed, it's far more effective than the large-scale set pieces. The show is essentially stolen right out from everyone else by the brilliant work by Fassbender (who I believe to be one of the hardest working men in the business right now), who is charming and eerie in his childlike fascination, and seems so eager to please, despite his true motives. His moments, even when he's done something truly terrible, are still done with such a benevolence that you know that everything terrible he's doing is not his responsibility, and he does play to a certain regret as he seems to grow throughout the film. Marc Streitenfeld's (also all of Scott's films since AMERICAN GANGSTER) score is somewhat restrained, and that's unusual in a film like this, until the suspense racks up and we're flooded in sound and fury.<br /><br />While this doesn't directly link to the ALIEN franchise, it obviously went out of its way to make sure it was in the same universe, with the whole expedition being financed and overseen by Weyland Industries (which would later become Weyland-Yutani, the company that sent out The Nostromo), and finding these strange and aggressive species on LV-223. As I stated before, this film doesn't present a self-contained story lending itself very obviously to a sequel or entire new franchise for Fox to explore (and eventually exploit, because after all... it's Fox) and so, all the questions that are posed in this film are left relatively unexplored and whether or not we'll see more classical versions of face-huggers, chest-bursters or xenomorphs in future films is up in the air. There is something to work with there both on a thematic and visceral scale, but like the previous ALIEN franchise, it's unlikely that we'll see Ridley Scott returning.<br /><br />I certainly didn't love this film, because when it is good, it's really very good, and when it's bad, it's more innocuous rather than totally debilitating. But unless Fox decides to cede more (or less, depending upon whatever made the film less than stellar) control to the creative team of this film, I'm sure that any further adventures of the remaining crew members of PROMETHEUS might be similarly hamstrung.<br /><br />3.5/5 Stars"
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I thought this movie was very good.  It was nice to see a movie with a good story line that was minus the usual filth that Hollywood loves so much.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	How can this be?  A movie based on a comic book character that not only doesn't suck, it actually improves on the original story of the origins of the character!  Unlike most super hero movies, Iron Man is mostly an unknown and therefore easier to work with without totally ruining it for anyone who read and followed the old comics.  That said, this is just a great movie with a smart story and excellent casting.  Absolutely great to own and can't wait for the sequel.
B001684L0A	1.0	b	When we went to view the DVD, we found two disc 2's and no disc3.  Amazon fixed the problem, but what a pain.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	This film has some interesting ideas of the nature of Fear as tool to control using an isolationist Amish style community as its setting.However it was spoilt; by yet another cameo appearance by the Director and his rather formularized 'surprises' which now are his trademark.It would work if your Hitchcock,but he aint !!!!.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	There has been at least one review that highlighted some of the sexual scenes in the film. To respond to that reviewer, the film was rated PG-13, not G or even PG. Furthermore, don't get me started on why foul language/moderately graphic violence or other behaviors are allowed and tolerated in most big budget Hollywood films that ARE aimed at children! After all, this is a review of Iron Man. Most people who didn't 'get' Robert Downey's portrayal of Stark didn't ever read the original comics, or if they did, forgot much of what they read.<br /><br />Let's not forget that Tony Stark was the original rich, womanizing, misogynistic playboy who had an epiphany steering him onto a new course in life. I didn't all of a sudden go from a hard drinking, cigar smoking playboy to a Priest, but he DID change his ways. This was portrayed by Downey almost flawlessly.  To categorize this as a flawless performance would be difficult because movies about superhero characters lend themselves to so much broad interpretation from long time comic fans, to casual readers, to those who dismiss comics as 'kid stuff'.<br /><br />At it's heart, IM was a great movie that happened to be about a superhero. I'm glad that the movie wasn't action top to bottom. This made the action sequences more enjoyable, and highlighted the acting prowess of the great cast (how'd they get Gwyeneth Paltrow to sign on at Potts?!) I for one look forward to IM 2, but I'm less anticipatory of the Avengers...I mean look at the X-Men franchise!
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	"It really could have been a great movie, unfortunately Kristen Stewart ruins the movie. I felt like I was watching her ""act"" rather than believing she was Snow White."
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	TrueBlood Season 1 was a great ride.  It stuck close to the Southern Vampire Mystery Series by Charlaine Harris, with a little bit of Hollywood stuck in there.  The settings were great; the homes seemed very realistic as well as the people.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I recommend all people to view this DVD.<br />We all have an idea that the western/American diet or way of eating might not be so great for us; but watching this helps bring those ideas more clearly into focus.
B000H7I6CU	3.0	b	"""Cars"" is director John Lasseter's tribute to American automobile culture. It rolls his love of NASCAR and fondness for the family road trip into a children's morality tale with a little history lesson. The world of ""Cars"" is a populated by driverless autos, so the characters are all machines. A hotshot, rookie racing car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) who thinks of nothing but winning the Piston Cup has one week to get to his race in California. But a mishap en route lands McQueen in traffic court in the southwestern town of Radiator Springs. The town judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), wants the arrogant little racer out of town ASAP, but Porsche prosecutor Sally (Bonnie  Hunt) wants McQueen to pave the town's dilapidated main thoroughfare instead, in hopes that it will bring travelers back to the Route 66 town that they abandoned when the interstate was put through. McQueen is loathe to miss his race, but the townsfolk and a hillbilly tow truck named Mater (Dan Whitney) may change his priorities.<br /><br />""Cars"" is an attractive film that smoothly integrates two aspects of car culture -racing and road trips- into a lesson about friendship and respect and a little history of Route 66 towns. But the script is pedestrian. It's hard to believe that someone thought a bunch of bickering over paving a road would be entertaining. You can tune out large sections of this movie without missing anything. ""Cars"" has a lot of technically impressive animation but really only engages visually at the racetrack. It opens with a bang as cars whiz around the track at the Piston Cup and closes in the same vein, with the tiebreaker race, which is much more involving. I can't say if children would enjoy ""Cars"", but, at 1 hour and 54 minutes, it is tedious and way too long. Since ""Finding Nemo"", Pixar has lost its flare for clever dialogue and distinctive animation that adults can enjoy too. To my mind, if a film is too dull for adults, its' not worth a child's time either. Pixar needs better writers.<br /><br />The DVD (Pixar 2006): Bonus features include 2 animated short films, 4 deleted scenes, the movie's epilogue, and a documentary about the inspiration behind the film. ""Mater and the Ghostlight"" (7 min) is a short film in which Mater gets his comeuppance for playing practical jokes. ""One Man Band' (4 1/2 min) is a short film unrelated to ""'Cars"", in which a couple of street musicians duel for the approval of a little girl. ""Epilogue"" (4 min) is the last part of ""Cars"" that played over the credits. In ""Inspiration for Cars"" (16 min), John Lasseter talks about merging the worlds of racing and road trips, the decline of Route 66, and shares part of the Route 66 road trip that the filmmakers took with ""Route 66: The Mother Road"" author Michael Wallis. Subtitles for the film are available in English only."
B002QZ1RS6	1.0	b	I purchased Insanity, ready to start a new workout challenge.  Almost a week into the workouts, I found that one of the DVDs skipped, which made it impossible to do the workout.  I ended up returning the product and purchasing one with all working DVDs.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	"In the last 30 minutes of this epic mini-series John Adam (Paul Giamatti) viewed the famous John Trumbull's picture of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, John Adams states that he did not understand why people felt that they needed to modify history. The way it happened should be good enough (I am paraphrasing here).  That is my exact sentiment with HBO's presentation of ""John Adams"". Why did they need to make non-factual changes? Most of the changes were superficial to the story, but significant in the life of Adams.<br /><br />  Many of these changes are well documented by other reviewers, however some of the changes are nonsensical. For example why did they feel he need to move up Nabby's death by 11 years?  Why did they not have Nabby and Colonel Smith meet in Europe? Why did they make it appear that John and Abigail only had John Quincy accompany them to Europe (when in fact, Charles and Nabby accompanied them). Oddly enough, HBO made this is a point of contention between Charles and John... that Charles was not allowed to join John in Europe! Why change history?<br /><br />  Ok, now I will get off of my soap-box. In truth, the min-series ""John Adams"" was expertly done and deserves the many honors it has received. The sets and acting were phenomenal (see ""Thomas Jefferson"", ""George Washington"", and best of all ""Benjamin Franklin"") and true to the period. In the first chapter I was completely enthralled by the 1770's Boston. It was beyond anything that I could have imagined.<br /><br />  While I have never been a Paul Giamatti fan - he was an excellent choice for John Adams. Giamatti was able to portray both the insecurities and physical attributes nearly flawlessly (although interestingly enough they did make mistakes with his teeth as they alternated between normal and rotten).  Giamatti clearly mastered the role and embodied everything  that we would expect from Adams.<br /><br />  A note for teachers - I was disappointed in the nudity in the first and last installment. While neither were sexual in nature in my opinion ""implied"" nudity would have been just as effective. As it stands, neither the first nor last chapter could be used in a class room. There is also a graphic scene of Mr. & Mrs. Adams when they meet for the first time in Paris. No nudity, but it probably would not be allowed by your school's principle.<br /><br />Things that I liked about the movie<br /><br />- The portrayal of John and Abigail Adams was excellent<br />- The sets and costumes....wow<br />- Special features on the disc - make a nice commentary to the movie<br />- The portrayals of George Washington, Ben Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson<br />- The length of the mini-series - my biggest compliment to HBO is that they did not skimp and cut but embraced the entire life of John Adams<br />- The price of the DVDs - honestly this is a bargain for the amount of material that you are getting!<br /><br />Areas for improvement<br /><br />- The purposeful misrepresentation of the natural occurrence in John Adams life. I am completely clueless in why HBO did not stay true to history and David McCullough's book. This cost it a star<br />- The unnecessary nudity.<br /><br />Final verdict - Was the mini-series flawed in terms of pure history... Absolutely! Is it worth watching - YES! If this wasn't based on David McCullough's masterful biography I would rate ""John Adams"" as one of top 10 movies. However, since the biography drifted into fiction I have to downgrade it a bit.<br /><br />4 stars - great for those 16 and over (although most high schoolers may be bored to tears)."
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	this is a great movie great actors great plot action from beginning toend I think everyone should watch it at least once I watched it twice in one week
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	I had high hopes for this movie but I ended up very disappointing.  I only found one character interesting was the ship's captain.<br /><br />Visually the movie is beautiful.  The characters are flat and uninteresting.  And the plot was disappointing
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This is the first Blue-ray movie I bought for my new system. I loved the movie when I saw it in the theater. It looks even better on Blu-ray. The action scenes pop off the screen. I love the story line, action and humor that combine to make this a very enjoyable evening in from of the flat screen!!! Have only watched the movie and cannnot comment on any of the extras that are included in this edition.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"Be warned:  Spoilers ahead.<br /><br />A 60+ year old man climbs into an old 1950's era fridge to seek shelter from the impact of a nuclear blast.  I know, those fridges back then were strong, no doubt.  I don't think the contents inside would have been fried, but this fridge was thrown for what seemed to be a mile before finally crashing hard to the ground.  Surely anything inside, while not completely toasted, should have been beaten and broken from all of the impact.  Right?  Well this 60+ year old man walks out relatively UNSCATHED!<br /><br />That's just a taste of bad things to come if you continue to watch this ridiculous movie.  The jeep chase through the jungle, Shia Labeouf's character swinging through the jungle his first time ever touching a vine, and (whispering voice)the big reveal about the Shia character's relationship to Indy.  Oooooh, you'll never guess...if you're a moron.<br /><br />There were many, MANY instances where I had to force myself to sit through it.  It was a struggle for me not to turn off my player.  I got throuhg it because I wanted to see if there was anyting good about it.  I now regret it.<br /><br />So now Shcumacher's 'Batman and Robin' now has a close friend on my ""Worst Movies I've Ever Seen"" list.  'Crystal Skull' is like an epic comedy...that's not funny at all."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Love the man.  Love his humor, his creativity, would absolutely adore seeing him in person some day.  Cracks me up. :)
B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	This documentary is great.  I actually saw it - unlike the majority of the 1 star reviewers.  I believe that this movie hit a nerve and has caused some really stupid people to think they can kill it by a negative Amazon.com review.  I saw it in the theater and have ordered the DVD.  This documentary uses a Michael Moore approach to expose the elite scientific community's stifling of anyone who proposes, suggests, or mentions intelligent design.  He also exposes some of the failures in Darwinism the religion of many scientists (Oxymoron or just morons?)  I give this 4 stars as I think Ben could have gone even farther and given more examples of others who have been Expelled.  Oh - well - probably for the sequel.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	A successful fantasy requires more than special effects, action, dwarves, white horses, evil villains and pretty women. I felt like the director really wanted this to be comparable to Lord of the Rings.  It's so very much not.  Without a good screenplay, the remaining elements are merely window dressing.  This story was sloppy, flat, predictable, and tedious.  The dramatic pans, sweeping landscapes and musical score couldn't prop up what simply wasn't there.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"First, I must tell you that as a child I loved the Indy series. They had action, adventure, light romance, and simply tickled the imagination. I also realize that in these times of ""special effects"", a simple story of action and adventure may not appeal to the masses. Here in lies my dilemma, I liked the series as a child (not to mention several others like Fantasy Island, Love Boat, Knight Rider, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Murder She Wrote, Remington Steele, Moonlighting, The Goonies, The Gremins, Star Wars, and other 80S, 90s TV shows and movies...I could go on and on and on, but you get my drift) and therefore knew, when compared to what sells today, this would be a hard sale. A continuation of a much loved story, with an older star and special effects to an old theme. Compared to Matrix and the recent Star Wars movies, this seemed to be not as exciting, but for those who love the traditional action adventure movies, they will be able to watch it and have no other expectations but to be entertained. While I do not think this is the best Indy ever, I wasn't as disappointed as other reviewers seem to be.<br /><br />Now the review, which will be short and sweet. Indiana Jones (Professor by day, Adventurer by night) is still an adventurer who is able to use a whip better than those half his age. Captured by those ""dastardly Nazi's"" who are searching for the remains of an alien, who crashed in New Mexico, Indy must find the crystal skull which will lead to the Kindgom of the Crystal Skull and the City of Gold. Of course during his search, he encounters more Nazi's (including Kate Blanchett who sports a mean bob), double agents, old friends, old loves, a possible son, is the victim of nuclear testing, aliens and so much more. So, with all that said, I give this latest Indy adventure a ""3"". I wouldn't purchase it, but as a rental on a Sunday, with nothing else to do, I would give it a whirl."
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	I was extremely disappointed with this film.  Mind readers and aliens belong on a Stargate sequel, not Indiana Jones, but that's exactly what happens here.  There is some good action, some decent humor, but the plot is absolute garbage.  For me, I'm going to pretend that this Indiana Jones movie never existed.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is a great ventriloquist.  The stand up comedy is great. Walter and Peanut are my favorite.  Will buy more of Jeff Dunham's comedy .
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"When the film started with a CGI gopher I thought it was an advertisement for Ice Age 3. But no, it was Indian Jones with Ice Age Cartoon gophers. And then it went on, obviously painfully half the movie is CGI but without much effort. Cate Blanchett is a wasted talent in this movie and seems to know it, her accent slipping ever so often. Harrison Ford is his same old self, literally, he is OLD and rather out of place. Lucas hasn't lost his touch - that is from Epsiode I and on, this seems to be one more ""sell more toys"" movie without any other regard, except of course use CGI at every chance. Spielberg? Was he even there or did he do it all over the phone, or did he do what limited job he had before Lucas came in to do CGI? LaPoof is actually half decent but I am lost why he is there at all. Then the plot is like it is running between highlights of former glories instead of any kind of story. Right up to half the movie I was thinking ""Well it is on par with Temple of Doom"" which IMHO isn't half good, but don't worry half way through this movie surprises you by becoming a lot worse. The net outcome is exactly the sum of its parts = 1 Star."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	A great rendition of a fantastic series by a comic writer that has created a brutally real universe.  A must see fer sure !  :)
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	great dvd, a great gift for my daughter and myself, both of us are potter fans!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This is a really good movie.  Great for the family.  My husband and I enjoyed as much as our 2 year old!!!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	For I will see Night's (thats' what fans call the director He's INDIAN, not English) new movie the Village.  He makes movies for Actors, theya re not boring.  they Stress character, people!! From what I've heard this movie is about a group of Mormons who live away from society and the Parents tellt hem scary stories from keeping them from going in the woods.  It is a scary film because of how the people ACT!  Not because of monsters.  If you want monsters go see Freddie veres Jason!!  If you want monsters then this movie is NOT FOR YOU!  so dont go tell people not to see it because you dont UNDERSTAND it!!!<br /><br />Also there is a girl in it who is playing a blind girl.  I think the actresses name is Adrianne Brody, but I am not sure. and its very hard to do, but she plls it off thats why its a good performance!
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	Even though this was the most poorly written of the seven books, the film should have been able to correct this.  Where the book dragged on endlessly in some scenes, the film instead cuts the scenes it does choose to include so short that you really are not sure what is going on.  Several scenes I'm left wondering what really happened, and I've even read the book!  To make it worse, several great scenes from the book were missing or completely altered to be something completely different.  I cannot imagine what kind of ego it takes to alter moments from immensely popular book (the reason this movie is even being made).<br /><br />In short, you have to watch it because the first four were so good, and the next two (I hope!) will be good movies, but the bottom line is this movie was poor.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	The movie starts out really visually interesting for maybe the first 20 or 30 minutes, but leaves you wondering when something is going to happen. The movie really has nothing to do with the Alien movies except that the big slow engineer aliens and the big engineer ships look the same in both movies. I knew going into this movie that Ridley Scott had stated that it's not an actual prequel, but I at least expected a decent movie. Gimmicky marketing tricks make you think this is going to be a movie in the same class as the Alien movies.<br /><br />This is a very slow scattered movie with a horrible story and a mess of a script. The plot focuses on the idea that humans came from giant space aliens who are dumb and don't try to communicate. This movie has no action, no drama, no suspense, no tension, no adventure, no background story, and no character development. There are no connections or attachment to any of the characters. The characters are unintelligent and annoying.<br /><br />Here is a list of some of the places that the movie fails on common sense:<br />[...]<br /><br />This is literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't know how the same producer of some of my all-time favorite movies including the original Alien movie can put out this complete piece of garbage movie
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"""Iron Man"" stars the irresistible Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a rich weapons designer who eventually ends up captured by terrorists in Afghanistan. Stark manages to invent a bionic suit made of iron and escape from his captors, although the experience leads to a shift in his business strategy and an ultimate showdown with his longtime business partner (Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />I knew nothing about the Iron Man character before seeing this movie, and I wasn't prepared to like this film as much as I did. It's a very character-driven movie, which sets it apart from your average run-of-the-mill action flicks. Downey is charming and absolutely perfectly cast in this role, and he has amazing chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow, who portrays Stark's assistance/platonic love interest, Pepper. ""Iron Man"" is a hilarious, exciting movie that will definitely make me buy a ticket to see the sequel when it arrives in theatres two weeks from today."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	the dobby in the picture is exactly what it looks like. The teeth are a shaped a little weird/creepy/scary (for kids). Its seems like it would have been better marketing if they made dobby as cute/loving as his character is rather than having his teeth look pointy and his stance look like hes scared, but its still cool and the person i bought it for loves it. the movie played fine.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	wasnt a huge fan of aviator, but this is on par with goodfellas.......great movie!
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Mmm so so , I think the movie needs better actors, betters especial effects , and better drama . Everything else is good, actually, I dot<br />Know what I'm talking about
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	It's a good movie overall but Kristen Stewart has the emotional capacity the size of a teaspoon. She just always looks the same and has the same facial expressions and her fake accent sort of goes in an out. The accent will be stronger at certain times and weaker in the next scene. Don't get me wrong, I do like this movie, I just think the main character was sort of lacking well, character. I would still recommend this movie to anyone who's interested though because despite K-Stew being a crappy actress it's still a good movie and provides an interesting take on the classical Snow White story. So, overall, good movie and action packed!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Who knew American history could be so exciting? This movie was excellent and I was sorry to see it end after 8 episodes. I have not read David Mccullough's book yet, but I definitely will. I hope HBO does many more historical dramas of this quality in the future!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Every marriage that isn't rock solid would benefit from seeing, FIREPROOF.  What a great movie, bringing hope back to those who feel they are losing the battle to keep their marriage alive.<br /><br />Most Christ centered people know that without God, a marriage (and a meaningful life) has little chance of surviving.  Fireproof gives the hope Christ centered Christians already know...that if one makes Jesus first in their lives, God will work everything else, out.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"I collect all the ""Pixar"" movies. This one is exceptional."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Robert Rodriguez's best movie in a outstanding Blu-ray edition. Audio and video are fantastic. Thank you Amazon for another excellent job. Congratulations!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This isn't a movie all about animals and vegetarianism, which I think a lot of people think it is about. It is about the nations food supply, the politics behind it, and what the industry doesn't want the consumer to know. I believe we should know what we are putting into our bodies, and how that food got to our plate, grocery store, etc. Once people are educated on the different companies and practices, they can vote with their dollar by buying and supporting companies they believe in. I think this movie should be mandatory for everyone to see, and played in junior high and high schools across the country. People need to take an active interest in what they are eating and realize that every action has a reaction.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	Well I'll admit I went to see this flick because of Rourke,<br /><br />yeah I'm one of those people who thought Rourke's early<br /><br />work was Deanesque.Basically the movie has 3 complete sections<br /><br />Willis was OK as Hartigan his storyline average,Clive Owen was<br /><br />good his storyline was better,but Rourke did in fact as the majority of reviewers suggest steal this movie.He was so good that as some major newspapers suggested that the Marv character<br /><br />should have been the WHOLE movie.It's great to see an overrated actor like Willis (who I like by the way) get totally blown out of the water by Mickey Rourke.I will buy this DVD for Rourke's acting alone as he was that good.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is so funny i could not stop laughing this DVD and the other one Arguing with myself are both good you have got to see them both.HE IS FUNNY
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"People always try to evaluate Shyamalan films on the inevitable and anxiously awaited ""twist"" he has become so infamous for. In a sense, he's a director that has been typecast. Now, being someone who figured out ""The Sixth Sense"" from the teaser previews, and hence already knowing what the twist was to be in what is regarded as his best and most surprising flick, I've instead focused a lot more on the message. All of his films have them, from the almost inane ""for every good, there is a corresponding evil"" in ""Unbreakable"", to the more profound message of faith in ""Signs"".<br /><br />One of this movie's twists is evident from the beginning. Elder Walker (William Hurt) is the founder and leader of a society of folks who have retreated from the violence of the modern world, and taken refuge in an agrarian paradise. However, all paths to paradise have a sacrifice, and the sacrifice in this particular one is the complete lack of modern medicine, a technology of the outside world. Having sworn never to go back, the Village Elders find themselves in a quandary when Lucius Hunt (Pheonix) is wounded in a brutal attack by Noah Percy (Brody), a savage but essentially retarded village boy, who shares Hunt's infatuation for Walker's blind but ever-so-aware daughter Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard - watch for more excellent work from this extremely talented actress). As Lucius and Ivy are regarded by the Elders as bedrock on which the future of the Village rests, particularly after the Elders pass away, a tough decision is made to send Ivy, with two male guardians (hardy Village boys), to the edge of the forest to seek the arcane and forbidden medicine to heal Lucius.<br /><br />As a backdrop for the story, the forest surrounding the Village is the inviolate territory of ""those we don't speak of"", terrible monsters who wreak horrible retribution on any who enter. At the same time, small animals are turning up mutilated in the Village. Assumed to be the work of the monsters in the woods, this violent incursion into the Village by those who have essentially besieged it creates an ominous sense of foreboding and impending doom.<br /><br />Some people went to see ""The Village"" expecting a horror film of sorts. The film is almost entirely a psychological drama, and the tension is purely psychological throughout. Perhaps its most profound point is when Ivy, on her way back with medicine, comes face to face with one of ""those we don't speak of"", supposedly impossible at this point in the film, and learns that even paradise breeds its own monsters.<br /><br />It's a good film. It's even better if you watch it with your mind open, and not expecting to have a temporary lobotomy for 2 hours as in so many other films with no message, but a lot of eye popping effects. Any film that one either loves passionately or hates vociferously has to be one you should see ;-)"
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I love Harry Potter.  This movie is great, like all the others.  My DVD arrived, very well packed, and in very good time.  I couldn't be more pleased.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I enjoyed this movie, looks great in hd, enjoyed enough to rent tho, not sure if it's my kind of movie I would purchase
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is the most fantastic ventriloquist  I ever saw in action. He and his puppets are perfect in the art of making people enjoy fantastic moments!!!<br /><br />Do not miss Walter, Peanuts, Mr Jose and all others playing with words and laughs!!!!!!!!
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	"I agree with the majority of options here regarding the undeveloped plot, so I won't rehash them too much.  I should say, to be fair, that there are some really great performances in this film, especially Imelda Staunton as Professor Umbridge, andalso Daniel Radcliffe and Ralph Fiennes.  Unfortunately, the film is cut so bare-bones that we lose many (assumedly) great performances from the likes of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and even Michael Gambon.  Character development is lost for plot advancement, which will hurt the impact of the final two films, in my opinion.<br /><br />Of course, I'm an obsessive completist (and admit to being a hypocrite feeding the machine), so I planned to purchase this film anyway (and felt justified enough because of the solid performances mentioned above).  Once I popped the film into my DVD player, though, I was shocked at how awful this transfer was: the picture is incredibly grainy (which was not intention like in some movies, like the ""Ocean's"" films).  I cannot believe that Warner Bros. would put out such a poor-quality release, especially for one of their strong franchise titles, and especially for the two-disc edition, where they're asking consumers to pay more (for something we used to get for free just a few years ago, but I digress...).<br /><br />I hope against hope that Warner Bros. announces a recall for this batch of DVDs.  It's a shame that any film--let alone one of their most successful films of the year--would get such a transfer."
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	The story line was fine, but with all of the build up of Snow White going mano-a-mano with the Wicked Queen, I thought that the ending scene was not very exciting. I thought they could have done more with Chris Hemsworth's Woodsman character in that scene.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	We had watched this from Netflix and liked it so much we bought it from Amazon. Now we're sharing it with our grown children. The series makes the history come alive and the people more real. It was wonderful.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"though this may be an unpopular view, i really disliked the last film. maybe it's my overly american sensibilities but i found it hokey to say the least and wayyyy over-acted (perhaps ""over-directed"" if i may?) to say the most. frankly, i was embarrassed to be watching it, but then it's easy to forget the movie is supposed to be for a younger crowd. that said, this movie clearly isn't for a younger crowd. considering how daunting the task of packing such a large book into such a small window of time (respectively speaking), i thought the director did a fantastic job. no one wants to see any part of the book get the chop, but some things just had to go to fit in the time--and let's face it, those kids aren't getting any younger so to make it a two part movie would have been asking too much i think. i'm totally pleased with the drama of the movie, i thought it was just right.<br />that being said, having seen it with people who haven't read any of the books and hardly remember what they saw in the last movies, despite the excellent job the director did with giving us some information but not too much information to be confusing, my friends had a tough time really putting the pieces together from all the movies to get one whole picture. i don't blaim the movie though--they should have read the books :)"
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	One of the most recent in the Marvel Comic-book to screen translations of classic superheros, this time it's Iron Man about Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.); the young, egotistical heir to Stark Industries (weapon creators and manufactuers).<br /><br />On a routine trip in the middle east Tony gets taken prisoner and is demanded to build his newest weapon, the jericho, for these criminals. With a little help Tony plots his only way of escape, an iron suit.<br /><br />When Tony finally returns home he is a changed man, destined to return to seek his revenge on the men that held him captive, and of course  get his weapons back from the wrong hands.<br /><br />Similar to Batman Begins, Iron Man is more focused on the acts of Tony becomming the Iron Man, then infact jumping completely into an action packed adventure, amazingly it's thurough enough to get the full story yet the pace never draws too slow.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Mr. Tony Stark, he carries that perfect overconfident yet always believable attitude .<br /><br />One of the best superhero movies yet.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I bought this for my dad for christmas.  When he comes home in a bad mood  he just pops in the dvd and instant laughter.
B008UBYTRG	1.0	b	This stand-up might have been funny without the audience overshadowing the comedian. A really annoying taping. It was like a sitcom with a bad laugh track. I pay to see the comedian, not hear strangers react.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	ALL Blue Ray Movies must be cheap, include a regular DVD and a free digital download, or I will not purchase it!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Kids love cars and so do adults.  Entertaining, not too long.  Buyer beware, if you have children, they will want everything Cars related after watching. vroom vroom vroom.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I received this item very quickly and our entire family laughed watching this performance. Thanks for making our holiday special.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Got this as a present for my nephew and he fell in love with it, amazing gift
B001KEGR8Y	1.0	b	Just attempted to watch some of this on Amazon Prime's streaming service. Probably the most unfunny comedian I've ever watched, with Carlos Mencia being a close second. How the hell either of these guys got popular I have to wonder. Made it through 5-10 minutes of this Dunham crap and stopped.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"I'm one of the many who absolutely loved the last film, The Half Blood Prince. IMO, it's a long book, but David Yates did what he could and gave us a fairly solid adaptation. And so it goes, we're at the end of the movie series. It's not a pleasant feeling knowing that we're at the end, but it's been a hell of a ride! And dare I say it, Hallows part one is definitely the best film since Goblet of Fire!<br /><br />Of course, there was much controversy upon the news of the finale being split in two, and I'll admit I was one of the ""TWO movies? [...] that"" crowd, but after doing some thinking, I realized it's a long book and so much important stuff happens, so after all, it's only reasonable. And I waited. And waited. And then, the showtimes for opening night got released, and I found that it was playing in the new Canadian projection system AVX, with wall to wall screen, rocker seats and crystal clear image and sound. So I went after work, a week early too, to go get my ticket, and awaited opening day.<br /><br />Needless to say, this movie did not disappoint.<br /><br />I was surprised at the amount of material that was covered. It was more of 75% of the book in a 146-Minute movie, and so I was pleased. This movie is also startlingly different from the other ones too. As expected, and shown in the books, the dark level rose with every book, and as seen in the trailers, this would be the darkest and grittiest. And my friends, it is just that, and thankfully so too. This basically strips away the glossiness of the others and gives us a rough, gritty, raw, disturbing and depressing feel/visual palette.<br /><br />Also, I normally detest shaky camera, as it looks ridiculous, gives me a headache and looks like someone with Parkinson's shot it. But here, it was used in the best way possible!!!! It actually added to the raw feel of the film, and suited the movie's dark tones well too. I was actually floored at how well done the shaky camera was, and furthermore, just how well done the film was.<br /><br />In short, I walked out tickled pink and happy, because this is the Harry Potter I asked for, and I got. I am absolutely stoked for part two. Bravo, David Yates! Bravo!!!"
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	"Oh, what a disappointment. David Yates had it all, a stellar cast, plenty of  base material from JK Rowling's second longest book, and special effects at his disposal and what did he and Michael Goldenberg (screenwriter taking the place of HP veteran Steve Kloves) do? They trimmed away everything interesting whatsoever about the book and left the remaining awkward shards jumbled together. For God's sake, you've got Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis and Emma Thompson sitting around doing nothing. I kept shouting at the screen ""Use them! Use them!"" How is it that one of the longest novels is turned into the shortest movie? Now, I wasn't a big fan of the 3rd or 5th books in the HP series but I was hoping that Yates, like Cuaron, would go past the source material and make the film into a triumphant masterpiece. He didn't. The payoff of the film would have to be Imelda Staunton's dead-on portrayl of the most evil Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher yet, Occlumency Lessons with Snape, of course, the trip to the Ministry of Magic and Voldemort's duel with Dumbledore. But, we all knew that those would be great. It would have been nice if the film didn't act that all it needed was a whiff-bang end and the audience would forget the shlocky job up until then. The dementors here have NONE of the atmosphere that Cuaron's did, no screaming in Harry's ears, etc, what about the Quibbler Interview, Ron's Quidditch debut, Ron and Hermione becoming prefects, the disappointment is crushing. I don't know whose fault it is, David Yates or Michael Goldenberg. I only hope that the David Yates crew (thankfully this time with Steve Kloves) will not screw up the 6th movie. It is the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the Harry Potter series and if they screw it up, I'll go nuts. For the love of God, please let Alfonso Cuaron who has mentioned he wouldn't mind directing another HP movie direct the 7th movie. Unless Yates proves himself on the 6th film, I don't want him touching the 7th with a 9 yard wand."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Whassup Amazon.... i bought this movie from Wal-Mart for about $26.00 and I always get $10 off to purchase any blu-ray disc I bought, so which means I actually be getting new blu-ray movies for $15 instead.  I owned four blu-ray movies so far.  Hey, I want to say this movie, The Departed is very entertaining and fun to watch. but not about comedy because it just an New American Crime Classic style...  whatever we call it Gangsta/Crime type of movie, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg makes me laugh alot.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon keep me guessing a lot. I'm pretty glad that Alec Baldwin is in this movie, and he is doing his best and I remembered him from Beetlejuice when he was skinny and look younger... but this movie everyone looks different and does the best job in this movie. I thought Anthony Anderson might kill this movie alittle bit but I dont see any flaw, so I'm glad he is doing great so the movie is flawless victory!! Excellent acting, and picture quality... of course the 5.1 Audio sound from Dobly Digital but I am confused with (PCM 5.1) but anyway buy this movie because it is an recommended for blu-ray.  Holla!!
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	I enjoyed this movie. Not great, not bad; better than many, but worthy of no Oscars.  But I will say this:  I've seen plenty of movies in my time, and I've seen actors and actresses be angry on screen, very angry.  Yet this is the first time ever that I ever really believed a character was angry.  When Cameron becomes angry at his wife early in the movie and starts yelling at her, I cringed because I really sensed that this was not acting, but that he really was ballistic at her, like a line had been crossed from acting to real anger.<br /><br />I've never sensed this before, but Cameron let me sense real anger, anger that I myself have felt.  It blew me away in a sort of scary way.<br /><br />Was he acting?  Sure, but I couldn't tell at all; that's what was amazing.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This should be a requirement to view before any marriage! Seriously, this is a fantastic movie for any married couple or those considering marriage.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I was taken aback by how interesting and excellent this film was. I saw several reviews over the course of the last year that claimed No Country for Old Men was a disappointment. I found it to be anything but that. Honestly, at just over 2 hours long, I wished its length was double. Its ending may not be what viewers desire but it was appropriate given the nature of the characters. I found The Ladykillers very poor so I see this movie as definitely being a return to form for the Coen brothers who, next to Martin Scorsese, are the best directors of our era (in my opinion). Yes, Josh Brolin was excellent, yes, Tommy Lee Jones was excellent, but this fellow Javier Bardem was absolutely superb. I had never heard of him previously, but he played the perfect villain--a mixture of subtlety and aggression. The guy is scarier than DeNiro was in Cape Fear. He made the film for me, but then again, the Cormac McCarthy plot would have won me over anyway.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"This movie is beautiful.  It is sad.  It is intense.  It is startling.  It is scary.  It is horrifying.  It is quiet.  It is powerful.<br /><br />It is all these things, and yet the true power of the movie is in the one thing which it so clearly portrays without articulation.<br /><br />What you may not pick up from reviews is the way it ties several key themes together to formulate an emotionally pregnant question about societal direction.<br /><br />First, most of the important characters are Vietnam vets.  In its emotionally communicative (but wordless) way, the movie draws a significant sympathy out of the viewer for these men who have seen and been through so much.<br /><br />The second theme is that of these same characters getting older.  They are struggling with what do do in their advancing years; retire, find a ""Vietnam-like"" line of work, hunt, etc.  There are several scenes where you see their sense of connection between each other on the basis of these two connections that all the vets have.<br /><br />The third theme is the growing violence and senslessness of society.  Violent murders, drug wars, deviant practices, and stories in the news all contribute to the picture we see of a rapidly degenerating society.<br /><br />The fourth theme is the inarticulable emotions the old men feel as they watch these changes.  They are all too strong and experienced to break down, but they each respond in their various ways; frustration, despair, shutting themselves off, living in a hard part of the country with few people, escaping into their own filth, or just plugging onwards, doing their jobs.<br /><br />This last is the theme the movie rests on; how are we supposed to deal with the incredible pain that comes as these sad, strong old men watch their country rip itself to shreds in its shameful depravity?<br /><br />Thankfully, the movie does not suggest a resolution.  If it did, we would lose the art and strain of the question."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"my son does too. we have been watching it again and again and again for the last 3 days, and neither has gotten tired of it yet.<br /><br />why we love it?<br /><br />cause of the way cars are made into persons by means of graphics (the expressions and ""faces"" thay have and make) and acting.<br /><br />cause of the story - it's warm and fuzzy and funny :)<br /><br />cause of the way story is paced; it never gets boring and slow, but it doesn't kill you with the tempo either.<br /><br />cause its beautifully done (not to say ""drawn, cause we know it isn't just drawing any more) - the characters, the details on them, the city, racetrack, nature..<br /><br />one of my all-time favorites."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	What happens when your research leads you consider the existence of a creator?  If you work for the American University Science Research Community you keep your findings to yourself, or risk expulsion.  Stein's documentary is an eye opener for people of faith and those who're unaware of the bias in this system.  The downside, for me. were the vignettes that directed my thoughts to mostly negative images of how I should process the last statement.  I felt manipulated at times.  All in all a very good documentary in that it'll make you think.  I enjoyed Expelled.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I may be dense but it took me awhile before I realized that what I was looking at were the 7 dwarfs. But I have to say that the movie was good  and kept your attention. Very dark so young kids might get frightened but all in all I liked it and I must say all actors fullfilled their misson of entertainment
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I hadn't seen this since it was in cinemas, and found that it's even better than I'd remembered. It's a very unusually-paced film, with a lot of long silences, seemingly-innocuous conversations and dangling plot threads that don't ultimately lead anywhere. In many instances that could make for some infuriating viewing, but in the Coen brothers' hands it all somehow comes together into a master tapestry. The word of the day is suspense, an emotion the brothers have excelled at in the past, and No Country is a glorious example of it at play. The film's three protagonists, retiring sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), stone-cold killer Chigurh (a terrifying, star-making turn for Javier Bardem) and land-living cowboy Moss (Josh Brolin), never actually meet face-to-face but the wake of ripples left in their dueling pursuits is enough to power several movies' worth of rich, intriguing material. Sweaty, intense action walks lockstep with outstanding characterization, top-notch dialog and a hearty dose of respect for the novel. Like many Coen classics, it gets better with each subsequent viewing.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Vampires from the south.  Can you get any better than that.  They have southern accents.  Who would've thought.  This show has very good character developmant.  I like the fact that just dives right into the vampire theme.  Then later on you are introduced to other creatures such as a shape shifter.  This show has many surprises.  It's never boring.  Watch True Blood and you will be happy you did.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I really enjoyed this movie. A lot of action and just enough cheese for everyone in the family to like.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Just when I thought Kendrick couldn't do any better, he did! Excellent movie especially for those needing a marriage rescue. Please watch this movie. You'll be glad you did.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	But the ending left me wanting more. Expected more romance too. Otherwise a very enjoyable spin on the well-loved fairy tale. Empowers Snow White and rescinds the label of damsel in distress.
B002QZ1RS6	1.0	b	there should be an extreme notice for this workout: it is most definitely not for everyone.  if you are already in great shape, and are looking to enhance your workout, then this might just be for you.<br />If you are looking to get into shape, this is most definitely not for you! There is no way that a beginner or intermediate could handle this, which sort of goes against the grain of buying such a product to get back into shape!
B0006989TE	4.0	b	I felt this film was a departure from his previous work and taken on a purely entertainment level it was totally worth watching. Actually there is beautiful storytelling here and a deep love story interwoven with suspense and M.'s signature style-I enjoyed the film and loved the extras-it always amazes me the work that goes into a production of this scale-I don't understand why people are bashing this movie-I realize it's not the sixth sense but it is truly a very good piece of film making.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	I have been very happy overall with Amazon.  However, on this particular item, the DVD Sleeve Cover, although nice, was not the one that is pictured on the Amazon page. The 2 disk edition is good, but I think if your going to picture what your selling--it should be that-and not another sleeve, or a written explanation of why another sleeve was substituted, or telling you that they would send you the sleeve pictured in a separate mailing. In this case they did not. The disks are great, and  I made my own sleeve cover, that depicts the original cover shown on the Amazon page. I probably would think twice about buying a another  DVD from this vendor contracted by Amazon.  This did not happen in my previous order on another DVD, but it was from a different contracted vendor.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	After seeing this film, I have not viewed meat the same and am careful of what and where I buy meat and fish.  The film is going to thoroughly disgust you with regard to what companies are doing in the production of food, not to mention cruelty to animals.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	The atmosphere and mood of this movie are so well done that I can't give it anything less than 3 stars.  And the acting by all the characters was superb.  Unfortunately the story line jumps over the climactic showdown and just comes to an end; I guess some more Coenesque style, but the reasoning escapes me.  Then again, I haven't really cared for any of the Coens' other films, except O Brother Where Art Thou.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"Paradigm shifts have never been popular, especially when involving any type of religious implication (just read some of the other reviews). This documentary makes a strong scientific case in support of intelligent design. The inherent problem, of course, is that intelligent design inevitably leads to a designer, i.e., ""God"", which leads many who refuse to allow God into the science lab to be predisposed to reject any evidence to the contrary. (This is interesting in light of those who say they would believe in God if He would just give them ""proof""? If He did, would His proof be submissible? And maybe He has, and it isn't?) And certainly, while some of the arguments given in this film may be considered biased, what is to be said of the arguments in favor of darwinian evolution? The fact is that there are multiple sound, scientific arguments this film presents in favor of intelligent design that are totally ignored and swept under the proverbial rug by darwinian scientists and philosophers (more often than not, the former are often the latter, also), not to mention critics (just read the reviews - much criticism, little ""proof""; heavy marginalization with lack of significant scientific rebuttal). I am personally partial to options and free choice. I am pleased that someone has finally broken through the ""intelligent design"" checkpoint and presented ""the other side."" At least intelligent people can now weigh things out for themselves instead of being force-fed darwinian evolution. Is there another option for the scientific mind? Yes, there is, and it is presented in this film. Regardless your current position on origins, the information shared in this documentary will make you more intelligent and better informed in darwinism and intelligent design."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"With all the hype over this movie, I was ready for anything while watching this. And I got it. Anything and everything.<br /><br />So far as film making goes....this is boldly different.<br /><br />The stories meld well together, although for me, there was too much Mickey Rourke and not enough Bruce Willis. Jessica Alba was gorgeous in black and white, as was Rosaria Dawson. Sexy!<br /><br />Yummy violence, I liked the story telling, and I liked The imagery of it all, especially ""that yellow bastard"".<br /><br />A really refreshing, really good film. Top 3 of all time."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Terrific workout program  Love the conditioning and I am already seeing terrific results.  The variety and intensity make this program fun and challenging.
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"This is probably the greatest disappointment of the year, if not the decade. Building up hype is a risky game. When you fall; you fall from a really high place. Ridley Scott, the legendary director; the man who gave us the Alien in the first place has done just that. He failed miserably.<br />I do not want to ruin anybody's experience so there are no spoilers here. I just want to share why I am so unhappy with it.<br />Prometheus tries to be too many things and fails at everything it tries to do.<br />Visually it is truly stunning and beautiful. But that's all. Even Avatar had a better and more coherent story. At least it had some characters that were not one-dimensional.<br />Unfortunately, it is not possible to isolate Prometheus from the Alien series and treat it as a stand-alone movie as some are advising us to do. (not that it would save it from being a mediocre film at best). There are too many references to the Alien franchise from the beginning till the end (oh, the horrible horrible end). Prometheus is meant to be a prequel whatever people may say.<br />First of all, with its glorious target of tying everything together, this movie should have been much longer. Diffeent stories and ideas fly from every direction and are simply left there lying untouched as they crash and burn. Mr. Scott, who had shown great mastery in the Alien by not giving too much information and keeping the details to the minimum necessity level has done the opposite here. And this is one of the basic reasons the film fails. There are too many things happening and you don't have the time to absorb them. You never feel immersed. You never feel you are there with the crew. You are not scared. You don't even care when they die.<br />One could have left the movie theater feeling a bit satisfied if at least a few things had made sense. But that, unfortunately, does not happen either.<br />There are movies, where I leave my brain outside so that my intelligence is not insulted. But then, Prometheus claims not to be this kind of a movie. It asks the grandest of questions: Where do we come from? Why? So, is it an intelligent movie? No.<br />Alien was almost philosophical. It was slow. It had this sinister atmosphere which started with the opening scene and the haunting music. And it ended with the same note. There is no suspense, no claustrophobia in Prometheus. No atmosphere at all.<br />With Aliens, we had more action than brains. And we chose not to see the plot holes because the action was so good. I still think Aliens is the best action movie ever. Prometheus doesn't even come close to Aliens.<br />So, where does this leave us? If another director had tackled these questions without trying to tie all the loose ends with one single knot to one of the greatest movies of all time, I could have said: Good effort but mediocre result.<br />When Ridley Scott kills off such a good idea and almost ruins Alien for me; then I say this is unacceptable.<br />Extended review 11/06/2012:<br />Please be warned, there be SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARDS.<br />Having gone through reading more of the positive reviews (and being rather disturbed by the one who called anyone with a negative review as retarded) I thought may be I should share my problems with the movie more openly. If there is anyone who can make some explanation about the below problems I would be most indebted.<br />1. Why would an intelligent humanoid extraterrestrial decide to destroy himself to create life on Earth? Is there no better way? And the Earth looks quite developed at that time. Are all Earthlings their children or is it only us?<br />2. Why would there be a map on Earth for a military base that was meant to destroy Earth? If it was not meant for us why did so many civilizations know about it?<br />3. When you go exploring a planet that may hold the key to one of the greatest questions ever asked do you only take a ragtag band of few scientists?<br />4. How does a geologist who has ""dogs"" that can map an entire structure, get lost in the same structure?<br />5. How does an android know the language of an advanced civilization without prior contact with that civilization?<br />6. Why would there be a 3D recording of what happened to the ""soldiers"" 2000 years ago? How did David know which sequence would start the recording?<br />7. Having seen there is (or was)  something deadly in the structure that killed members of  a more advanced civilization - how can scientists be so ignorant to open doors or touch anything in that structure before thoroughly testing everything?<br />8. Following the same line of thought, how could a biologist be stupid enough to try touching a new life form that has suddenly appeared out of the blue?<br />9. How can a ship's captain be so uncaring about his crew when they are stuck inside an unkown structure with a potential reading from an undetermined lifeform?<br />10. Why would a very advanced race create deadly creatures that need other creatures' wombs to reproduce, as weapons of mass destruction? Wouldn't a specific virus be a better solution? Who would be cleaning up those pests after the attack? Obviously even the Engineers have a problem with controlling these ""weapons"". And yet they keep thousands of cylinders ready to be deployed on their ships.<br />11. We know the xenomorph has an accelerated growth rate and we know it grew to a considerable size quickly in Alien (I always assumed it ate a lot of rats). However, the one that Shaw got out of her body had no food available to it. Yet it was enormous within a few hours. How?<br />12. For me one of the worst scenes was the ending where we see a proto-xenomorph being born. There we see a reference to the horrible AVP: Requiem. It would appear that the xenomorph evolves by taking genes from its host and by creating something else. If so, why didn't we observe the same behavior with human hosts? The proto-xenomorph is born from the body of the Engineer, having obviously evolved further from the white octpussy thingy that grew in Shaw's womb. Yet in all Alien movies humans have been used as hosts but we see no such result (except on Alien 4 where Ripley herself is a genetic mashup of human and xenomorph).<br /><br />I may have made wrong observations or may have reached wrong conclusions. After all, I watched Prometheus only once. I have watched Alien and Aliens may be 20 times each. But these points bugged me and caused me to dislike this movie (and I did want to love it). Am I the only one?"
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	I bought the DVD version, and I wished I'd used my money on something else. They took all the best bits to create the trailer, and that made the movie look like it was going to rock. It didn't. I considered this a huge letdown. I've always loved Theron's acting, but she was just this side of campy trying to fit into the fairytale genre. The movie literally drags in many places...I wondered to myself if I was going to make it through it without falling asleep.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	this is one of the most exciting harry potter adventures yet!  it leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat from the very beginning and takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.  if you like the rest of the harry potter movies, you are sure to enjoy this one.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This is an outstanding Sci-fi series and i cant wait til season 2 comes out on DVD. It has some twist and turns you dont expect, but i really been enjoying the show..
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	I only give it a single star because I can't go any lower! What is wrong with Hollywood? I can't believe they couldn't find something else to vote for. I can't believe I sat there for that long only to watch something that unworthy. Oh, if you like seeing brains flying, blood spraying, cussing every other second, then by all means rent or buy this movie. You will be thrilled. If you are looking for a good movie keep looking!
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	Great special effects, but story sucked! I watched and somewhat enjoyed it, the effects were well done. But if you are looking for that modernized version of a true classic story, or anything resembling a well written story, you will be sorely disappointed!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!!!!  I love this guy, he is the funniest I have seen in years!!  I recomend him to everyone, if you are looking to laugh, this is it, make sure you don't have stitches... Great for cancer patients and their families!!  You can check out some samples at YouTube. YOU GO JEFF!!!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"What better tale to tell than that of an irascible, vain, honorable, loveable, and emotionally available, ordinary man rising to heights even beyond his own imagination, with and because of the deeply felt love and vital support of a woman like the inimitable Abigail Adams, without whom John himself knew, he would have been a lesser man. Thanks to their own collected letters, numerous writers, most importantly here, McCullough's fine book - the story of John and Abigail Adams is one of the best American love stories imaginable. Every element of this production - actors, script, direction, cinematography - is a testament to the inspiration of the material and the professional artistry of everyone involved. And the bonus - it is America's history with all the warts, all the well-deserved glory, and all the sadly tragic, yet inspiring reality. On a level with ""Brideshead Revisited,"" ""Tinker, Tail, Soldier Spy"" (original), and most recently ""Downton Abbey,"" ""John Adams"" is an example of the emotional power and and intellectual reward that can be reaped from dedication to the screen arts! What flaws there are - and they are few - are, as expected with anyone you might observe so closely, easily forgivable for the pleasure of their company."
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	Great movie.  It shows how we can get caught up in our lives and ourselves and forget about those around us who are important to us. It will inspire you to do better.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I gave this movie 4 stars cause it was much better than what I thought it would be. Kristen Stewart is sexy.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I wrote a review for cars two.  My cable went out the grandkids missed seeing cars two.  I thought the store carry DVDs no they were sold out.  I found cars two at a great price. So, to make up the mess up of not seeing cars two.  I was able to order cars one and cars two used at the price one cars DVD movie cost. Kids love it.  Thank-you for used working as good as new, at half the price. Thank-you.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This was a Christmas present for my dad--something kids and adults alike would enjoy.
B001OHS8BQ	3.0	b	"I was told this was a good movie, and like others saw the reviews. So I gave it a chance. I made it 20 minutes and shut it off. The acting was atrocious. It seemed Kirk Cameron's father and best friend from the firehouse was the same character. And they only talked in ""sermons"" about Jesus Christ.<br />I was then told that the ending is ""Great!"". I reluctantly tried again to watch it. This time I did. The message is very good. Yet the acting?..... Sorry but I know the actors weren't paid for their participation but I'm betting that there are some decent ones out there that would be willing to volunteer. The dialogue, Like ""Fighting the Giants"" was horrible. These movies really only attract both partial believers and full on believers. There's really no attempt to draw in those without faith. That's were this movie falls short of ""Good"".<br /><br />It's the Christian base that stereotypes the none believers. They are thicker skinned than what this movie shows.<br /><br />The plus though was that Kirk can still act. And if he wants to play a 16 year old kid... He can probably still pull that one off with his little boy looks."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Jeff's alter egos are absolutely hilarious!  My husband and I laughed so hard we were crying...  These ""personalities"" take a life of their own, it's easy to forget they're actually ventriloquist's dummies.<br /><br />And make sure you check out the outtakes, more laughs for your money, be sure of that."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I loved the books and have greatly enjoyed the films. This was a wonderful example of mixed media. The films get darker as they progress and captivate as well as the books. (Can movies ever really do as well as the books they come from?) Anyway, I've loved this magical expedition as an adult, and older adult yet, and will look forward to retracing the journey from time to time.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My kids, grandkids, friends and I loved the film in the theater.  I ordered one for every family member that had children.  The ages vary from 2 yrs old to 21 yrs. All loved the film.  Was able to order in advance, and saved money!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out, but it looked so much better at home. The BluRay 1080P added so much more detail to the film. The deep blacks in the background and the vibrant colors gave the picture a realness that I didn't get in the movie theater. I was sort of dissapointed that the sound track wasn't in Dolby TruHD or DTS Master Audio, but after I got into the movie I never gave it another thought.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Very much enjoyed this movie. Didn't get a chance to see it in the movies, but had friends over for the viewing and they commented how much it was like being at the movies.  I have HD and Surround which brought the movie to life.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	The blu-ray disc I ordered came quickly, I know I always get great service with Amazon. And although I am probably the last person to watch the movie - I really enjoyed it! Nice to know I can get great products and a good price and get them quickly.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Jeff has a funny routine. His characters include ""Walter"", a sort of elderly curmudgeon; ""Sweet Daddy D"" - sorry, that's ""Sweeeeeeeeet Daddy D"", a playa in management position (PIMP); ""Peanut"", described as a South Pacific islander but could really be some alien; ""Jose Jalapeno"", a Cuban condiment (on a ""steeeeek""); and ""Bubba J"", a slow-witted beer-guzzling NASCAR aficianado.<br /><br />Some of the jokes might be a bit politically incorrect, but as Jeff and ""Shrek 2""-director friend surmise in the optional commentary, they are accepted because they are spoken by a puppet, not a human.<br /><br />I watched it twice (on successive nights) and loaned it to a friend who thought it was bleeping hilarious and also is going to watch it again before returning it.<br /><br />You get the option of a ""bleeped"" or ""unbleeped"" version.<br />Extras include a commentary, a couple bloopers, and a video of Jeff's dog humping one particular puppet."
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	I got this movie for free when I bought my DVD player and finally sat down to watch it.  My husband and I turned it off after about 20 minutes because the language was so horrible.  I am not kidding when I say that every other word in this movie is the f word.  I have watched so many movies without foul language and they can be just as powerful and entertaining to watch as the the movies with foul language.  So why ruin a good story with this language?  I wish Hollywood would realize that not everyone speaks this way and that it is offensive.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I'm not an action hero junkie (grew up with superman and batman -seen the movies and enjoyed)- however, love Robert Downey Jnr. My son encouraged me to see the movie, said i'd like it. Well, I did and i did! It held my interest from the very beginning, right to the end. Great acting, great plot. lots of exciting action etc etc. Just plain enjoyable and total escapism. Great Stuff. See it! Get it!
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	There is not much to add to the movie itself as one can get ample reviews anywhere. So my comments is on this blu-ray disc. The picture is highly detailed, and the surround sound is amazing. The disc has some deleted scenes and a feature on the score compsition. But its pretty basic. If you want the whole works, look for other richer editions. This is good for the casual collector.
B002QZ1RS6	1.0	b	I was disappointed in the Plyomentric DVD that didnt work (bought used from BOOKS FOR EVERYBODY), disk was unreadable in multiple DVD players. The back of the DVD doesnt look scratched so I suspect it was burnt.  So far the other DVD's worked but I havent made it through all of them yet.  Everything was included in the set but still a let down.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	The movie fireproof really touched my heart and it also made my friend cry along with me and the end of the movie was very touching when the father was talking with the guy about his faith and I would recomend people getting this movie and watching it as a family.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham has the most awesome talent in that, by giving his puppets such varied personalities, he makes you fell that they are almost ""alive"". This, as well as his older DVD, is a ""must see"" for anyone needing a great laugh!"

B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I think this was the best of Potter films - and don't try to compare it to the book!  There will always be variation from page to screen.  In terms of the film itself, it's really the most entertaining of the 6 that have so far been released.  The younger actors seem to find their stride a little more in this film.  They are all becoming a little more ambiguous, and therefore more interesting.  I also find this story to have been the best of the books because the Severus Snape character becomes so controversial, and he was always my favorite, and when played by my favorite actor, Alan Rickman, the universe makes sense for one shining moment.<br /><br />Regarding the DVD release:  If you haven't heard, Ultimate Editions of the Harry Potter films are going to be released beginning with the first two films on 8 December.  These movies are longer and have the deleted scenes added back into the films themselves - much like the versions that crop up on ABC Family.  Just like the LOR films, the length of the movies appears to get longer with each release.  I believe the Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone will be about 7 minutes longer, while the second movie is supposed to be about 16 minutes longer (something like that).  Unless you just really want the mask, wait and get the ultimate edition - if you can wait that long.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Poetry fans tend to make much of the original source of the the title--W. B. Yeats' ""Sailing to Byzantium,"" in which the aging narrator wishes to exchange his hard life in Ireland (""that country"") for an imaginary aesthetic existence in ancient Byzantium, with its mosaic temples and golden sculptures.  But neither the novelist (Cormac McCarthy) nor the Coen brothers are promising any sort of deliverance through poetry, art or any other imagined alternative to mortal existence.  This isn't a story for elitist intellectuals and interpreters of Yeats' frequently arcane visions (some of my students even find the poem downright ""wacky"").  On the other hand, the movie is not merely a story for those in need of a couple of hours of escape (though I frankly found the basic plot and characters so entertaining I was hanging on to my seat with white knuckles to the very end).<br /><br />But the story is the Coen brothers' ""bait"" to get the viewer to think about non-trivial matters.  After all, it's only we humans who are blessed with ""self-consciousness""-- with the capacity to think about our individual ""identities,"" and even about our own life and death (though the beauty of good movies is that further inquiry into ""deep meanings"" is an option, not a requirement).  Personally, I choose to take the bait and the next step: what's the point of the story?  what's the ""meaning"" of what we've just seen?  After some (not much) deliberation, I'd offer the following ""translation"" of the title (sorry about the wordiness): the older we get in this finite, temporary world, the more conscious we become of our mortality and death.  Some of us pretend we can beat it; most of us see it as irrational and unfair; practically all of us avoid or at least postpone thoughts about the subject, instead preferring to wait around and see what happens.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones says toward the end of the story that he's quitting as sheriff.  He had expected ""God to somehow come into his life"" but is now too fully aware that God (much less he himself) is over-matched.  The film's nemesis is a merciless ""executioner"" with less conscience than The Terminator and sufficient inscrutability to make even Woody Harrelson's perceptive diagnosis of him (as a psychopathic killer with principles, albeit devoid of ""morality"") inadequate.  In short, the film is a version of an Ingmar Bergman film like ""Through a Glass Darkly"" or an earlier, better-known film like Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal""--the primary difference being that the Coen Brothers' filmic and narrating style is more apt to catch the attention of a larger, ""non-academic"" audience.  It's doubtful many of those who see the film will be satisfied with the conclusion.  In fact, there is no closure, thus breaking an unwritten rule of all cinema.  Recall how Hitchock has a shrink appear at the end of ""Psycho"" to explain in logical terms the character of Norman Bates (and practically everything we've just seen).  When the 1919 German expressionistic film, ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" played before American audiences, an actor was hired to appear on stage at the end of the movie to assure us that the monstrous killer-psychopath was now completely cured (no need to worry about guys like Hitler).  And so we would all like to believe--about extended life-spans, the ""cures"" of medicine, the progress of science.  But the older you get--and the more inquisitive--the more you realize that the advertisers-promoters-money-hungry pharmaceutical companies, cosmetic surgeons, ""powerful"" positive thinkers--have sold us all a bill of goods.  Like the characters in the film, they're as likely as us not to know what's going to happen next, pretending that life is an open and free proposition and that we could be one of the ""lucky ones,"" awaiting the equivalent of personal fame and fortune if not immortality.<br /><br />Josh Brolin appears to be the sympathetic ""hero""--flawed by greed and, like the characters of ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" making what could be a fatal mistake.  Yet he has a John Wayne-like rugged individualism, a knack for survival, and commands instant respect from those around him once they learn of his service in ""Nam""--but that won't get you diddly in the relentless, fatalistic, flip-of-a-coin determinism that, in the Coen Brothers' view of modern existence, controls our lives.  Brolin's conscience requires him to return to the scene of a crime with water for the survivor of a drug deal gone terribly bad, yet he can dismiss his wife's concerns for her mother. And in this instance we as the audience can afford to dismiss them as well.  By this time we're conditioned to expect such  a remark to be followed by the Executioner's (Javier Bardem--looking like a smaller but more chilling version of Schwarznegger or Andre the Giant) quick extermination of the person so named via his powerful weapon with its menacing silencer.  But that would follow a certain pattern of logic--instead she dies of cancer.  And when our leading contender for hero is momentarily distracted by a sunbathing babe in long shot, there's no need any longer to even play out the execution. We see a dead body floating in the motel's pool (motels outnumber ""homes"" by a considerable margin in this movie--as mortal beings, we're all ""transients,"" whether we know it or not, whether we've paid a mortage or not.<br /><br />Brolin's wife suddenly becomes a central figure, but only briefly.  She at least has no illusions about getting a lucky roll of the dice.  Her fate, like that of all mortals, is preordained, and she refuses to play the Executioner's coin-flip game, calling it more accurately: ""It's not me or the coin that decides what happens to me.  It's you.""  But in this circular question about free will and the meaning of life, Bardem answers her back: ""You're wrong.  That's how I got here.""  In other words, each of us could not have been born had the slightest circumstance been changed on the night (or whenever) we were conceived.  And who knows why we were born as human beings and not cats?  It's all a game of chance, and there isn't even an authentic card dealer. (The viewer can only speculate why the Executioner sees his own dicy birth as license to reverse the process--serving as the agent of hastening death for all.  Is he sparing his victims Kierkegaard's characterization of mortality as a ""sickness onto death""--a charitable interpretation, yet his actions practically resist characterization as ""evil"" due to their irreversible and mechanical necessity).  But its through this mysterious (and deadly) character that the movie destroys all of our illusions and ultimately goes after the worst of the deadly sins--about which, even after the Bible and all the world's important literature and religions, we lack awareness: pride, hubris, taking upon ourselves what belongs only to God.  When will we learn?  Why can't we?  Why must we be so prideful in the face of more violence, terrorism, and destruction?<br /><br />But therein lies the film's admission of Aristotle's ""fatal flaw"" and along with it the small ray of light in the film (along with some moments of humor, which even the critics seem to have missed).  Brolin, after all, did make a mistake and had the arrogance to think he could get away with his theft of the drug money intended for someone else.  And for a moment, he let carnal desire distract him from the real threat.  Moreover, he took his own life more seriously than that of his wife or mother-in-law, by assuming that the Nemesis-Executioner was interested ""only"" in him!  But you simply can't take for granted the next move of this Executioner, who passes up an opportunity to snuff out the sheriff, Tommy Lee Jones (the closest thing to an authentic hero). Not being detected could be a motive, but is it possible he senses in the sheriff greater realism and honesty than in any of the other characters?<br /><br />The last two scenes do nothing to prepare the spectator for an end, but they do practically ""require"" interpretation (witness the complaints from the numerous reviewers who trash the entire film because it doesn't end as they might like).  I like happy endings, and I'm frequently impatient when things don't go my way, but I'm afraid that in this story, especially, those viewers who simply refuse to discuss, think about, or interpret a disturbing moment (or even a fictional movie!) are told  to shape up or ship out. The Executioner (quite vulnerable himself, by the way, but a better survivor than Harrelson or Brolin) walks away.  Behind him he leaves the seeds of greed (and of fatal pride) in a young boy who took money (from the Nemesis, naturally) in exchange for what began as a Good Samaritan act.  Next on the agenda of the recovered Executioner, who ambles off into a typical American neighborhood (like that in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"") who knows what or whom?--the sheriff?  His are the last words as he reports a dream about meeting his father (who did not die an old man), and then says: ""I woke up.""  That awakening is what this movie is all about. The screen goes black waiting for the spectator's inner light to come on.  It's time to wake up--perhaps now more than ever.  There may be a future, but there will be no lottery tickets--even to those who win them.  It's we who must act to make the best of that mortally-defined fateful span of existence that lies before us.  We can't know if our efforts will bear positive fruit, but we can know that ""good"" isn't simply going to happen by wishing and waiting for it.  And we can also know that our prideful moments can only bring more misery.  And if we don't know this now, the storyteller seems to be saying, we most certainly will either know it, or feel the effect, when we're older.<br /><br />But this may too rigid, or unforgiving, an interpretation. Thinkers like Kierkegaard, Tillich, O'Connor, Ingmar Bergman had no illusions about the lack of theological curiosity residing in human beings.  Yet they also accepted Socrates' insistence that ""the unexamined life is unfit to be lived,"" knowing that fatal pride is born of presumptuous ignorance, not of open inquiry).  Created with the unique ability to question, to examine, and to know, humans often appear practically eager to forfeit this ""gift"" (we can be thankful most of the world's great religions make room for a God of grace--a Deity extending love to those who may not have the opportunity for rigorous examining of one's self and surroundings).<br /><br />For those who prefer a less theological interpretation, the emphasis on ""land"" in the title provides it.  Why would the storyteller select as a setting for this parable about modern-day America a vast, open, dry and sterile wasteland?  Reminiscent of T. S. Eliot's modernist poem ""The Wasteland"" or Italian film director Michelangelo Antonioni's critique of present-day America (""Zabriskie Point""), the setting repeatedly points to a vacuum, a void, a land laid waste by the same human beings it once nurtured and empowered.  Everyone wants answers.  We have the power to find them, but only if we're not too complacent or proud to search for them."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6EK3S"">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Two-Disc Special Edition) (Harry Potter 4)</a> is my favorite of the series, but this one came pretty close. It was a great adaptation, considering how long the book is.<br /><br />Pretty much everything worked great for me, except the first scenes of the dementor attack, i think it could have been so much better and more intense.<br /><br />The rest is great, Imelda Stauton was amazing as Dolores Umbridge, a great performance, i hope they bring her back for the seventh movie, would be great to see her again.<br /><br />It doesnt have much action but is ok, is mostly character driven. The trio has improved their craft, especially Daniel Radcliffe, although the best of the three is still Emma Watson.<br /><br />The special effects were incredible, especially in the ministry battle, wich in my opinnion was the best scene of the movie. The music was great.<br /><br />Overall a good movie, the DVD is great, could have had more extras like the goblet of fire dvd, but is satisfying."
B00447G29S	4.0	b	"Christmas makes saps of us all, and if Hollywood knows how to do anything it's how to make a few nickels from our sappery - how else can you explain Playboy bunny Jenny McCarthy having not one but two holiday movies playing on The Family Channel (!) this year?<br /><br />So it was only a matter of time before America's most beloved movie star, Tom Hanks, found his way into America's most beloved holiday.  Re-teaming with Robert Zemeckis (they previously worked together on two little independent films you might have seen, ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Cast Away""), Hanks gets to play five different roles thanks to motion-capture technology and Zemeckis's desire to push digital filmmaking to new frontiers.  It's a bit of a distraction for the adults who keep trying to find Tom Hanks in the various digital characters, but since it's Tom Hanks we don't care too much (we also don't care that his train conductor's Chicago accent ebbs and flows like the tide).<br /><br />But ""The Polar Express"" is a kids movie and should be judged accordingly.  On that level, ""TPE"" is a near-triumph.  Our hero, an unnamed boy of around 10-12 years old, is doubting Santa on Christmas Eve.  He is old enough to spot the chinks in Santa's armor he is in danger of Not Believing In Santa.  Then, as he searches for slumber on Christmas Eve, a huge old-fashioned locomotive pulls up in front of his house, somewhat shocking because there are no train tracks.  He reluctantly climbs aboard and is off on an adventure of a lifetime, rocketing down the tracks towards the North Pole along with several other kids in various stages of Christmas skepticism.<br /><br />Visually, ""TPE"" is a stunner, whether it's capturing the beauty of a winter countryside, churning your stomach as the train shoots down a 179-degree grade at Glacier Gulch, or meandering through Santa's charming red-brick home town at the North Pole.  This is animation that's one step away from reality, in a good way.<br /><br />Sure, there are some glitches.  A quick song-and-dance number serves as a reminder (along with Richard Gere's performance in ""Chicago"") that not all movie stars are ready for musicals.  The Josh Groban ballad ""Believe"" gets a little tired, and the appearance of Steven Tyler from Aerosmith as an elf to sing ""Rockin' on Top of the World"" reeks of a blatant attempt to increase soundtrack sales.<br /><br />All things considered, while ""TPE"" is not going to knock either the Grinch (cartoon version) or ""A Christmas Story"" from their perches  as the top Christmas movies, it's a proud addition to the family DVD library - a welcome excuse to ignore the latest holiday pseudo-entertainment from secondary ""talents"" like Ms. McCarthy."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"A great movie.  Based on a great book.<br /><br />To those complaining about it being too short,<br />bear in mind the first director said<br />""Ms. Rowlings has 750 pages to tell her<br />story, I have 75.  And after the first two<br />movies the suits at Warner Bros. decreed that<br />the movies had to be under two hours.  So the<br />director had his hands tied."
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	my daughter received this movie as a birthday present.  She was SO excited that she jumped up and down when she got it.<br />She likes the idea of having all the discs included since she thought that she was only going to get 2 like in the stores<br />I have only had 1 problem with all of my Amazon orders and that was quickly rectified to my liking.

B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	I was completely blew away by this film. I am a huge fan of the first Alien and this film finally answered a few questions about where the xenomorph derives from. I will not tell much about this film only that it is definitely one of the best films of the year. It was also nice to see Ridley Scott return to the genre which he does the best. This film is definitely a must see for sci-fi/Alien film fans. I would categorize it as one of the best sci-fi films ever made and definitely the best of the 21st century.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I'm a fan of Marvel comics, have been since I was a kid. After X-MEN, Fantastic 4, Spider Man and the Hulk flicks, I thought Iron man might be scraping the bottom of the barrel. Boy, was I wrong. I think it's one of the best, out of all the comic-book-to-big-screen releases. Dark Knight has no equal, it's probably not fair to throw that in the mix. We all know who's Number One. But this movie was great!!!!<br />This is absolutely on my short list of movies I can watch over and over, and I can't wait to do that on my PS3, surround sound and really, really big TV!
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	"Once again the Oscars prove that they have no ability to label what is a ""good"" and entertaining movie.  This is the biggest over-hyped, 2-hour long ""AVERAGE"" movie I have seen in quite some time.  I love movies, love them...and in my opinion have a very wide range of tolerances towards movies that want to bring the viewer into the film, surround them with characters and scenarios, but those wonderful movies also leave you at the end with closure.<br /><br />I understand this was an ""artistic"" movie as so many other people have commented.  But to say that it is a theatrical masterpiece is pushing the limits!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie has been a huge hit! Not only at home with my three younger children, but also with my class at school.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I love this movie, not only because it proves that liberals are intolerant, but also because it intelligently shows another view of creation.  Liberals keep saying that water found in another planet means there was life, BUT, if chlorine is found, does that mean washing machines used to exist there?  If water is found that means that Oxygen and Hydrogen exit and nothing more.  A single cell will not become an elephant no more than the pine trees in my yard will become peach trees, tulips or dinosaurs.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"While Jeff Dunham performs very adult comedy, he is not so abrasive as some modern comedians.  Using a minimal amount of ""cussing"" and ""politically insensitive"" dialouge, he still comes out HILAREOUS!!!!!  I enjoyed all of his characters, my favorite of course being Peanut.  Very talented, very funny."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	For the hopelessness you feel while watching this film, that you have no choice but to take what these food producers are stuffing down our throats, at the end the filmmaker provides very sensible suggestions FOR making a difference.  Its true - we are the consumers, and what we purchase, the choices we make, are our votes.  I'm vegan and choose organic over non when possible... even household products, I will buy those which are more environmentally friendly.  I am one person, but if we all did the same, we would have a huge impact, as the filmmaker suggests.  He is right - we are kept from knowing where our food comes from, what is in it, how it is processed, and the black practices which have pervaded the industry - the we need to educate ourselves is a given.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	seriously folks this movie won best picture??? maybe I'm from another planet or something because I just watched this movie and THIS MOVIE SUCKS.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I like the movie overall - they did a great job with the idea behind the movie.  However, there we so many times I felt like I was watching poorly played out scenes from Twilight.  I so wish that girl would learn how to act!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I cooked a cheap roast one day and when I cut into it I KNEW it wasn't right.  I had heard about meat glue and read more about it that night.  I am convinced this is what the roast was composed of: a congealed slurry of meat pieces, blood & cellulose.  Oh it tasted fine, and it was really tender - THAT'S how I knew something wasn't right.  But since US labeling laws do not require meat packers to mention its use, I will never know for sure.  Ever since that day I have decided to know more about where our food comes from.  We rely more & more on our own garden & raise chickens.  I buy organic and unprocessed whenever possible.  This movie was profound not only in how it exposed the slurry that goes into our food but also the criminality of the corporations in bed with our government.  I will recommend this movie to everyone.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"&lt;strong>Prometheus&lt;/strong> (Ridley Scott, 2012)<br /><br />You know what? If &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> had been directed by anyone other than Ridley Scott, or if it hadn't been marketed as an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> prequel--I am working on the hypothesis that it originally was not, and the &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> elements were retrofitted either at the insistence of the studio or when Scott and Spaits/Lindelof realized how much there was in common there--we wouldn't be having any of the discussions we are currently having about this movie. We'd probably be pretty united in hailing it as one of the more inventive (if derivative), and certainly one of the most technically accomplished, science fiction movies in recent memory, probably the best sci-fi movie since &lt;em>Cube&lt;/em> almost fifteen years ago. From a technical standpoint, &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> is unassailable; the acting is pitch-perfect, the direction is exactly what one would expect form the guy who brought you &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Bladerunner&lt;/em>, every member of the crew brought his or her A game, the 3D is hands-down the best I've seen since &lt;em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams&lt;/em> (and is used much in the same way, to my delight). In short, this is the type of movie for which the word ""sumptuous"" was coined. Forget all that Merchant-Ivory boondoggle. (After all, what are sci-fi films if not period dramas for periods that haven't happened yet?) It is, in short, an impressive achievement by any empirical yardstick one would choose to measure it with.<br /><br />The problem is, of course, that it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> directed by Ridley Scott, and even if you hadn't caught all the in-jokes and references in the script before you hit the final sequence, well, when you get to that point there's no denying this is an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> movie. (And in a movie that seemed awfully retrofitted, that final sequence was the most garishly tacked-on bit. But I am getting ahead of myself.) Now, while I am a pretty darned big fan of the Alien series, or at least the first three movies (I still to this day have not gotten round to seeing &lt;em>Alien Resurrection&lt;/em>, despite pretty much everyone I know telling me how much better it is than &lt;em>Alien&lt;supr>3&lt;/supr>&lt;/em>, a movie I actually quite liked), and even the one guy in the room who actually enjoyed &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> for the stupid fun fanboy movie it was, I'm still a casual fan of the series as opposed to a true &lt;em>otaku&lt;/em>. You kind of have to be, in order to enjoy the big stuff-blows-up stupidity of &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> in any way.<br /><br />There's also another layer to this, and one that most people don't seem to have thought about, but that's come up a few times in my discussions on the movie since I saw it Friday night (I'm writing this on the following Monday afternoon); there's a meta layer that was absent from the other films. And perhaps I'm overstepping the bounds here, but it seems to me that Scott and co., and specifically Avy Kaufman, who cast Noomi Rapace as a character named Elizabeth (and in at least one place during an action scene, an actor slips up and calls her character Lisbet), pretty much invited this meta layer into the film. And it casts an interesting light on what has become one of the movie's big controversies. But again, I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />NOTE: There is one thing revealed in the synopsis that I can't believe is a spoiler, though there is a scene in the film that leads me to believe it was meant that way. If you are especially spoiler-sensitive, you may want to skip over the synopsis.<br /><br />Plot: two sceintists, Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace, rocketed to fame through playing Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (&lt;em>Devil&lt;/em>'s Logan Marshall-Green), uncover what would seem to be a star map in the cave paintings and stone carvings of half a dozen, maybe more, ancient civilizations. Thanks to new-and-improved 2089 technology, they pinpoint the exact star system those paintings depict.<br /><br />[Problem #1: 35,000+ years later, the positions of some of those stars will have changed; after a tenth of that, some of the Greek constellations have lost their original shapes to modern eyes.]<br /><br />So Weyland Technologies, headed up by the very, very old Peter Weyland (&lt;em>The Adventures of Priscilla&lt;/em>'s Guy Pearce, and I'd be tempted to ask him which film had the tougher make-up job) and his ice-queen daughter Meredith Vickers (&lt;em>Monster&lt;/em>'s Charlize Theron), send a ship out to this star system, which happens to contain one very earth-like moon revolving a Saturn-like planet. The ship contains seventeen crew members, including various scientists, navigators, Vickers as the Weyland Technologies representative, and an android named David (&lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>'s Michael Fassbender) who learns human mannerisms from watching old movies obsessively, but, as a hologram of Weyland reminds us during the mission briefing, has no soul. Holloway and Shaw believe this planet to be the home of a race they call the Engineers--advanced beings who created the human race. When they get to the planet they do indeed find evidence that something other than nature has been there (""God does not create in straight lines,"" as Holloway tells us), but of course, what they are seeking and what they find are two entirely different things...<br /><br />As regards the meta I spoke of earlier, and its particular application to &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em>: Michael Fassbender garnered a great deal of critical acclaim for his role in &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>, playing a sex addict. An interesting choice to play the role of an asexual robot, especially when so many of your audience members leave asking themselves (or the people they were with) ""was David gay?"". It's a frankly ridiculous question to even be asking, and while half of me doubts that 90%+ of the people involved in the debate are even aware &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em> exists, it still feels like that particular casting choice forced the issue, rather like not changing the name of Noomi Rapace's character. And I've been mulling on this for days without being able to come up with another motive than ""provide non-controversy to get butts in seats."" Which seems to be working, but it feels a little disingenuous.<br /><br />But you know what else? I'm going to ask you to forget all that. I'm also going to ask you to forget about all those plot holes that aren't really plot holes (if you're watching the movie on DVD, pause it when they reveal the designation of the planet, then go back and watch the first &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em>; they're two different, albeit somehow related, planets), forget about the anachronisms that make this ship so much technologically cooler (despite predating it) than the Nostromo, forget this movie is in any way related to the Alien franchise, which it actually &lt;em>is&lt;/em> possible to do until you get to that last sequence that drove me up the wall. Instead, focus on the other obvious source material from which they drew when writing this script: &lt;em>2001&lt;/em>. All the stuff about exploration and the dawn of man and all that. That, to me, is where the core of this film lay: in the sense of wonder at the discoveries they were making. &lt;em>That&lt;/em> is what this movie was about, and in that, it succeeded as well as it could given the script tinkering and retrofitting and all the other silliness. All of which means this is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is a lovely one, and worth seeing. *** "
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This documentary is an eye-opening view into the US food industry that every person that doesn't produce ALL of their own food MUST see! The only documentary that I can honestly say is more eye-opening would be Earthlings, which can be seen for free at [...].
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	The books are always better.  Always.  Yet I feel compelled to watch any movie or show based on a book I liked and usually spend the whole time cringing.  In this case though, the show managed to provide some solid entertainment without mutilating the characters and the story.  There are definitely places where it slips into melodramatic corniness but for the most part its really enjoyable and definitely worth watching.  I'm excited about season two and will be buying this season for dvd.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Im so sick of music playing throughout the entire movie... its a new fad and it really should cease and desist. Playing a soundtrack in the background of your movie throughout the entire film doesnt make the movie more dramatic, it makes it more desperate. This is my opinion, of course.
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	"The premise for this tale is not dissimilar from other Pixar/Disney pictures.  The plot begins with at the Final race that will determine who is the best of three cars and the winner of the much touted Piston Cup: 1.  The current champion in his last race; 2. The one who has always been a step behind; and 3. the young rookie in his very first season.  The race unconvincingly ends in a 3-way-tie partly caused by the rookie's (Lightning McQueen) cockiness.  The result is another race in California, winner take all.  The story finally gets moving when Lightning gets separated from his trailer (MACK), and sentenced to repairing the road in a sleepy town off old Route 66.<br /><br />This moving is a far cry from Finding Nemo and The Incredibles that involved parent/child relationships, but it holds its own.  Lightning must learn that his cocky attitude and always wanting to work alone has left him searching for ""an empty cup"".  There are also some great characters to meet along the way.  Tow Mater is a dim-witted tow truck that likes to go ""Tractor-Tipping"".  Sally, a sleek and sexy Porsche Carrera, owns the local motel.  Doc Hudson the local town judge has some secrets of his own. A hippie VW van and an old WWII era Army jeep add a running joke.  Unfortunately, we never quite feel that Lightning has learned his lesson until the end.  Most of the characters don't ever truly worm their way into your heart.<br /><br />Visually, this movie is breathtaking. During some scenes it is nearly impossible to tell that you're watching an animated film.  The race sequences are heart stopping.  And one event as a forgotten town lights up in the glorious neon glow of 40 years ago will leave many parents smiling.  Also, everything in this movie is related to cars:  there are flying VW bugs instead of flies; the cars do the ""wave"" by revving up and flashing their headlights; characters go ""tractor-tipping"" instead of cow tipping, and drink oil at the local drive-in diner.<br /><br />Parents should know that some of the scenes are intense and several of the Chrome and Fiberglass extras are violently taken out of the scene and crunched, though none seem to be seriously injured.  Talk to children about why Doc Hudson believes that Lightning is after an empty cup, and ask what the difference is between the ways ""yeah, okay"" is said and what they mean.  What did Lightning really learn from all this?  Parents may also want to talk to their children about Historic Route 66 and its impact on the Country.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good film, with flashy effects and a catchy sound track then this is it.  If, like me, you love all things Disney, then see this as an appetizer for Pirates.  And make sure you stay through the end of the credits."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Everyone should see this DVD, it honestly tells us what they do to the animals and food we eat and serve to our famlies.<br />We should stand up for what we cook and eat,and to what is sold to us as consumers.People need to know what is in what they are buying and spending their hard earned money on.<br />As consumers if we stand up then organic farming would come more abundant and affordable. As consumers, we all could afford to buy healthy and good food and we all deserve accounability in what is being sold to us. All for our health and we desrve it! We would spend less money on doctors and hospitals.<br />Stand up America!
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	"This film is directed by the famous Coen brothers who also wrote the screenplay adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy.  It is dark and brooding story and the suspense is so thick that it kept me squirming uncomfortably in my seat throughout.  Indeed, it is a fine film, artistic in every way.  It's already won a whole bunch of awards and will certainly make it into the Oscar nominations this year.<br /><br />John Brolin plays the role of Llewelin Moss, a simple working-class welder, and occasional hunter who accidentally comes across a murder scene in the Texas desert.  The inhabitants of several trucks are all dead or dying and there is a satchel of money from what looks like a drug deal gone bad.  Llewelin grabs the money and runs and the rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between him and Javia Bardem, cast as Anton Chiguh, the personification of evil itself.  Llewelin is way over his head as he matches wits with Chiguh, whose deadly weapon of choice is air gun which is usually used to kill cattle. Tommy Lee Jones is cast as the aging and wise sheriff.  He tries to stop the mayhem but is powerless against it.<br /><br />I didn't like the plot.  I want good people to win.  I want a resolution.  I want a tidy ending that I understand.  I don't like leaving the theater and feeling that the conclusion was just a cop out by the author who wrote himself into a hole and, because he couldn't figure out an ending, kills off a lot of people and then decides to let the viewers figure it all out for themselves.  O.K.  I know this is art.  I also know that I can find a book or a film satisfying either in spite of, or sometimes because of, this kind of world view.  But it the case of ""No Country for Old Men"", all I felt was annoyance and depression.<br /><br />I cannot say this was a bad film.  Film buffs will appreciate it.  The directing and acting were impeccable.  And even though the 122 minute-runtime seemed to move at a snail's pace, there wasn't a wasted motion or expression.  And so, even though I appreciate the artistic impulses that went into this film, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I usually don't recommend DVD's to people but Jeff Dunham is the best. This DVD will make you laugh out loud. He makes you think the puppets are real. At times you could swear they are all talking at once. PLEASE enjoy this DVD.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	"Call me immature but Im not. When I was young, I was totally freaked out with santa, I cried and cried everytime I sat on his lap. But the thihng is, writing a review on this not so good movie has ntohing got to do with my bad experiences...<br /><br />The polar express is When a doubting young boy takes an extraordinary train ride to the North Pole, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery that shows him that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe.<br /><br />what makes this movie so great is (eerr) the CGI. The background and the special effects are dazzalling amd sometimes exciting. But the thing is, Though the movie is visually stunning overall, but the animation for the human characters isn't lifelike enough, and the story is quite...... odd.<br /><br />There was no heart to this story... no soul to makes us feel warm in our bodies.... but It really exposed the coldness of the movie and litterally coldness of the north pole...<br /><br />I found this movie quite scary. Santa is scary... the north pole is scary. Wouldn't they have frozen to death?<br /><br />I don't know... theres something not right about this movie.. ignoring the fact santa clause is evil and BIG AND SCARY RED DEVIL!... BUT!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Its not the right kind of movie that would score an A+, nor A nor B+ nor B nor C+ nor C nor D+ not D Nor E+ but a nice ""E"".<br /><br />The reason for such a low score is because this movie does not live up to its trailer.. and it tries to hard to become a nice holiday movie...<br /><br />heres a funny quote from a reviewer and I agree:<br /><br />""Now it can be said, Santa Claus is a fascist dictator who likes to kidnap and endanger children so that they can learn the true value of Christmas.""<br /><br />-- Michelle Alexandria, ECLIPSE MAGAZINE<br /><br />p.s: not only santa is scary, the whole animated characters are dead freaky.. like zombies back to life in pastic form! EW"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"I personally have never liked Downing, but he was quite good in this movie. Some of the Marvel Comics do make up into a good action movie. This one was no exception. All of the other players were also good in their parts. By the ending,I must assume the producers intend to make a second ""Iron Man "", and I'm certain it will be well attended.<br /><br />  N.Ploeger..Reader"
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"This movie has George Lucas' hands all over it. Now 20 years ago that might of been a good thing. But since the Phantom Menace, he must think the general movie going audience's are retards. I was insulted to no end watching this movie, sure it had some fun moments, but fun moments do not a good movie make. The whole thing was predictable, and the parts that were not were just terrible. I still love Harrison Ford and I still love the first 3 films, but there's something that happens to a artist when they're not hungry anymore. They lose that passion that made their early stuff so fun. Spielberg and Lucas are not hungry anymore and this film is another example. I will always cherish their early work. There is no soul here, just a bunch of people who know that if you put ""Indiana Jones"" in the title it's gonna make a lot of cold cash."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I thought I would address the question that bothered me most, is it worth rebuying Cars in Blu-ray?  I ran my dvd version, side by side with my Blu-ray, alternating scene by scene, on a Visio HD 1080p 42 inch monitor.  I even upscaled the dvd to 1080p on a fine upscaling Phillips dvd player.  The whole family commented on the difference.  The complete picture was just sharper with much more detail visible.  For example, in the racing scenes you could actually make out the cars in the seats in the speedway!  The desert landscape detail was just fantastic all the way out to the horizon.  I was sceptical.  I had resisted buying any animation on Blu-ray, but I thought I would give one a try.  As far as Cars is concerned, anyway, I was pleasantly surprised.  I am not sure Blu-ray is worth the list price, but if you can get it at a substantial discount (like at Amazon), I would say you won't be disappointed.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	Just started this program a few weeks ago and have started to see some improvement, not much weight loss yet though, but I have not followed the meal plan 100%.  I am anxious to get through the 60 days!
B0006989TE	2.0	b	Clearly Shyamalan was going for a movie more &quot;Signs&quot; than Signs itself was: upping the rural factor, putting the adept Joaquin Phoenix in a bigger role, and changing the aliens (I'm not making this up) to hooded porcupine walruses.<br /><br /> Missing, however, is the originality, humor, and suspense of &quot;Signs,&quot; or &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (I haven't seen &quot;Unbreakable&quot;). Instead we've got an overbearingly preachy preacher/teacher (William Hurt) and just a generally goofy story. Even Shyamalan's trademark cameo is annoying; we see the back of his head and a faint reflection on a refrigerator (ooh, who is it?)<br /><br /> I saw this one pretty late at night; I was falling asleep in the first half hour, but did my best to stay up, thinking it would pick up. Nope.<br /><br /> Two stars for James Newton Howard's often beautiful score and the refreshing romance between the quietly powerful Phoenix and the lovely Bryce Dallas Howard.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"Just like other other people have stated in their reviews, you should watch this movie based on the the performance of Charlize Theron alone.  She was amazing as Ravenna, the evil queen.  I was more emotionally invested in her character than anyone else's in the movie.  At the end of the film I was actually hoping that she would triumph over Snow White (the beat down she laid on Kristen Stewart was awesome)!  Watching the dynamics between her and her brother (an excellent performance by Sam Spruell)was worth the price of the rental. I do wish they would have spent more time developing Chris Hemsworth's (the Huntsman) and Sam Claflin's (William) character's.  They did a great job of portraying the torment (Hemsworth for his wife and Claflin for abandoning the Princess), but there just wasn't enough there to evoke more than just passing sympathy. 4 stars for the movie and a purchase of the Blu-ray for my collection.<br /><br />P.S. On Stewart's performance: I will agree that her motivational moment was laughable.  She also didn't come across to me as innocent.  I could have been jaded by the whole infidelity thing and had that filter on while watching the movie, but her body language with the other cast members seemed more ""sultry"" than anything else."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Like any movie, some like it and some do not.  I thought it was the best comic book movie yet and I read a gazilion comics growing up in the 60's.  Man I wish my Mom had not chunked all the comics that would be worth thousands now.  Oh well this movie did not try to put all the artsie fartsie stuff like the first Hulk and the third and embarressing Spiderman did.  Downey was excellent and looks perfect in the part.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	An excellent documentary. Informative, sad at times, and very motivating. A must watch for anyone who believes change is possible through daily action.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I really enjoyed this movie, the acting was great and for a moment you forget they are actors and felt you are watching real lives. Di caprio and Nicholson performances were flawless, I don't like Matt Damon that much, because the only role that fits him is Bourne,he is so inexpressive that kinda get boring after a while.<br /><br />I would give the movie 5 starts but we watched in a group of 10 people, and only 4 of them were delighted, the rest was like 'Its OK'<br /><br />The HDDVD version is beautiful but there's ot much in the FX department to really tak advantage of the HD goodies.<br /><br />Its a worth buying Mafia film!!
B000S5KGH4	1.0	b	Jeff Dunham relies on stereotypes as a source for his humor. He might be a skilled ventriloquist but he is not funny. If you like carlos mencia or colin quinn you'd probably like this crap, but most of us laugh at xenophobes like archie bunker not with them. If you think this is funny, you are the joke.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Iron man, marvel comics, Robert Downy jr is great as superhero.<br />great movie lots of action. special effects were great.<br />story was great the action moved along you didn't get bored always action going on.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"Martin Scorsese finally won the Oscar the whole world felt he was owed in 2006 when he made this new age crime thriller.  I have never been a huge follower of Scorsese, but I must admit that in recent years I've come to appreciate some of his finer works and have come to see him for far more than just a `gangster' movie maker.  Scorsese actually has a slick resume filled with much more than `GoodFellas' and `Casino'.  While I don't think `The Departed' is his best work (neither is `GoodFellas' or `Casino' for that matter) I can say that I understand why he finally won that directing Oscar and can actually say that his win is justified, despite the fact that sympathy played heavily in his favor.<br /><br />Now, when I sat back to finally review this film I came to a major roadblock.  One of the most rewarding things about `The Departed' is that it is so unpredictable.  Its one biggest flaw (that sloppy ending) is also the films biggest selling point (totally mind blowing in the way it just sneaks up on you) and so reviewing the plot seemed almost pointless.<br /><br />I mean, what can I say without saying too much?<br /><br />Billy Costigan is a cop being placed undercover into crime boss Costello's mob.  Colin is one of Costello's men being placed undercover into the Boston police force.  Neither knows of the other's existence yet almost simultaneously become aware of the other and begin trying to sniff the other out.<br /><br />Along the way lots of people die.<br /><br />Instead of trying to analyze the plot (which I'm sure a lot of you who have yet to see this will thank me for in the long run) I'm going to tell you why this film is worth your time.  Martin Scorsese is a master of the lens and crafts a genuinely intriguing and breakneck paced thriller that never runs too long and never loses you.  Despite everything that gets thrown your way, the film is actually very easy to follow.  It also sports one of the best ensemble casts of that particular year (forget `Little Miss Sunshine').  Everyone involved is really at the top of their game.  Leonardo DiCaprio is stellar here, truly phenomenal, and delivers what may be his finest performance to date.  He is completely aware of what makes Billy so essential to the audience, creating a likable, understandable and identifiable character who is also exciting.  Matt Damon, an actor I am not always sold on, is flawless here.  He doesn't have the same energetic draw that DiCaprio has, but he manages to make his character just as engaging.  Jack Nicholson is `Jack', plain and simple, but who better to play `Jack' than Jack?  As far as the supporting players are concerned, you have wonderfully fleshed out performances from Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Alec Baldwin; not to mention the glorious Vera Farmiga.<br /><br />Everyone is great.<br /><br />So this brings me to the films drawback; the ending.  I'm not going to divulge anything vital, I promise, but I can't not write about why I can't stand behind this film all the way.  It's a great movie, don't get me wrong.  It's exciting and interesting and engaging, but it lacks something crucial as it draws to a close.  The film just kind of falls apart very quickly.  There was so much time spent really fleshing out the films core that little to no attention was spent on fleshing out the films finale.  It just kind of...ends.  The ending appears almost thrown together haphazardly, and then the obviousness of the final shot was cringe inducing (why oh why did you do that Scorsese).  Up until the last ten minutes or so I was actually thinking this Oscar win was deserved, but there was so much more that could have and should have been done with the ending.<br /><br />It's rather sad really.<br /><br />Anyways, I cannot fault the film too much.  It succeeds in doing so much, and like I said, even though the films ending can be rendered a `flaw' it is also a HUGE selling point (you'll never see this one coming) so in the wise words of Benicio Del Toro, ""take the good."""
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	Jeff Dunham has to be one of my favorite comedians. Peanut and Walter are my favorite. My whole family watches these over and over again.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I am a huge Harry Potter fan.  I own all the books and movies.  They are so great!  The effects in this film are great and it is such a fun story.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Snow White was my biggest and most pleasant surprise of the past summer.  Charlize Thereon was terrific as the evil queen and made the movie a memorable and worthwhile viewing at the theater and a must-own addition to a video collection. I've already watched it twice on video and am happy to own it.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Iron Man and Ray Stark are new to me. I am not a comic book or fantasy fan. However, I enjoyed this film tremendously. The plot though thin, rang true and the superhero is expected to do some real acting. Though his feats are amazing, it is the scenery, his soul and the people supporting him that make this film so good.<br /><br /> Robert Downey, Jr plays Ray Stark, he owns a company that makes and sells high tech weaponry. At the moment he is in Afghanistan showing off his weaponry, when his group is attacked. He spends the next three months  building a suit to protect his new heart and himself. In the process he escapes and comes back to to life in California. Iron Man has a great cast of characters- Terrence Howard, as the military man, Gwyneth Paltrow as his girl Friday and Jeff Bridges as his accomplice in the company- Bridges really wears black. Needless  to say the plot thickens and Iron Man goes on to build a new suit to defend his newly found ethical behavior and save the day.<br /><br />Save the day, he does- Robert Downy Jr is a first rate actor with emotional liability and he is the Iron Man. The other actors are also first rate and this is the film of the past year, IMO.<br /><br />There is a shocking revelation and the hardware is impressive. This is a fun film for all.  The computer aided visuals are impressive and Iron Man, well he has Soul!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-02-09<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DE29SS"">Chaplin (15th Anniversary Edition)</a>"
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	I tried to do this dvd set for about 3 wks.,while it is a good work out some moves r 2 fast & it is definetly not for any one with bad knees like myself! There's a lot of jumping moves that my knees could'nt take. Otherwise it's a great cardio workout, wish i could do it.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	I'd read all the reviews and hype but was pleasantly surprised and pleased that the movie surpassed all my expectations. Micky Rourke was amazing and while I'll watch anything with Bruce Willis, he too was exceptional.
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	Poorly written, and the alien thing at the end made it worse. A robot officer that goes out of his way to support an agenda, by his creator. Give me a break! I knew what was going to happen before it actually did. Sorry writing. Sorry that I wasted money to watch it. Though I didnt order it thru Amazon. Because it only streams in 2 channel audio. If were to have ordered it thru Amazon there would be even more bad reviews for it. Dont waste your time folks....
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This is one of the best movies I have ever viewed.  The story the cars spin make good life long advice for anyone.  My 19 month old also likes the movie.
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	"How is it that an American film director, who's wins a ""Best Director"" Oscar for a film that he Plagarized from a Hong Kong film get so much credit as being ""Great"" and a ""Master"" ????  I'm sure that when he won the Oscar, he wanted to make it sound like this film was an original piece of work.  He didn't even mention that he COPIED THE ENTIRE IDEA from ""Infernal Affairs"" during his acceptance speech.<br /><br />I guess that American critics would call this as a ""remake"", but the entire idea of the movie was from Hong Kong.  However, if a foreign film company were to copy an American film idea, there would be law suits that the foreign company has plagarized an American idea.  Where's the justice?  What ever happened to the rights of others?  Is there some kind of double standard?"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"This movie is great for boys and girls alike. My two year old was enamored and actually had a CARS party for her third birthday. She became obsessed with collecting each of the CARS. She was also the only girl in her daycare with lightup Lightening McQueen shoes (yes, boys shoes - they make NO girl CARS stuff). The movie is cute and the G rating is appropriate. There is only one scary scene where Mater and Lightening go ""tractor tipping"" and a large tractor named ""Frank"" chases them through the field. The story is simple enough for young children to understand the plot, but interesting enough for the parents that will no doubt have to sit through it countless times."
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	Just saw the movie.  Loved it.  Very close to the book and am looking forward to the DVD release to add to my collection.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	One of my all-time favorite movies. Well written, exciting, action-packed with great acting. This movie has it all! The ending was god-awful. You're all revved up for this climatic finale and it all ends with a sorry-ass whimper.  If it wasn't blu-ray, I would have most likely passed on it. But this movie is a definite winner.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"Harry Potter leads a rebellion inside Hogwarts as the dark Lord Voldemort begins recruiting an army. All is not well at Hogwarts as Dumbledoor is undermined by a Ministry of Magic psychopath and evtnually replaced as Headmaster. No one believes Harry that the dark lord is back so he must lead a rebellion in secret called ""The Order of the Pheonix"".  More and more does it become clear that Harry and Lord Voldemort are connected. With the help of his godfather, Professor Snape, and other Order of the Pheonix members, Harry must fight back and vindicate both himself and Dumbledoor. New characters, like Luna Lovegood, bring an air of comic relief in a darker story than before."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I bought this workout DVD over a year ago. My husband an I had gained extra pounds after I had our first child, and wated to get back into shape. We started doing the work out, and I thought I was going to die every time. It was way more than what I expected, but after the first week my energy level was improving and I was in a better mood everyday unfortunately we only made it threw the first month. Our work schedules changed and we gave up. Now a year later we are starting it again and I couldn't be more happy and excited. This program is tough and you will start to have a love/hate realashonship with Shaun T.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Ridley Scott's return to the Sci-Fi genre has produced a beautiful and thought provoking film. I found Prometheus to be one of the summers best and one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have seen. The cast delivers superb performances especially in the cases of Fassabender and Rapace. Scott has delivered stunning visuals, and has created a believable universe that is rich in mythology. I would warn viewers to not expect an Alien movie. This film while a prequel is it's own self contained story and only subtle hints at the events of Alien. I believe many were expecting a straight forward prequel and the lack of connections to Alien is one of the primary reasons for all the negative reviews of the film. To be fair, while the film is a great movie, it is not perfect. The film suffers from obvious cuts to the story and these are most prevalent during the film's third act. I am hopeful that the extended cut that will be released on DVD  will help to answer many of the films unanswered questions. Despite the film's flaws Scott delivers a stunning and dark world that fits comfortably in with the Alien Saga. I hope Scott returns to do the promised sequel.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	There is nothing negative I can say about this movie. It was great, and the fact that Blu-Ray is so clear....it's amazing. I highly reccomend getting this movie on blu-ray.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	A well written story and the picture quality was amazing in 1080p format. Only disappointment was that this particular Blu-ray title does not come with a high definition sound track. It only has the core Dolby Digital soundtrack, which still sounds excellent.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I loved this movie so so so much. I have invited my in-laws and my mother over to see it and they loved it. It has such a great message and a joy to watch, Thank you Disney!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	That is one of the better lines Peanut has.  All of them are hilarious & the best part is in the bloopers.....its Peanut & that's all I'm gonna say about that, go watch it, totally hilarious!
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Very different twist to what I am use to. Captivating plot and story that keeps your attention. Gloom and despair is overcome by good.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	If there was 6 or more stars I would rate it all of it :)!!! This show is great to watch!!! It keeps you on the edge of your seat! I love it and I can't wait for the third season to come out!!!!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I was really pleased with the service I received when I ordered this DVD.  It came in a very timely manner and was in excellent shape!  I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Was better in the theater - but this is awesome!  i had my doubts about Robt Downey Jr as a 'superhero', but he was PERFECT! Beginning grabs your attention and remains very interesting!  Cant wait for the sequel!
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	It's amazing how utterly disappointing this was. I nearly walked out of the theater. If you liked this movie, you have no taste in film, and your standards are extremely low to be entertained. Lucas and Spielberg should bow their heads in shame for this POS.<br /><br />PS If you think bad CGI gophers are entertaining and belong in an Indiana Jones movie, then you'll love it.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	This is a great Harry Potter film too bad its marred by the terrible transfer. Im not sure how Amazon can allow such a crappy product to leave their warehouse but obviously they have. The movie itself is still worth watching bad transfer or not. Its dark and pixelated in some areas but after a few minutes you get used to it and are able to block it out of your vision. Amazon is doing a diservice to HP but it cannot kill the fact its a great movie. Thats the reason i did not give it 5 stars..
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"This is a wonderful movie - something every couple, whether married or not, should watch this film.  There are some beautiful lessons here that we all can learn from.  This is a ""5+"" film."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"This is my son's favorite movie.  We watch it nightly...I'm not kidding.  All I hear all day is ""Momma...cars.  Cars.  Cars, momma"".  Good thing it's funny & entertaining otherwise I'd be sick of it already!  I keep the blu-ray version downstairs & the dvd copy upstairs.  Can't wait to get Cars 2!"
B000S5KGH4	3.0	b	"I first saw this guy in the early '90s on A&E, and he was doing a lot of this same material; the ""on a stick"" schtick has been used in his act for at least 15 years. I found him quite amusing, and I still do, but with at least one caveat: he tries too hard these days to inject his political axe-grinding into the act. Rather like Drew Carey and the creators of South Park -- two other right-wing comedians who are actually funny when they stick to comedy -- he apparently thinks he's accumulated enough of a following that he should now use his clout to promote the cause. (See the dead terrorist skit and the Prius/Hummer one.) They really aren't funny and are pretty ineffective; those who praise those two skits can't be doing so on comedic merits, because those skits have almost none. It's a pity, really, because when Dunham sticks to comedy, he's really pretty talented (see the opening monologue about the puppet and the airport screeners, as well as the ones about Bubba and his wife -- ""Where'd you meet her? At the family reunion"" -- as well as almost everything on here (Walter and the ""menstrual cycle"" is very amusing) except the pimp bit, which was rather forced. Dude... you're a comedian. Stick to that and let Rush Limbaugh be the talentless political blowhard."
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	This movie certainly has an allstar cast but I think the movie itself was too complicated. You have story segments here and there so if you watch this movie while doing something it is difficult to follow. I'm also not really a big fan of black and white movies because it doesn't draw my attention too well so I didn't really like this movie.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Product in excellent shape and was shipped faster than I had expected.  Great service!
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"(...)<br /><br />The problem with most thrillers is that once you've watched them one time, there is nothing left. Too many of these films spend all of their creative energy trying to give the audience a scare. The best directors of the genre create truly great films, which just happened to give the audience a scare. While M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent craftsman, he tends to be unable to elevate his films into the realms of true cinema. The Village is no exception.<br /><br />The story centers around a small village that seems to be set in the later part of the 1800's. The Villagers have worked out a complicated deal with strange creatures (""Those We Do Not Speak Of"") lurking in the near woods. Problems arise and the long held pact begins to break down. This causes there to be a need for one of the villagers to venture through the woods into the larger towns.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the Village and the last several of Shyamalan's films is his surprise endings. I read somewhere several years ago that he didn't want to be pigeonholed into doing the same supernatural type stories with twist ending. I wish he had kept to his word. Instead everyone goes into the theatre expecting, waiting on the surprise at the end. This is a distraction taken away from the whole of the film; it is a gimmick that has run thin. A truly surprising ending for the director now, would be no surprise at all.<br /><br />Where Shyamalan excels is his Hitchcockian use of suspense. He understands that some of the best thrills come not from something jumping straight out at the audience, but in what we don't see. It is a long time in the Village before we see ""The Things We Don't Speak Of"" and even then we only catch a glimpse. For Shyamalan understands that our imaginations are more powerful than any piece of costuming or CG effect. There were, in fact, several moments during my first viewing of the film that hand my hair standing on end. These were tense, beautifully paced moments.<br /><br />The film also creates a masterful sense of mood. The color scheme, set design and costuming are all top notch. They give the film a true sense of paranoia and suspense. The acting, for the most part, is quite good. Which is not surprising considering the cast is made up of the likes of William Hurt, Sigorney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrian Brody amongst others. There several interweaving human stories set amongst the supernatural tale, some of which are quite moving. Yet it is the supernatural aspect that shines brightest, and ultimately, falls flat upon subsequent viewings. Watching the film a second time, knowing the surprises, I felt a tinge of boredom. The story no longer captivated me as it did the first time. Knowing the truth, there were too many plot points, and character actions that seemed false, or self serving.<br /><br />It is a film worth a first viewing. Shyalaman is a true talent, and I look forward to his next film. In a sense the Village is really two stories. One is a suspenseful tale of creatures lurking in the dark, and the other of a quaint village dealing with extraordinary circumstances. I believe the fault lies with the merging of the two. The suspense doesn't hold up under subsequent viewings. It does not serve the other aspect of its story. Likewise, the more human story is broken apart too much by the mystical aspects<br /><br />(...)"
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"Little kids seem to like hearing the same stories, over and over, until the adult reading the stories is bored numb. Adults aren't all that different, though. A good story, like Snow White, gets told again and again. When the story is so familiar, the unique character of each retelling really comes through. In this case, the best features are the effects and Charlize Theron's wicked stepmother.<br /><br />The effects are everything you could hope, given current movie-making technology, and really have to be seen. Theron does an outstanding job as the evil queen, though - she convincingly projects psychpathic malice, despite her physical beauty and with no redeeming hint of human warmth. Perhaps it's no surprise that <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LAIHY0"">Prometheus</a> was in theaters about the same time as Snow White, and Theron played a similar character: never a hair out of place, but inhuman in dedication to her goals. Really, she made the movie. Except for the fact that Snow White got promoted from wimpy maiden in need of saving, the other roles didn't rise to that level.<br /><br />Fun popcorn flick, beautifully put together, but (excpet for Theron), forgettable.<br /><br />-- wiredweird"
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Frank Miller does not like women.  I'm firmly convinced of this, as every woman here (and most if not all in his comic book epic this is based on) is either a stipper, prostitute, or college professor.<br /><br />And the college professor died before the movie starts.<br /><br />Despite this, there are no real weak female roles.  While they all have less than respectable professions, they are all strong, unique characters, and I think that pretty much lets Frank off the hook.<br /><br />In a more general sense, this movie is about a film noir kind of town.  Guns are everywhere, blood and death abound.  Howeveer, the visual style of it all is so compelling that it looks remarkably similar to the comic opus.  Strong uses of black and white keep everything graphic, but not gory.<br /><br />The movie is actually about 3 character's tales, that intertwine on a very superficial level.  You can tell they all inhabit the same city, but rarely get in each other's way.  That said, this film is a work of art, in that it is visually compelling and wonderfully written.  It is gritty and violent, but there is a beauty to it all.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	Night has yet to top this flick.  He speaks to the notions of the human condition and fidelity and wraps the entire thing in some sort of allegorical reference to Dubya and Nine Eleven.  A brilliant film, really.  Unfortunately one or two twists too many ultimately prevent it from being considered an all-time great.  The story, the acting, the script, and the cinematography were all there.  Too bad the lack of excessive twists couldn't also be there.
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	Iron Man accomplishes what I heretofore thought was impossible: it makes the first act of the hero's origin story (before he attains his powers) the most enjoyable part of a comic book movie.<br /><br />Tony Stark is a guiltless hedonist living the ultimate playboy lifestyle with narcissistic charm and dexterity. As a rich weapons manufacturer, he indulges in high technology, gleefully treats objects like women (a Big Lebowski reference for you Jeff Bridges fans) and flies in a private jet packed with strippers and booze.<br /><br />As 'Back In Black' blares on a stereo system, he boasts of his company's latest devastating firepower available for sale to the U.S. military. It is at this time that a group of Afghani terrorists obliterate his convoy and take the fatally wounded Stark hostage. It seems he is needed to build a missile for them; the twist being that it is a weapon he himself designed.<br /><br />The only way his heart can be kept beating is by keeping it connected to a crude battery unit. In a terrifically suspenseful sequence, Stark stalls for time so he can build an iron suit capable of protecting him from bullets and explosions while he wipes out his captors.<br /><br />Upon returning to L.A. (in an unlikely rescue), Stark decides to stop developing weapons and live a nobler lifestyle (which is no fun). However, Jeff Bridges (the requisite confidant-turned-archenemy) has other ideas and battles against Stark's newfound idealism while secretly creating his own goliath suit; presumably because all bad guys in these movies crave Ultimate Power.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is the producers' ace-in-the-hole. Without him this would be just another mediocre entry in the long line of cookie-cutter Marvel films. His performance hits you like a shot of pure oxygen. He is the slick, supercool badass with snappy one-liners we all wish we could be. Even when the plot falls apart, Downey's mere presence makes the onscreen nonsense bearable (and, at times, hardly noticeable).<br /><br />The rest of the bland cast isn't worth mentioning. After Stark constructs his true Iron Man suit and the obvious reveal of Jeff Bridges as the villain, there's nowhere left to go except the inevitable showdown. Or so the screenwriters have surmised. The remainder of Iron Man's running time is a tedious, disappointing affair.<br /><br />My personal preference would have been for Stark to simply fight terrorism across the globe without the stale conflict of Jeff Bridges' character (especially because Bridges' dialogue eventually becomes cartoonishly rotten, even for this type of movie). There's a scene where this happens and it's the last time Iron Man provides a refreshing antidote to the typical mundane style of storytelling prevalent in Marvel's blockbuster features.<br /><br />At least the audience can rightfully expect a better sequel from the brave, abrupt surprise ending.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff is GREAT. I have both of his DVDs. Peanut has been one of my favorites for quite some time. Jeff is always coming out with new material and new characters.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	It's hard to add to what's already been said about this marvelous mini-series.  The acting is superb - Giamatti, Linney and Wilkinson all deserve their kudos and awards.  However, I was particularly impressed by Zeljko Ivanek's portrayal of John Dickinson, as well as Danny Huston's take on Samuel Adams.  The only disappointment, in my view, was the portrayal of George Washington (although David Morse IS a fine actor).  Yes, in real life, GW may have been a reluctant warrior weighed down by responsibility, but I doubt he looked as constipated as he does here, constrained by a too-tight costume and an overbearing schnozz.<br /><br />The direction and photography deserve special credit.  They eschew the sterility and stodginess often found in period pieces and give the scenes a sense of immediacy --- fully warranted by the time of upheaval being portrayed.  The unusual camerawork may feel queasy at times, but it's perfect for conveying the uncertainty and doubt faced by these revolutionaries.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Pixar is amazing. There is no way of picking a favorite from pixar. Every movie they make is so original, funny and heartfelt. The really put their hearts into every movie they make.<br /><br />This movie is about a car who is selfish and through a life changing expericence with a small town, who changes into a good car.<br /><br />Great detail to everything in this film, down to every little tire mark on the roads and to the trip to california when you see different landmarks in different states.<br /><br />Nicole M*
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	I grabbed this movie for a great deal.  My husband is a big Harry Potter movie fan and was happy to add this to his collection for less than five bucks.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	JEFF DUNHAM IS AWESOME AND THIS IS SUCH A FUNNY TAPE. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO LAUGH.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Javier Bardem should be arrested for stealing this movie! NO ONE could have done a better job. He OWNS this picture!
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	This movie was simply too boring and stuoid to keep watching.  It's basically a darker version of Dick Tracey.<br /><br />Skip this one unless you like the comic books.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	First off for the comment saying about the little kids didn't use good judgement when they got on the train.... oh jeez it's a MOVIE, I think this is a great movie and everyone should have a copy. People do not use good judgment when they write comments like that. Everyones a critic these days, and they bitch and complain way too much. God get a LIFE!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This was a great movie and the cars that came with it was just the cherry on the top
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"I can't even tell you what a disappointment this movie was.  So many others have pointed out the HUGE plot holes, inconsistencies and continuity problems that they've saved me a lot of time and writing.  I will say that the film is gorgeous to look at.  Much of that has to do with the use of good, old fashioned practical effects...like miniatures used for the Star Wars films and huge sets built to human scale.  It makes very little use of CGI.  Because you're looking at REAL sets with REAL creatures, you always feel like these elements are actually in the scene with the actors because...the ARE, and it adds realism that most movies that depend on CGI today lack.<br /><br />That's the best thing about this movie.  Don't expect a cohesive story at all.  I knew the problems were going to be big when the space explorers land on a planet they've NEVER been to  and enter an alien structure they know NOTHING about only for one, supposedly educated ""scientist"" to say, ""Hey, my electronic analyzer said the air is breathable out here."" SO HE TAKES HIS HELMET OFF!  Unbelievable. About 2 hours and 100 WTF's later, the main character (minor spoiler) givers herself an automated C-section, then...PROCEEDS TO RUN AROUND LIKE RAMBO KICKING ALIEN ASS LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.  In the real world, she wouldn't be able to stand up straight let alone sprint around and kill aliens.<br /><br />When I heard that the writer from TV's LOST wrote this script, the condition of the movie made sense.  I tried to watch that series when it originally aired but found the pacing glacial at best.  It would take an entire 45 minutes of programming (minus commercials) to reveal one teeny tiny bit of information that may or may NOT be relevant to the barely-there plot...but you'll have to tune in next week folks to find out if that's so.  Ugh.  This movie FELT like it was written by a TV guy who wrote a LONG-winded series that disappointed most of its viewers after four years of loyalty for NO payoff and a WTF tacked on ending with tons of loose ends.  That's the feeling Prometheus gives you.  It's a shame so many writers now lack real STORY CRAFT and instead have to hide that deficit behind ""cool"" complicated and confusing ""plots"" so you don't realize there isn't a real story there behind all the razzle dazzle effects."
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	I must say that I was disappointed in the movie. I saw it at Cinemark XD-RealD 3D, which I believe may be like IMAX 3D. The 3D was super, and I enjoyed the visuals. I felt that the acting was more than adequate.<br />  However the plot was a complete mess, from beginning to end. I could not understand the beginning of the movie, the middle, and the end. It is hard to be detailed because I am trying to avoid spoilers. I could not understand the motivation of the characters and the story was not easy to follow. I was shocked that the plot was so poorly written.<br />  I love science fiction, the Aliens franchise, and Ridley Scott. Believe me that I was looking for reasons to like the movie. I would rate this movie a C-, which I define as viewable but would not be motivated to buy the Blu-ray. The movie felt like it was motivated from the Aliens franchise but did not really add anything to that universe. It also was not drawing on enough of the Aliens movies. It was worth seeing in the theater, but not more than this. The Amazon rating of 3.5/5 is probably fair.
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	Love the movie , but something with the DVD happens, between 55-65 minutes the movie statrts to skip and stop. This happen with 2 different Iron Man DVD's. Amazon was great with there return policy. Maybe I just had bad luck.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I loved this movie! Dolores Umbridge is a love to hate character. I enjoyed the Room of Requirement and Dumbledore's Army. By far, the best movie in the series IMO. Enjoy!
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	I had only watched the first Indiana Jones film before watching this one, but I don't need to watch the other two originals to know that they're much better than this. The plot is really ridiculous and full of big holes, like how they let the traitor keep following them around and a zillion more that you don't have to keep an eye out for to notice. Most of the acting is ok except for Harrison Ford who is still hilarious and very entertaining even though the rest of the movie elements fail to complete the package. The story mainly ruined it, I mean a plot centered around aliens really didn't fit the series. It was way too far-fetched and loses your interest pretty fast. The visual effects are pretty much up to par and are really well done. The music is, of course, spot-on as John Williams is the composer. So overall I recommend you do NOT watch this movie. Even if you rent it for $1 at your local Safeway it's a wasted dollar and also a wasted two hours unless you just want to be entertained a bit by Harrison Ford.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	I was looking forward to seeing this movie. My mom and I went and saw it in the theatre, unsure of what to think of it. About the first 45 minutes were awesome; very beautifully filmed, with good action and decent acting. Once Snow White and the Huntsman had been traveling together for about ten minutes, however, my mind started to throb with agonizing boredom. The story moved incredibly slow, with bad acting--loved Hemsworth as THOR, & he was good in this role, though the script fairly SUCKED, and Stewart is the most horrible actress I've ever seen, being the top-paid one in Hollywood for one (ugly) expression--though Theron was good, even if most of her monologues turned into meaningless rambling.<br /><br />When are we ever going to get a STRONG HEROINE???? (Buffy, please come back!!!) Snow White spends most of the movie running around w/ the Huntsman through the woods, and getting scared at trees and vines. When we meet the dwarves (some of the most entertaining characters in the movie) we keep getting told that Snow White is special, and the one to end the war, yaddy-yaddy-yadda. The aforementioned war took forever to get around to actually happening. In between, there was a TERRIBLE attempt at romance--bad love triangles follow Stewart around everywhere--and it was never even solved, even if the Huntsman's kiss brought Snow back to life after eating the apple. Once we got to the war, Snow White dressed in armor and carried a sword--since when did she learn how to wield one?--and runs into the castle while all the men fight behind her & tries to kill the Queen. When she finally does, she tells her blandly that she can't have her heart (apparently the Queen needed it to keep herself young & beautiful... Not that Snow is prettier than her, something I think just about EVERYONE noticed)... and then she sits down and starts CRYING. She seems to feel SORRY for the Queen. The woman who would have killed her without a second thought, stole her childhood & stuffed her up in a tower for most of her life... Snow CRIES over her. And, being the bad actress that she is, Kristen Stewart didn't even cry believably.<br /><br />However, I can't be ALL mean. Most of the time, the filming was beautiful, and the action scenes were reasonably good, if pointless. The glass soldiers were cool.<br /><br />I don't want to be mean to the actors either. Kristen Stewart could probably do well in SOMETHING, if only she'd be in a movie with a good script, and start to be more expressive.<br /><br />I usually don't like to be this critical. But this movie was sooooooooooooooo slow-moving and mind-numbingly boring... And it could've been so much better.
B005ZMUQCK	1.0	b	I have a huge problem with this movie.  As was brought to my attention by a fellow Ammy buddy, I do tend to be extra harsh to films that seem to get `undeserved' praise and attention.  I feel at times like I need to knock them down a peg.  I think that, for the most part, the world agrees that `Cars' is one of Pixar's weakest films.  They may not loathe it as I do, but I don't think anyone is going to try and make a case for `Cars' being a better film than `Up' or `Finding Nemo'.  What I find upsetting is that people actually like this film at all.<br /><br />It's not funny, it's not witty, it's not charming, it's not fresh, it's not exciting, it's not really much of anything other than a complete waste of time.<br /><br />UGH, I hate this movie.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a selfish hotshot race car who gets lost on his way to an important race and winds up doing some heavy damage to a road in Radiator Springs.  He can't leave until he helps fix what he's done, and in the process his eyes are opened and his life is changed (or at least his `outlook' on that life).  He meets an array of shiny (and rusty) new friends (well, not at first) who teach him some valuable life lessons.<br /><br />The film is shiny, but at the same time it is rather one-note.  The voice acting is effective, not nothing truly noteworthy.  The plot is simple and rather `cookie cutter', and that isn't helped by the lackluster script that layers that characters with clich&eacute; dialog and gags that are almost mind-numbing in their inability to illicit a genuine response from the audience (and by audience I mean ME since I am the only audience that matters in my personal opinion of this film).<br /><br />In a word, this film is just `boring'.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This Documentary is a must see for anyone that is interested in what they eat and are trying to be heathy. It is also very well made and keeps your attention.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"Ok, I'm going to be as brutally honest as possible.  I bought Insanity 3 plus yrs ago, when I was overweight with high bp, lazy and smoked cigarettes.  Prior to that, in my 20's and earlier (soon to be 40 next month), I was very active (gym,dancing, bike riding, etc), healthy, normal blood pressure and non-smoker.  As I got older, I remembered what the younger me looked like, how I felt and what I did.  I wanted to capture my youth again and get back on the health kick. So I decided to purchase Insanity because it looked like something I would have and could have done years ago.  I decided to lose weight and get healthy.  I sat down and watched it straight through.  I even had my track athlete teenage son watch it with me.  I begged him to start it with me just for company.  Ok, this is how it went:<br /><br />First time, we did the fit test and I sat down half way through it and he did the whole thing.  After I realized I was still alive, I put it back in the box and in the corner.<br /><br />Second time, six months later, my son decided he can't train with his team and train with me (his out of shape mom) because he would be overtraining.  So he decided to write my reps down for me, as I can't write and breathe at the same time.  During the fit test, I realized that my fat butt can't drop to the floor and stand up immediately after. I'm more like a ""roll on the floor while making loud ""Awwww"" noises"" type of gal.  When it came to the high jumps, it didn't feel like my legs.  I felt like I was picking up two huge logs. So, when I couldn't complete the fit test without seeing the grim reaper sitting on the couch waiting for me, I put it back in the box and in the corner again.<br /><br />Third time, 1 yr later, I decided to do the fit test for seven days and then move on to the 60 day program. Well, so much for that plan.  I did do a few more reps than the prior two times and I was able to stay alive a little longer than before, but the grim reaper said ""Hey, Smokie, why r u killing yourself with Insanity? Come and talk to me.""  My response was ""Ok, can you put it back in the corner for me while I go find a lighter.""<br /><br />Present, 8 months later, I've been told I'm obese with high bp. The doctor told me I have to lose weight. He looked at me as he has so many times before (the why are you wasting my time, lady, look). He said, so what now? My response was, ""What do you mean what now?  I didn't quit smoking for nothing.  I'm about to go INSANE!!!!""<br /><br />So that's where I'm at now. I'm going to start Day 1 tomorrow as a non-smoker, more motivated, not quitting and determined to walk into my doctor's office 6 weeks from now singing Chris Brown's song ""LOOK AT ME NOW!"" I know that I'm going to have to ""LOSE MY MIND UP IN HERE"" to achieve my goal.  So Insanity here I come.<br /><br />I'll write updates to let you know how it's going.  ;-)"
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	The 5th movie in the Harry Potter series is again a great installment in this movie franchise.  As usual, the mood is darker than the previous movie, though we do have some true romance in this one.  The cast is big, as we have numerous characters from all the previous movies, with several new ones, both students and professors.  Alas this is the first movie without any Quidditch scenes, though this is more than compensated by some awesome broomstick flying thru downtown London.  And we finally have some extensive duels to the death between adult wizards and witches, with two of them forming the movie's climax.  Overall, a great movie.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	Merchandise arrived in good condition.<br />Movie was typical Indiana Jones, very enjoyable.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	i absolutely love this program!!! i started with p90x (love that too), but was getting a little bored and wanted something with more cardio. i hit the jackpot with insanity. i've only had it a couple days and i'm in love. my first day was a little rough b/c the warm up takes you from 0 to 60 in no time flat and being a person who deals with asthma that's a bit much. i fixed that problem by doing my own little warm up to get my lungs ready and heart rate up before i start insanity. that one change worked like a charm and yesterday's workout was smooth sailing. i'm excited again about my workouts!!!
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"Terrific movie. Have an early Sony Blu-Ray player, and this movie will not play on it. The need to ""update"" the software on Blu-Ray players is maddening!"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"This guy and all his ""friends"" are just as funny as can be, and worth watching over and over again.  He's such a good ventriloquist that you actually forget he's talking for his friends, and his range of voices and accents is amazing.  His own persona appears so sweet and upbeat, while his characters all seem to have ""issues.""  It's a genuine hoot, and I highly recommend it!"
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	"This is a ""grown-up"" version of the Snow White fairy tale we have all heard many times before.  Dark and gritty, the queen exhibits pure evil, though you develop a little sympathy for her by the end (just as Snow White does).  The costumes and effects are great, and Hemsworth once again proves he is an action star to watch.  This isn't your children's fable, but definitely one older teens and adults can get into, particularly if you enjoy films of action and the fantasy/sci-fi genre."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I love Jeff saw him in person at the Improv in Arizona he was awesome!! Loved the dvd and wish he had more.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	Great first half of movie 7.  Glad they did not leave any of the book out of the Movie<br />Harry Potter ROCKS!!!
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	As is usual with a Pixar film, Cars has excellent visuals, and they really shine in the Blu-Ray version of the film.  The movie is sure to be a hit with the kids, but falls short in one area that other Pixar films have excelled -- appeal to adults.  I viewed this one once, and will probably leave it on the shelf for the sake of completeness, but I can't see watching it again, like I have with Monsters, Inc., or the exceptional WALL-E.  If you're looking for something to entertain the kids, save some money and get it on DVD instead of Blu-Ray.  If you're looking to build a complete collection of Pixar on Blu-Ray, it's worth the money.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	saw the movie and it was really good some twist and turns as usual but really good.,
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Really funny, and incredible at what he does.  You will laugh so hard. Worth buying, especially at the great price.  Get both!
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	Waste of time and money. It sucked from the first minute to 15 minutes later. I could not watch more.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is absolutely hilarious.  Did see the show on Comedy Central (edited version) but enjoyed the unedited much more enjoyable without the bleeps.  Jeff Dunham is a master and his characters, especially Walter and Peanut, are phenomenally funny!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I saw this before by my husband hadn't and we both love it!  It has great morals and a fun story line.  And anything about Nascar is always good!
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I have all the Harry Potter movie's and i think they get better every time the Order of the Phoenix is one of the best seen i got it i think i have watch it 30 time if you want a good movie with lot's of action get this one.
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	That acid-trip dance scene inside the tent was the most awkward and worthless 5 minutes of cinema ever created.  The rest of the movie was tolerable, but not as entertaining as previous movies of this series.  Disappointed.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	With the price of Blue Ray discs so high I have found myself renting more than buying but there are a few titles out there whose rental convinces me that they are worth spending a little extra. Ironman is an excellent example of the power of blue ray, an extremely polished film and one that looks absolutely stunning on Blue Ray.<br /><br />As a movie I have found myself rewatching the first hour more than the second. As with any comic book origin story you learn where the hero comes from, what pushes him to risking his life for others, and a little about where he is going. The interesting thing with this film is that it is far stronger in its early stages when we are learning these facets of our hero than it is after the hero has been constructed (literally in this case). It almost feels as though once the premise is all in place the writers were not really sure what to do with him so they fabricated a quick enemy for him to fight. As an origin story though it is very engaging.<br /><br />So after we have discovered the why and the who behind our superhero there needs to be a super villain standing in opposition and this is where I think the movie falters a little. I got a trifle bored in the last quarter of the movie once the villain of the piece has been revealed. I almost wish they had have ended the story after the origin part was over and spent more time in a sequal on setting up a major villain.<br /><br />Here is hoping that ironman 2 gives us a more convincing nemesis.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	So after a thousand script rejects we finally had a fourth Indy movie, it is a good movie but it could of been better.<br /><br />When Looking forward to seeing Indiana Jones and The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull i was well excited but when i left my Multiplex Cinema here in the U.K. i was a little bit dissapointed, the first problem is that Harrison Ford is too Old and the Lead should of gone to someone else, the second problem is the return of Actress Karen Allen, she was brillant in The Raiders Of The Lost Ark but here she is just out of place and time.<br /><br />I also feel that the comic bits should of been left on Spielbergs editor cutting room floor as these films are meant to be all Action, i feel those bits of Marion and her son took away some of the action the core of the film.<br /><br />But anyway i was impressed with Cate Blancett and Ray Winstone's acting he always impresses me (English Actor- Hardman Big Respect) in most of his films so i was glad to hear he was chosen for the role, also i liked John Hurt's performance.<br /><br />So with the minor problems that the film has (in my opinion) it is a good, solid, entertaining Action Adventure which i enjoyed at the Cinema.<br /><br />About the DVD as i have the Pre-Order date for this DVD i will probably purchase it, the extras which i have seen on this 2 Disc Special Edition set look tasty so i will add it to my collection A.S.A.P.<br /><br />So overall i enjoyed Indiana Jones and The KIngdom Of The Crystal Skull, it has its problems like so many other Summer Blockbusters but this is a good fourth Indiana Jones for Steven Spielberg, i bet he is swimming in all the money.<br /><br />I give this film 3 stars.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	This is an excellent movie--lots of action, a complex plot with many twists, and stellar performances by top-rate actors.  Just be forewarned-- a LOT of people get killed, and always with a great spray of blood.  Great movie, well worth the time and money.  Unfortunately, it could have been much better if the violence had been dialed down a bit.  I usually don't get worked up about things like that, but it was a blight on an otherwise perfect movie.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	This is one bad a@@ fairy-tale! Charlize Theoren is excellent, and who couldn't watch Chris Hemsworth being fabulous for a few hours? The special effects are impressive in the veeeeeerrrry scary Dark Forest. Loved the end, won't give it away, but Ms. White is no simpering, helpless princess. Awesome!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I watched this movie with my family and I was saddened and horrified by the state of industrial farming.  I want to buy this movie for everyone I know!  We really do vote with our grocery store purchases and we can change things, but it takes watching a movie like this, doing your homework, and be willing to face what you have been putting in your body.  Not to mention the corrupt organizations that WE support by buying food that come from feed lots and industrial farms.  Watch this movie... ESPECIALLY if you have kids.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	this dvd was amazing  jeff dunham should definately do more for the public  i for one would buy them all  he is so funny its untrue  its a1
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	After watching this movie, I look forward to get myself the extended version.  For enthusiasts, they would have already known that Sin City is based upon comics done by Frank Miller and from excerpt provided in behind the scene, Frank himself didn't believe a movie need to be made as it's perfect as it is.  However, Robert Rodriquez had an idea that he couldn't resist.  Rather than conforming the comic to the movie format, he opts to turn it the other way around, made a movie that looked like a comic.  This movie is a testament of why I love movie at the first place.  It's an escapism, away from reality and for those two hours watching it, I literally was brought into the world of Sin City and totally captivated by all those characters (mainly strong men that had soft spots for fallen girls and who would be their protectors or their minders, to undo the wrongs or to make things right).  It's a movie that ought to be seen to be believed.  It's that good!  It would be one of those movies that would sit on well with Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill I and II.  Highly recommended.  This edition is thin on extras, only a behind the scene which is brief by any standard.  Get the extended one if you may.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"Like most mom's I am struggling with losing the last 15 lbs of pregnancy weight and have fought to lose this for the last 2 years (my youngest is turning 2 in a week).  I love swimming but couldn't fit it in my schedule with working full time and 2 active young kids. Tried P90X but had trouble following all the workouts and didn't really like Tony Horton's comedy embedded in the workout. Then I turned to my home gym (elliptical, bench, free weights, and stationary bike) but saw myself losing interest in creating my own routine(s) and was not seeing the results I wanted in those pregnancy areas (legs, butt and stomach - I should say that I have had 2 c-sections).<br /><br />I broke down and decided to try something new where I did not have to think about what routine to do as well as something that fit into my time crunched day.  The Insanity workouts have been great for me.  I am a week in and am following all the nutritional aspects in addition to working out.  I never thought I would say this nor would I believe it but I am ALREADY starting to see results.  I do have bad knees but have not had any problems as Shawn T is very good at telling you how to make sure your form is correct.  His directions are clear and concise.  He is also motivating and makes you want to push through it.<br /><br />One thing I would recommend is doing this on a surface that has some give. You will be doing a lot of jumping and lateral movements.  I initially started doing it on a concrete surface but have since purchased gym quality tiles from Amazon to create the space and comfort I need.<br /><br />I will update as I make it through the Insanity experience.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />All most done with the first month of the Insanity workout and I did not take a day off or deviate from the scheduled work out plan.  The results are astonishing to say the least.  My thighs are getting thinner and am losing the tummy weight from my last pregnancy and c-section.  I can actually see my upper abdominals and am getting the definition from my obliques. The best part is how strong my body feels.  Every workout is a new way to push myself to ""dig deeper"" and I feel like Shawn T is my own personal trainer - not some condesending trainer making jokes like Tony Horton.  I can't wait to do the recovery week and then move on to the Max workouts - honestly I am a little nervous about that.<br /><br />I workout at 5:00 in the morning and would recommend warming up for 10 minutes prior to doing the warm up in the dvd."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"In ""The Departed"" (2006) directed by Martin Scorcese, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is young police officer who has been sent undercover to work for a vicious and powerful Boston mafia boss, Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) was handpicked by Costello as a young boy and placed to the Police Academy with the intention to infiltrate later the Boston Police Department. One day, two young men will inevitably meet...<br /><br />""The Departed"" is a very good film but sadly, it slows down in the final 20 or so minutes and leaves a viewer (yours truly) with several questions and slightly disappointed. Seems that Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello kept all parts of the movie together and after his departure, it became literally empty. As for directing, Martin Scorsese is in the top his form -the movie is well paced, suspenseful, and has a great soundtrack (as usual in Scorsese movies). The cast is the closest to perfect it could be. As much as I like Jack Nicholson, it was nothing he has not done before (his Frank Costello is a combination of Daryl Van Horne and Col. Nathan R. Jessep) but Leonardo DiCaprio as Billy Costigan played the best role of his career. About a year ago, I wrote about his acting in Scorcese's previous movie, ""The Aviator"", ""Leonardo DiCaprio earns my respect and admiration for his acting - he is one of the most talented young actors now and I will be waiting for his following films impatiently. I trusted him in every scene and he made me feel strongly for and sympathize with Howard Hughes's affliction."" I am very glad to admit that in ""The Departed"" he is even better - the hell Billy Costigan has lived in working undercover for the devilishly evil Frank Costello was absolutely real, suffocating and palpable. DiCaprio had many scenes with Nicholson and he never got lost next to his celebrated partner.<br /><br />Not as perfect as ""Goodfellas"" which comes to mind while watching ""The Departed"", the newest Scorcese's work is a lot of fun to watch - it is an inspiring film-making, and I am happy that finally Scorsese has been recognized by the Academy for his directing."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Loved this movie when it first came out. Loved watching it over again at Christmas and even other times. Even more amazed now I can view it in 3D. This is a keeper, to be enjoyed annually, especially in the company of friends and family. The 2D version is great; the 3D version is even better.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"If you are looking for an OSCAR Award winning cast then this is not. What makes this movie 5-STARS is the message. I cried through half of it just thinking of how horrible it would be to lose that ""love & feeling"" and how a marriage can fall apart. Although I have a great marriage, I cried thinking about people I really care and their marrital problems. I truely believe this movie could help save marriages."
B0006989TE	5.0	b	I was appalled to see all of the negative reviews for &quot;The Village&quot;, especially the A.O. Scott review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, where he made possibly the stupidest journalistic remark I have read this year when he said that the colors in &quot;The Village&quot; had to do with terrorism alert warnings. How ignorant. You'd think he would at least PRETEND to have studied the significance of colors in Indian culture ... but I digress.<br /><br /> Have you ever heard of something called, &quot;A thinking person's movie&quot;? You know, movies like &quot;The Night of the Hunter&quot;, &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot;, and &quot;Spellbound&quot;? Hint hint: I'm not talking about movies such as &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, or &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; here (which are all good movies in their own way, but not THINKING movies).<br /><br /> M. Night Shyamalan's movies are for people who like to THINK while they are watching a movie, not just sit back and be mindlessly entertained. I guess that make them movies that are not fit for the average American, as harsh as that may sound (hey, I work with the public; I'm allowed to say that! See the website customerssuck.com for more illumination on this topic).<br /><br /> &quot;The Village&quot; is a beautiful, masterful, hypnotic gem of a movie that will stay strong in your mind for days after you have seen it, and it will stay with you for life if you let it.<br /><br /> It's too bad that the white male elite Baby Boomers who are in charge of telling us what is good and what is not in American entertainment media are so threatened by M. Night Shyamalan that they will not even give him the respect of taking his movies seriously. Hey, I guess that everything George Carlin has to say about the American elite's attitude toward &quot;brown people&quot; is true (see George Carlin's books and stand-up for more information).<br /><br /> It is very obvious to me that Shyamalan is a victim of racism -- how dare an Indian make cutting edge movies? What nerve -- his parents moved to America from India, became doctors, and sent their son to NYU. And now he is trying to show us art, and even move art into popular culture! Shouldn't those actions be reserved for the Pale Males? Aren't they in charge of popular culture? I mean, if people of color want to make nice little art house indie films about racism and such, that's fine, but make artful movies about other topics and move them into popular culture? How out of line.<br /><br /> That's the attitude I'm seeing.<br /><br /> I'm glad someone of my generation is brave enough to make films about the topics that are archetypical to Gen X-ers, such as UFO's, ghosts, and monsters in the woods. Oh, and religion.<br /><br /> Because ultimately, that is what &quot;The Village&quot; is about.<br /><br /> But you have to be able to think to figure that out.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	An amazing movie,one of the best of all time. A must see drama filled thriller
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I didn't think that they couldn't make a better snow white, I guess I was wrong, absolutely loved this one.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	Ok ... So I picked this up because everyone said it was such a good movie, it won so many awards, blah blah blah. I turned the movie on and the first 30 minutes or so were good sure but then, downhill. I must say this was the WORST film I have seen in years. I must have obviously missed something that everyone else saw! I really think people were persuaded to watch or buy this because the academy's said so. Oh yeah the movie. I started good, got unbelievable and then ended, predictable and abrupt. I'm glad I only paid $1 to rent this, otherwise I'd would be highly upset, but hey who am I. 200 + other people thought it was great. I say, go read a non-fiction book instead of wasting 2 hours of your life that you'll never get back.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is the best comedian ever! You can watch this movie over and over and every time he will have you rolling on the floor with laughter! If you are thinking about buying this dvd, DO IT! You wont regret it. What makes him the best comedian to me is his puppets, because each one has its own unique personality and he becomes each one so perfectly!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE! LOVE IT! MY 2 YR OLD LOVES CARS AND I WENT AND PURCHASED THIS MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT IS GREAT NO SCRATCHES ITS LIKE NEW! THANKS GREAT PRODUCT!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie is adorable and is all about discovering your true self, not just the one you show to the world. Love it!! Also the Bluray version on a 1080p screen looks amazing!! Great price for a combo pack.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"Couldn't even pause the film to answer the door or a call of nature, that's how exciting it was, and yet at the end of the day we felt a little cheated out of something.  Yes, the movie resembles the HK INTERNAL AFFAIRS, but that was so long ago I forgot I had seen it till the very end of TD.  I guess maybe its reliance on an outlandish plot setup made me feel it was a little artificial as opposed to the Cassavetes-ish sense of improvisation and hyper-reality you used to get from the old De Niro-Scorsese films.  The storyline is so crazy that you felt the actors, good as they were, must have always been asking themselves, why am I in this situation again, and many of them seemed to bark out their insanely violent Monahan dialogue only by biting the inside of their mouths to keep from laughing.<br /><br />Nicholson seems like he's into it, and he made the movie much better than it is at heart, by really unleashing for once that tragic power we all know he has but hasn't emerged since the Joker took over.  Is it true that Jack got the part after Daniel Day Lewis turned it down?  If so, good for Dan, he made room for a better man.<br /><br />Matt and Leo were both in there swinging, but they should have traded parts, and as for the divine Vera Farmiga, she must have thought the movie was about a woman's sexual growth, but too late she found out it was about a bunch of guys and how arteries explode under gunfire.  Scorsese and his screenwriter took care to expand her part and to shield MS from further accusations that he is running a billionaire boys club in Hollywood, but alas Vera failed to score the critical acclaim Cate Blanchett did in THE AVIATOR.  But she was a cartoon and Farmiga was trying to play someone real.<br /><br />The picture was long, but it was rushed too, and not a single one of the sequences would hold up if you took the time to analyze what was happening within the story structure.  Every minute was unbelievable, especially Leo and Vera making love, finding shared passion while Van Morrison belts out ""Comfortably Numb"" on the soundtrack like the angel of decrepitude."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Every movie becomes better and better.  The graphics are supreme, the story line is excellent. Each movie you see all the Hogswart students grow both in stature and in their knowledge of their particular art.<br />  Ms Rowling's technique in her writing leaves you craving for more and more never-ending. After you have been hooked with the Sorcerer Stone, and after you have finished devouring each novel, your left with a bittersweet knowledge that there are only so many stories to go before its over.<br />  What would it take for MS Rowling's to add a few more novels to the series, even though the characters will and have become adults???
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"I kid you not, this one delivers the goods and then some! The Departed is a remake of Infernal Affairs (2002), an excellent Hong Kong crime film. This is one of the rare times where a remake surpasses the original, actually improving on it. I love the way screenwriter Monahan adapted the script for Boston; it flows perfectly and makes all the sense in the world. Nicholson's character, Frank Costello, was modeled after James ""Whitey"" Bulger, the biggest gangster there ever was in Boston (still #2 on the FBI's most wanted list). A lot of what's going on is very plausible; after all, Scorsese is an expert on the subject, having grown in the mean streets of New York as a kid.<br /><br />I won't go over the details of the plot as I'm sure by now you know what the film's about (crook (Damon) graduates from police academy to infiltrate cops and cop (DiCaprio) passes for a crook to infiltrate crooks). Damon and DiCaprio give some of the best performances of their career. Nicholson is awesome as usual, but even better in the sense that he pushes the envelope and plays a character that is more than just Jack being Jack. Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin all turn in stellar performances. If you're a fan of Scorsese, by now you're familiar with his seventies selections for backgroung music; tradition he keeps here (plus a song from the Dropkick Murphys, ""I'm Shipping Up to Boston""). The cinematography is beautiful, as in all other Scorsese films. The editing is tight and the direction, well, it's Scorsese, so it's flawless, what did you expect?<br /><br />As for the special features disc, it kicks butt and takes names. Three very interesting documentaries (including Scorsese on Scorsese, an 85 minute sit-down with the man himself; worth the price of admission alone) and some deleted scenes. So if you're wondering whether you should spend the extra bucks for the 2-disc edition, go for it, it's well worth it.<br /><br />Not since Goodfellas has a Scorsese film been so powerful and so riveting. With its mix of ghoulish humor and excessive violence, The Departed is destined to become a crime classic, joining the ranks of the afore-mentioned Goodfellas, Godfather saga, Scarface, and Heat. If you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for, laddie? Get yourself a copy of this powerhouse of a movie. Come Oscar time, Marty deserves to get a little statuette at long last!"
B0006989TE	5.0	b	This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat & will also keep you guessing.  Great ending!!!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	...  and its not over yet.  The Harry Potter series keeps getting better and better.  They do a marvelous job on each film.  Order of the Phoenix is the best film, it tops them all.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I can't believe the technology of Pixar these days!  The movie's attention to detail and high resolution is absolutely awesome and in HD its worth the upgrade from DVD to Bluray.  Storyline is great as always.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	An entertaining retelling of a familiar story that doesn't shy away from its dark side. Good acting and great effects.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	This movie is a great one to watch for anybody that likes a bit of action. The plot's great, the actors do a very nice job (DiCaprio actually does some great acting, even after he threw a funny African accent in Blood Diamond), and the music blended with the movie very well. Of course, you gotta like Nicholson. I can't tell if the man is really off his rocker or if he's just one heck of a good actor. He's ruthless and cruel, yet his role as an Irish mob boss is pretty much perfect. I was so glad that this film won so many awards.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham is our FAVORITE!  My husband and I have watched ""Arguing With Myself"" at least 100 times and still laugh the entire time!  This one is equally funny and already has us in stitches!  We are going to see his act live in December...CAN'T WAIT!"
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	This is a decent movie. I like the plot. I haven't had a chance to check out all the extra BD-Live features yet, but the movie itself is just like Spiderman, Batman, Hulk, Transformers etc so if you are into those movies, you'll like this one too.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"This should be required veiwing in every school. Kids would reallly know what is happening with their food and how the government has ruined the farming and food supply in the United States. While they force healthcare reform through the house, they are responsible for killing more people with their ""cheap food"" then anything other cause."
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	This movie helped explain the alien sitting in the chair killed by the other alien.  It shows dead alien was wearing some type of suit.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This dvd will make you laugh until you hurt.  It is so funny.  I think Jeff Dunham is one of the best comedians.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	This movie would be worth watching just to see Luna Lovegood. However, since it is also the 5th in the Harry Potter series, it is nearly mandatory. This is a much darker film than anything that has come before in the ongoing saga. Admittedly there were parts of the book that I really do think should have been left in (Cho/Hermione rivalry, etc.) but the end result is still up to the Harry Potter standard. Best part: Luna's voice. Disc two was a bit of a disappointment. Yes, Tonks singing is rather cool, but I had hoped to see more of the cast.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000S6LS66"">Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity</a><br />Jeff Dunham is amazing in his work, this is a must see for all his fans."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Ben Stein is a joke and a fool. That movie is only good for laughs at the weak attempts of discrediting science.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"The master of all things movies and mafia, Martin Scorsese, returns to top form with 'The Departed.' The Oscar-less director's new film is his best since 'Goodfellas,' and the best film of the year by far.<br /><br />He once again reinvents the crime genre, taking an ingeniously plotted story and through his vintage techniques, as well as a fantastic cast, he elevates a cops-and-mobsters crime thriller to the level of a Shakespearean tragedy.<br /><br />Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is the kingpin of the Irish mob in South Boston. Everyone in his neighborhood fears him. That fear allows him to do practically anything, from hitting on store owners' underage daughters, to telling off Catholic priests about their scandals. He's got his hands in everything from protection to drugs to selling defense microchips to the Chinese. Everyone from the feds to the ""staties"" (state police) wants him.<br /><br />So Boston's Special Investigations Unit sends in a spy to help build a case to bring Costello down. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-headed young cop fresh out of the academy with family ties to Costello. He goes deep undercover (he's forced to serve jail time to make him more convincing to Costello and his crew) and after a while he's a familiar among Costello's crime affiliates.<br /><br />Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the police department, Costello has been grooming his own rat into a top-notch cop. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) grew up under Frank's wing, idolizing him almost as a father figure. He's a promising young officer, and quickly works his way through the ranks until he gets promoted into the SIU.<br /><br />But soon the boys learn of each other's existence (not their identities) and they're out to discover the other rat before they are found out themselves. This plot setup leads to some suspenseful sequences, including a superior one when a confrontation between the cops and Costello is coming down to the wire and the cops and Frank continually get tipped off by their respective moles. There is also another terrific scene when Colin finds Billy's number and calls him. Billy picks up knowing it's Colin and both say nothing. The tension is extreme.<br /><br />Scorsese shines here more than he has in years, mostly due to the subject matter. Sure the story takes place in Boston and not in his beloved New York this time around, but Scorsese is the perfect candidate for depicting these kinds of neighborhoods and telling these kinds of violent, dense, darkly hilarious crime/mob stories.<br /><br />The cast is an embarrassment of Oscar-worthy performances. DiCaprio and Damon both show what they're made in their best performances yet. DiCaprio is a pool of rage, remorse, fear, and paranoia. Damon shows off his dark side, but allows just enough of charm to ease through as so not to make Colin completely hateful. Nicholson tones down the ""Joker"" long enough to showcase some real menace as Costello. Supporting characters Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg (playing Billy's bosses), Alec Baldwin (as a sergeant who really wants to get Costello), and Ray Winstone (as Frank's right-hand man Mr. French) all shine and each get a moment of their own. Vera Farmiga (from the just-as-violent mess 'Running Scared') appears as a police therapist who falls for both Colin and Billy. Some might complain that this love triangle is a clich&eacute; and doesn't really belong here, but that's merely a quibble. It actually provides a nice twist or two in the story.<br /><br />The film may not be the most original or artistic film of the year, but it certainly qualifies as the most entertaining endeavor the cinema has had to offer all year long. And you just can't find a more crowd-pleasing and emotionally satisfying ending in any film this year.<br /><br />The film is unsentimental yet completely involving. Shocking plot twists shock us even more because the film, running at a brisk two hours and 30 minutes, has taken the time to invest in these characters and their lives and fates.<br /><br />So maybe this will finally get Scorsese that way-hay overdue Oscar. And even if he doesn't, 'The Departed' is some of his best work ever and an American crime masterpiece."
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	Somewhere between the genius of Batman & Spiderman essence and the extreme ComicBookesqueness of Starship Troopers.  Simplistic, similar messages for all, but separated works by the means and methods of the execution.  Downey is a bit clownish and never really a convincing character in his minimal dialogue, slapstickish role - starts and ends as a 2-D fellow.  Not sure what Palthrow's issue and direction were but who cares,  Jeff Bridges came off solid and believable as the egomaniac come of age.  Storyline and plot are chop shopish at best and connected only by the action.<br />Overall, entertaining 2hours worthy of three stars and a rental.  In rank with the hulk and fantastic four but not quite the 'man' enough to keep pace and face with the spider, bat, and super.
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	my boys love this show ,from my now 5 year old to my now 2 years old boy they watch it every other night and i had went to a few online store with the constant viewing the disc gets scratched all the time when handled the wrong way i have purchased this dvd in the pass and it was exspensive but on amazon i find myself a whole new world at a fraction of the price ....
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"For all of you ""thinkers"" who have, in their reviews, called the rest of us idiots for ""not getting"" this movie, let me pose a question to you.  Did you not see the previews for this movie before it was released?  Do you not continue to see the ads for this movies at the DVD release?  They marketed this movie as something that it IS NOT!  This is not a horror movie, not a mystery, and I would barely call it a thriller.  It was certainly marketed heavily as such, but it only exists for the so-called twist.  Because of this, it's no wonder that most people were disappointed.  Give me a break."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is awesome - I could watch this DVD over and over and still laugh my head off every time!
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	Hollywood just keeps cranking out these lousy movies.  This one was a tad better then Battleship, which gets my vote for worst movie of the year.  This movie just never took off, never got really rolling.  It was a pathetic attempt to spin a classic story with Lord of the Rings, complete with dwarfs.  I was glad when it was finally over.  So glad it will be going back to video store.  Don't waste your time on this.  Really aching for a solid movie.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	Well, it seems as if M. Night Shyamalan has found his formula and will work it in to whatever film he makes, regardless of how well it may or may not fit.  In the case of the Village, we have a beautifully recreated 19th century town, a flawless cast, and a genuinely creepy concept to work with.  It seems that with all that, adding the 'Shyamalan Twist' would be unnecessary; and it was!  Shyamalan is a truly gifted filmmaker and has created some amazing and frightening film moments, however, applying the same formula for the fourth time seems to reveal a level of insecurtiy or fear, that an artist of his calibre should have outgrown by now.  For those who have seen the film, imagine what this film would have been if the monsters were real!  It would have forced Shyamalan to NOT add the twist at the end, because there would have been no reason to! But it seems that he wanted the suprise ending there at all costs, and in this case, it cost him the chance to finally break the mold and mature as an artist.  In his previous films, the twist was essential to the story, it made everything make sense.  In the Village, the story is essential to the twist, it just feels forced.  All and all there are some really creepy moments and some really good performances; but these seem somewhat wasted on a film that could have been so much more than a rehash of the same old formula.  PLEASE Night, try something else next time!
B001684L0A	3.0	b	For a non-American, this portrait of a Founding Father. John Adams, his colleagues, adversaries and fellow revolutionaries is nevertheless fascinating, reminding us that these people were not gods, but flawed and struggling human beings.  The production is respectful without romanticising or falling into hagiography.  The love story 'B-plot', over fifty-four years, of John and Abigail is textured and affecting, particularly in the final episode.  As a drama, however, the story is at times plodding and the leaps in time, for those without a detailed knowledge of US history, can be confusing and dissatisfying.  It's not Jefferson's story, but the script is also a little coy about the Hemmings at Monticello...  That said, this is another production in which design, art department and special FX are totally integrated and impeccably researched and realised.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE SEVERAL TIMES AND STILL LOVE IT. I DID NOT HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE, BUT I ENDED UP ENJOYING IT SO MUCH THAT I AM ORDERING IT NOW. I INTEND ON SHARING THIS WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS.......WILL MAKE NICE STOCKING STUFFERS.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"WOW! A lot of the reviews posted here are just plain stupid! Allow me to explain if your attention span will permit. After seeing (NO, SUFFERING THROUGH) the overlong, humorless, and just plain EVIL movie entitled THE DARK KNIGHT, I was ready to believe that all anyone ever wants nowadays are dry, dull and just plain serious (""realistic"") movies. Anyone with an ounce of perspicacity can deduce that NONE of the Indiana Jones films are ""serious"" or ""realistic"" in any way. You folks have been fooled. Did anyone see ""Temple of Doom""? That was the only 'classic' Indy film to get the comic book/adventure formula correct, and most people whined and complained about it. How sad. As dark as that great film was, it was nothing if not absolute fantasy. All of the Indy films are fantasies. There is no difference from ghosts emerging from the mythical Ark of the Covenant than there is in aliens flying away in a space ship. These movies are not jejune in nature; they merely ask you to believe like a child again (something most of you have forgotten how to do). A huge part of the Indy history is that the films themselves are based on movie serials and comics from the 30s and 40s. Not everything has to be heart attack serious folks. While this movie is not great, I really do enjoy the fact that it is cartoonish and fun, as opposed to the awful and serious DARK KNIGHT movie. That piece of crap was NOT for kids, and both young and old should reject it vehemently. However, Indy 4 is just meant to be a fun movie, and nowadays no one can handle that. RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK was too good for its own good (as the filmmakers forgot that it was merely a tribute/semi-parody and did a very nice job in ""perfecting"" it in other ways) and people thought that Indy was supposed to be taken ""seriously."" This is why Indy 2 was such a shock; really, that film should have been Indy 1, and then those of us who are truly fans of this character would have been on the right track from the start. How can you not enjoy seeing Harrison in his trademark outfit again? Calling the man ""too old"" (my favorite ignorant quibble amongst movie zombies) is just plain ridiculous. The man knows how to crack a whip, and crack the whip he does. It's just too bad that he didn't use that baby on the intolerable Shia LeBouf before leaving the set of this noble (but deeply flawed) attempt at recapturing lightning in a bottle. (By the way, the Jones films are not Bible stories. Professor Jones is an expert on the occult and mystical things, not Biblical history. Apparently, Lucas and Spielberg do not pay attention to the dialogue in their own scripts. ""Temple of Doom"" was the only movie to put the intrepid adventurer's esoteric knowledge to any reasonable use, and more of his adventures should reflect his true occupational interests. However, read the paperback spin-off novels to follow up on my little tidbit.)"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Although not as well known as other Marvel Comic icons as Spiderman or X Men, this film adaptation of Iron Man works due to the sure hand of director Jon Favreau (Swingers, Elf) who cleverly mixes action, drama, humor, and a totally winning performance by comeback actor, Robert Downey Jr.  In terms of a first film showing a superhero's origin, it is the one of the best to date.<br /><br />Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer whose cavalier attitude and playboy appetite are matched only by his sheer genius in technology.  On a tour of his weaponry in Afghanistan, he is wounded in the heart by shrapnel and captured by rebels who order him to build a super weapon of mass destruction.  With the help of another civilian, Stark changes up and instead builds a powerful suit of high tech armor that sustains his weak heart and enables his escape but not without a price.  Guilt ridden and traumatized by his experiences, Stark has a literal change of heart and alters the militaristic direction of his company much to the chagrin of his elder partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).  A couple of friends, his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and military liaison, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), stick loyally by Stark's side despite his earlier predilections.  Intent on improving and perfecting his Iron Man suit, Stark experiments with its design and takes dangerous risks.  His mission is to utilize his Iron Man technology to fight the evil in the world, starting first in Afghanistan.  When the truth comes out about what Stark Industries is really doing with weapons sales, it leads to a deeper conspiracy and a battle of titans as Iron Man meets an old foe.<br /><br />Buffed and in terrific physical condition, Downey is quite convincing as the prodigy whose initial devil-may-care attitude must undergo a transformation.  (It is not without irony that the role and the person should merge in light of Downey's real life, personal setbacks.)  The movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes the most of his role.  Bridges is great at playing a businessman with a sinister agenda.  Paltrow strikes sparks with Downey and you yearn for more scenes with the two of them.  The same goes for Howard as Stark's best friend.  What is a little hard to swallow is how Pepper and Rhodes could put up with such a pompous persona in the early goings.<br /><br />Favreau has an amusing bit part as an assistant to Stark.  Further, the robotic voice that assists Stark in his technological work is actor Paul Bettany!  And yes, Stan (the man) Lee, one of the comic book creators, has a fleeting cameo.<br /><br />The scenes, which show Stark developing his updated Iron Man suit and test-driving it, are realistic and at times amusing.  The Iron Man suit 2.0 is a marvel of construction and is the coolest thing imaginable. There is no way that this concept of a hero could have been rendered as convincingly even a few years ago.  My how movie magic has caught up with these stories finally and done them justice.  It is clever how the film incorporates the original Iron Man design (which brings to mind a sort of poor man's version of Robocop) and progresses through its more modernized version.  Pure fans of the original comic (including myself) are thrilled at the reverence paid to the classic beginnings.<br /><br />There is an aerial battle between American fighter jets and Iron Man that is a lot of fun.  The special effects, while being among the most realistic and cleverly used in any action film, are well integrated with the strong narrative.  Despite the eye candy, you get the feeling that the filmmakers never lose sight of what the story is about and how to stay focused on the characters.  The pacing is excellent.<br /><br />In terms of subplots, the Afghan conflict hits close to home with the current war in Iraq.  Also, the secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gets an introduction as support for Stark and figures to have a bigger role in future Marvel movies; don't forget to stay until the credits are done for a bonus.  The film has an edge about it in dialogue and theme, and is better for it especially in the final scene, which is surprising and has implications for future adventures.<br /><br />I would put this film on par with Batman Begins and Spiderman, not bad company.  While not as emotionally stirring as the best moments of X Men United or Spiderman 2, this is only the first of what likely will be a long running franchise.  If the sequel can maintain the same quality as this effort, we could be in for the best superhero movie yet!  And lest there be any doubt about Favreau's ability to take on comic heroes, don't worry; he understands what they mean and how to do them justice.  He `get's it'!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I love all the Harry Potter movies and this one is no exeption.  A bit darker than the previous ones and of course there are always things that are left out from the book, but definitely a must-have for your collection.
B000S5KGH4	1.0	b	"Jeff Dunham is a racist.  His ""characters"" are mostly based on blatant stereotypes that are immediately offensive to anyone with any sort of empathy towards the feelings of others.  These are not clever jokes based on the differences of diverse cultures.  These are insulting caricatures on the same level as black face or buck toothed ""ching chong ding dong"" characters. I was shocked to discover that something this tasteless existed in the new millennium, let alone that a talentless ""comic"" could hide his inability to tell jokes behind this disgusting display.  Now excuse me while I go try desperately to forget that I saw this."
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	I had been anxiously awaiting the release of this film for over a year and it delivered on all aspects.  Like many of Scott's films you enjoy Prometheus even more the second time around.  I am looking forward to the DVD release with director commentary.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Freedom is not an easy task. We have gotten spoiled. Watch and learn! The tragedies can happen again.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"The main premise of the movie is that a supposed ideology of 'Darwinism' is entrenched in academe and disallows any dissent of its views.  Stein makes the point that this goes against the ideal of free speech and more specifically, academic freedom.  What is being disallowed is the recent evolutionary alternative, intelligent design.  To support his argument, Stein proceeds by presenting profiles of several researchers who have been either reprimanded, castigate or fired for trying to publish or suggest that certain biological structures can only be the result of an intelligent designer.  Along with this expose, other positions or ideas dealing with intelligent design, religion and science get misrepresented throughout.<br /><br />Stein starts by interviewing Richard Sternberg where he mentions that his life was nearly ruined when he published a pro-intelligent design article by Stephen Meyer.  But scientists previously rejected the paper because of shoddy science; not because it talked about ID.  So the paper didn't meet the standards of the journal.  Sternberg also went around the normal peer-review process.  Regarding his firing, He gave notice 6 months to the Smithsonian prior to the paper's publication.  Also, his position at the Smithsonian was an unpaid position which was extended to 2006.  The paper was about the Cambrian explosion, not about the origin of life as stated by Stein.  So the first case that Stein builds quickly unravels in light of the facts.  (The expelledexposed.com website makes short shrift of the rest of the individuals allegedly persecuted by those 'intolerant Darwinists'.)  Later on, Sternberg quips that ID (or the whole controversy over it) is going to be settled by evidence and argument... something I failed to see throughout the movie.<br /><br />Eugenie Scott gets a say and she sums it up nicely; ""If they [intelligent design proponents] have a way of understanding nature that is superior to the one we all are making lots of discoveries with, great.  Bring it on.""  And interestingly, there is a heading on the dvd called ""applications"" where some of the IDers talk about how thinking in ID has supposedly given them new insights in their respective fields of research.  For instance, Jonathan Wells talked about centromeres acting like a motor in the cell.  This sounds a lot like the bacterial flagellum example (that has been taken apart by Kenneth Miller, along with their blood-clotting cascade example).  I found that there wasn't anything profound in their perspectives that couldn't be had using an evolutionary one.  If anything, evolutionary biologists point out bad, kludgy designs where things hardly look designed at all.  Presupposing that there is some grand designer behind biology doesn't help scientists trying to understand how nature works.  The IDers haven't 'brought it on'.<br /><br />In one episode, Wells remarks that evolution can't explain how species change over time.  But there are several counter-examples; finches studies by the Grants, stickleback fish adapting to isolated lakes and streams, 500 species of cichlids evolved in East Africa's Lake Victoria, antibiotic resistance in bacteria, Richard Lenski's experiments on the evolution of E. coli, etc.<br /><br />Midway through, a somewhat sombre tone develops where Stein looks shaken as he tours an asylum (where the nazis eliminated the mentally-handicapped).  But then he ends by pointing the finger back at 'Darwinism'--completely deflated any sympathies that Stein had just built up in me.  Darwin wasn't any more responsible for nazi atrocities than Christ was responsible for the inquisition.  Playing the Nazi moral card on Darwin is a cheap, flimsy tactic when other arguments seem to have run dry or come up empty.  Major FAIL.<br /><br />The origins of life section skews what is current in abiogenesis where again, Stein cherry-picks and caricatures some of the more radical ideas in the field.  Take the directed panspermia example promoted by Francis Crick (codiscover of DNA).  Stein remarks deadpan that Crick thinks aliens did it; or he cynically listens to Ruse talk about a crystal substrate as a template for proteins.  His announcement of Miller's attempt to jumpstart? life is a misconstrual of the purpose behind Miller's experiments.<br /><br />Stein; ""Everyone agrees that life started with a single cell.""  No<br /><br />Throughout the movie, black and white footage is interjected (from East Berlin to The Planet of the Apes footage to guillotines, etc.) in an attempt to cinematically drive the point home about intolerance, bullying, totalitarianism, etc.  This just seemed all the more revolting and time-wasting in light of all the misrepresentations and straw men one had to endure.  Stein's every-once-in-a-while 'Darwinism' drone is just grating.  And the Casino of Life cartoon where Dawkins is at a slot machine trying to 'win' a protein sequence is the high point of this docu-nonsense.<br /><br />Other ideas are bandied around in the movie such as eugenics, free will, society.  Certain episodes swing casually from Darwin to Hitler and back again.  Fuller's idea that Darwinism leads to a deprivileging of humans is so off the mark.  If the society is so under the grip of Darwinism, why is there such a current worldwide instillment of human rights then?  You don't see this idea in vogue during the middle ages for example.  What a sloppy history lesson.<br /><br />A central philosophical theme that seems to underpin the movie is the difference between naturalism and supernaturalism.  Science eschews supernaturalism for the simple reason that naturalistic explanations have produced enormous epistemic success in our understanding of nature while supernatural ones have come up empty.  And this is because supernatural hypotheses can't be subject to empirical testing.  In spite of supposedly showing applications--where thinking intelligent design has lead to new insights or discoveries in the life sciences, the argument could equally be made that these discoveries were the result of thinking natural selection.  Having an intelligent designer (or God) fill in what science can't is just the old God-of-the-gaps argument.  In spite of what Stein suggests to the contrary, religion and science *are* unrelated.<br /><br />Final Mark: D minus with major remedial reading in evolutionary biology, abiogenesis, philosophy of science and ethics."
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater. I enjoyed it even more on Bluray. It looks and sounds amazing. Both disc are loaded with special features, with the second disc containing 3/4 of them.<br /><br />I have to say, when I was in the theater watching the movie, the lighting of the film, just seamed off to me, it seamed OVER lit. Plus there were scenes that had some CGI looking added effects. All 4 movies had scenes  like that. BUT, I don't care. I STILL enjoyed this movie a lot and I have to say, all that weird lighting and CGI blends much better on the small screen. I actually think the lighting looks like the other films do on DVD.<br /><br />Over all I highly recommend this on Bluray. It looks amazing. What a fun ride. I can't wait for the orginals to arrive on Bluray someday.<br /><br />Let me just say, I go to see a movie to have fun. I am not a person who sits and nit picks a movie a part.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	This movie is not a thriller but a clever attack on all secret societies, especially organized religion.  The village is a self-contained community maintained by fear of the outside and its leaders are manipulators in keeping power.<br /><br />Substitute Christianity for the Village and you have a marvellous attack on religion.  But how many viewers will really see this?
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This comedy is so funny i had tears in my eyes. Walter, Peanut and Bubba J are hilarious.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	We love this series- this is the first Harry Potter movie to stick almost exactly to the book, thank goodness.  They did such a great job with this movie, I can't wait to see the second part.  Very impressed. I'd recommend it to any Harry Potter fan, esp if you get annoyed at the changes that are made to movies made from books- this one is refreshingly close to the book.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I highly recommend it to anyone.  Whether you are a<br />Christian looking for inspiration to give out sacrificial love<br />Or a person seeking a way to save their marriage, this<br />Movie is definitely worth watching.  Its the only movie<br />That I am willing to watch repeatedly.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I think this is one of the great movies of all time and I love the 3D.  Its just great
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	I love Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBoeuf, but I did not love Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. I very much enjoyed the nods to previous Indiana Jones films, and the cinematography and special effects were excellent.<br /><br />This outing didn't have the excitement and cohesiveness of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the sheer spectacle of The Temple of Doom, or the charm and heart of The Last Crusade. That said, this movie had some wonderful high points. If you don't like ants, there's a scene you should skip.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this film for children under the age of five as there are a few scenes that might give them nightmares. This is an ideal adventure movie to watch with your older children.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Great product, was exactly as described works perfectly. I watch this movie every yr with my kids or Christmas, I am unable to be home this yr and am happy to have found this copy. It was shipped quickly and I received it in plenty of time to watch it on Christmas where I am while my kids watched it at home.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This was a must have after watching this at the theatre. Iron Man had all the qualities that made it an excellent movie great acting, effects, directing etc. Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Sparks from his look to his attitude and when Iron Man shows up wow. If any Marvel movie should be bought its this.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This miniseries is captivating. Well casted and need I say more... It is an Emmy winner, for sure...
B001684L0A	5.0	b	For someone who knows next to nothing about American history, this series was a real eye opener. One forgets that the French Revolution and the American War of Independence were so close philosophically, and so important in the history of democratic ideals that are now commonplace throughout the developed world. What I really liked about this series was the wonderful, nuanced performances of the two leads - Laura Linney is superb - and the gorgeous, spare, almost monochromatic cinematography revelling in the puritan taste for simplicity in dress, architecture, furnishings, and speech for that matter, especially compared to pre-revolutionary France's excess of richesse, frippery and duplicity. There is a tangible sense of the times portrayed: you can feel it in the silence (no phones, no TV, no radio, no traffic, no sirens, no motors) and in the sense of time passing so differently, journeys taking so terribly long, messages even longer to pass from one to another. And I also thought the casting was fabulous. George Washington was uncanny. Beautiful score, too. VERY highly recommended.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Save yourself the money and watch any of the many movies that this one copied - all of them are better than this schlock. Kristen Stewart can't emote, much less act (is 20-something too young to overdose on botox?) Charlize Theron chewed so much scenery it's a wonder she has any teeth left, and Hemsworth sounded like he was trying to spit out his lines while holding a mouthful of nails. The dwarves were the only redeeming part and they were vastly underused.<br />And no, I'm not a Twilight fan so I'm not writing a negative review because I feel betrayed by Stewarts's stupidity, though it certainly explains why the director decided to use her. I want my money back!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	If you love to laugh, then you absolutely HAVE to own this dvd! Jeff Dunham is a talented comedian and excellent ventriloquist. Put both those talents together with some crazy impressive looking puppets and you've got one amazing act! From start to finish you will LOVE this dvd! Especially how he interacts with the audience.<br /><br />You really can't beat the price either. They're practically giving it away! I suggest purchasing more than one, because if you lend out your copy, you may not get it back!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I enjoyed the movies, and was pleased at the speed of delivery.<br />I pre-ordered it about a week before the dvd came out, and received it the day after it hit the shelves.<br />Thanks
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	it is great because you can keep the blu ray for the collection and give the kids the dvd to destroy lol
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	This movie was a visual feast. I was surpised to adore Kristen Stewart in this film. The entire cast was magnificent; the cinematography and costumes were nothing short of stunning. I wept at the beauty of it, on so many levels.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	I was very disappointed in this series.  I do not have HBO but am a huge Sookie Stackhouse fan so I bought the series.  Did I get an eye full...LITERALLY!!  The story of Jason sets off into a porn story and every episode has at least one scene of his debauchery.  I was disgusted.  I spent more time fast-forwarding the series than watching it.<br /><br />Some areas follow the story but it's not filmed in first person as the books are written.  There were so many side stories I would get confused on what was going on (of course I skipped a lot of it too).  This never happened in the books.  The sex scenes were very explicit and should be more of an X rating than an R.  I can't believe that this stuff exists on TV.  Now I'm glad I never wasted the money on HBO.<br /><br />If you like porn, then perhaps you would like this series.  Otherwise, I'd steer clear.  I had ordered the 2nd series at the same time I purchased this one.  As soon as I intermittently watched (fast-forwarding through a lot of it) the first season, I cancelled my order for the second.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  Read the books again if you love them.  This series will just ruin the storylines for you if you watch them.  It will decorate the inside of my garbage can until the garbage man picks it up.  Very sad.  It is such a good series...I hated to see more good books trashed by Hollywood.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	about as scary as a wet sponge...ending about is shocking as two wet sponges...dialouge about as intense as three wet..., well you get the idea...out of sominex, pop this baby in the dvd player and you're on your way to snoozeville
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	The Departed is, in short, a stunning achievement from director Martin Scorsese, who gleefully returns to the hard-hitting gangster genre that made him famous. Joining him in his return is one of the better casts you'll likely find in one movie, and all of these elements combined make this one a must see.<br /><br />  I don't usually give a plot description because anyone who has read this far down the page probably already knows as much or more than they wanted without actually seeing the film. To put it simply, Jack Nicholson plays the only clearly definable bad-guy in the film. Everyone else is morally iffy at best. This is definitely not a movie for those seeking characters to admire or root for, although it's so involving and played so well that you'll likely find yourself rooting for just about everyone regardless.<br /><br />  The performances in this film make this film, period. Jack Nicholson is spectacular as only Jack can be. He's basically here to remind the audience what a commanding and terrific actor he is, especially as a villain. He's equally terrifying and hilarious and, as always, it seems so effortless. Matt Damon also continues to prove his chops in a tricky role of dual personalities and dual motives. He brings across both his Good Will Hunting charm and his Jason Bourne brooding to great effect. His role is complex, to say the least, and you don't really know his true nature until the climax.<br /><br />  The real star of this show, however, turns out to be Leonardo DiCaprio.  His outstanding performance is a revelation of his true talent, and it's safe to say that I was absolutely blown away by it. He perfectly blends a tough guy (and he is tough) with a regular guy that wants no part of all of that ugliness. He is completely desperate throughout, both in his current situation caught torn between cops and gangsters, as well as his long-time desire to rid himself of his family's shameful legacy. DiCaprio makes you believe all of this from beginning to end, and if any acting awards are handed out for this film, they should go to Leo (sorry Jack)!<br /><br />  The Departed also benefits from an unusually stellar supporting cast. Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin could easily headline their own film, but they all shine as role players in this one. Relative newcomer Vera Farmiga holds her own pretty well as the only female, which is pretty impressive considering that alone, not to mention the quality and reputation of the all-male cast she has to contend with.<br /><br />  This movie is definitely not for children or the squeamish. It's violent, gritty, brutal, sexually charged, and almost every other word is four-letters. This is easily distinguishable as a Scorsese picture and is for mature adults that can enjoy this sort of thing and not take it too seriously. That said, any takers will be pleasantly surprised and thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />  The Departed is definitely not an indie movie and never feels like one. This is pure old-fashioned Hollywood in the best tradition. Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking: Hollywood is anything but consistent & these days rarely of any real quality. Granted, but every once in a while a movie like this is made and reminds us that when the stars align in the right way, it is worth the price of admission and then some.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	The Village had a disapointing surprise ending. If Shyamalan didn't end the movie the way he did it The Village would have been a great film. I am not going to tell you how it ended, but I'll just say he could've ended it by saying &quot;it was all a dream,&quot; and it would've been just as good of an ending. Although I had a fun time. A few parts made me jump, but it isn't that scary compared to &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Signs.&quot;
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"Stunning visual effects. Great entertainment. It seems like Kristen Steward always has that same sulky ""Bella' expression. Hemsworth and Theron were amazing though."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	I won't address the whole evolution versus intelligent design debate, but I will say this: this documentary is highly biased, and not in a good way.  Evolutionary concepts are grossly mishandled by the filmmakers, quotes from biologists are taken out of context, statements are made only addressing the pros without the cons on their behalf, and so on.  Even Ben Stein, who has little to no background in any of the fields of specialty, is heard in the form of voiceover dismissing and roasting every heavily edited video clip of someone from the opposing viewpoint.<br /><br />I would not have minded this movie had it showed both sides or at least gave cons with the pros to the intelligent design side, yet the filmmakers have failed to do so, instead making a very biased and intellectually insulting documentary that just serves to further confuse those who are curious about the debate.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I'm 18, almost 19 years old, and started doing this workout 3 weeks ago with my dad. I've played select fast pitch and sports my whole life, so I certainly know what a tough workout is, but this is truly the most intense, total-body, insane workout I have ever done in my life, and I absolutely love it!<br />Even after just the workout, my dad and I are already sweating, but Shaun T really does a great job at making you WANT to continue and dig deeper. Something about it just makes you want to come back day after day to continue, but you also love those recovery and break days, haha!<br />But I wanted to post this review to let people know that you're really not too young to do this. It is definitely a challenge, but no matter if you stick to it, you WILL see great results.<br />Hope this helped!<br />Happy Insanity-ing!
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	I really wanted to like this movie, and I did like some of it.  The special effects were great, the character designs were wonderful, the backgrounds were spectacular.  The Acting was good, and the casting was decent.  But the plot, and the storyline itself.  There were just so many things that were left out, or rushed, or just plain made no sense, and so much was left unresolved.  So yeah, if you want eye candy, check it out.  If you actually want a well done spin on a classic...keep looking.  Personally I liked Snow White: A Tale of Terror.  Not great effects, but excellent acting, and a really well executed storyline.  No eye candy to speak of on either side though.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Best Movie of 2008, Robert Downey Jr shows his wide range playing Tony Stark. Looking forward to all the upcomming releases from Marvel Studios.
B0032CNOK6	3.0	b	I like Ben Stein. He's a highly intelligent individual who even though was once a Presidential speechwriter for both Nixon and Ford and who first gained national prominence as an economist, was able to later go on to a successful career in film and television, winning several Emmys.  About eight months ago I learned that Stein had made a documentary about intelligent design and people who have been ostracized from their academic jobs because of their promotion of the theory.  I am not a proponent of intelligent design, but I am a proponent of academic freedom and believe that educational institutions are supposed to be places where critical questioning, analyzing, and debate are encouraged and not suppressed.  I know from my own experiences as well as from other research that has been done, that this is not always the case and that sometimes educational institutions do the opposite of what they are supposed to do: instead of encouraging intellectual growth they actual discourage it and try to mold students into a certain way of thinking.  Therefore, after learning about Stein's movie, EXPELLED, I was intrigued and decided to see it.<br /><br />Basically, the film uses a series of interviews, documents, historical footage, and an animated video to illustrate that free speech and academic free thought aren't encouraged and supported in our educational institutions.  That is the major thrust of the film.  Unfortunately, the film goes about making its point in an unorthodox fashion by focusing on proponents of intelligent design who have been ostracized because of their beliefs and illustrating how the theories of Darwinism were a component of what led to the Holocaust. As one would imagine, this unorthodox juxtaposition has caused a massive controversy to surround the movie.<br /><br />As far a movies go, EXPELLED is pretty much an average documentary.  There is a story that is told, some of the interviews are very interesting, and the editing is excellent.  There really isn't anything new that is said or done in the film, but it is tied together in a fresh and original package.<br /><br />Some have compared the film to the movies of Michael Moore, but that's not quite the case.  Moore is famous for taking clips, sound bites, and single words completely out of context and editing them so his subject say exactly what he wants them to say.  Some of the interviewees in EXPELLED have claimed that the film is completely inaccurate because they were led to believe the movie they were being interviewed for was something different than what was actually made.  Those claims are probably true, but it doesn't discount that the things the people said weren't taken out of context and weren't edited together to make people appear to say things they really didn't.<br /><br />Ben Stein is his usual witty, irreverent self throughout most of the movie, but when the film makes its connection to the Holocaust he actually becomes emotional and the audience witnesses a side of Stein that has been rarely seen before.  There are many who claim that the film's claim of an attack upon free speech and academic free thought has very little to do with the Holocaust and is exaggerated (just look at the 1 Star reviews at Amazon.com).  That might be true.  Still, there is a connection there.  Nazi scientists weren't born overnight and their belief system, of which Social Darwinism was a part, led them to be able to commit the atrocities that they did.<br /><br />Overall, EXPELLED is an average documentary about an attack on free speech and academic thought in our educational institutions, using the controversy of intelligent design and evolution as a backdrop.  Opponents of intelligent design will probably hate the film and proponents of the movie will laud it.  If you ignore both, you might actually learn something and understand the real meaning of the movie.  Like I mentioned at the beginning, Ben Stein is a really smart guy and sometimes the smartest way to actually get people thinking is to stir up a little controversy.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Disney PIXAR should say it all.  This may be the last of its kind with the buy out of the original Pixar animations, but this one lives up to its reputation.  It is action packed and for adults as much as children, especially anyone remotely into racing!
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	This DVD is of excellent quality.  I enjoyed all the features on it.  All the bloopers and deleted scenes provided lots of extra bonus entertainment.<br />The movie is an A++++.  I'm a teacher and I was doing a series of lessons on marriage to my students.  I showed it in one of my classes.  My students (very particular and fussy young ladies I might add) loved the movie.  They wanted to miss their lunch hour in order to see the entire movie.  My colleagues said the same of her class.  This movie is inspirational and a must for those who are married or contemplating marriage one day.  Loved it!!!!!
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	"*spoilers*<br /><br />Fireman Caleb Holt is having a rocky time with his marriage, from his addiction with porn to his wife's resentment about how he's so often gone. Fights in their house are daily, from snide to yelling and with cutting remarks from both sides. When his wife, Catherine, finally tells him in tears that she just wants out, he yells back that that's fine with him. The marriage seems destined to end, until Caleb's Christian father sends him a package with a book called ""The Love Dare"", a 40-day challenge for couples on unconditional love. Caleb begins it tentatively, without telling his wife, and learns to persevere even after she gives him nothing in return.<br /><br />You can guess that things turn out well, this being a Christian film with the message to never give up. I, however, was not by any means satisfied with the actions of some of the characters by the time the movie ended. From the beginning, the couple Caleb and Catherine have iniquities between them that keep them apart: Caleb has his occasional porn addiction, his work, a bad temper, and his unconditional demand for respect; Catherine has a flirting man at work who treats her better than her husband does, stupid negative friends that tell her to give up, biting sarcasm, and her unconditional demand for respect. Both are convinced that the other's the problem; both have issues they need to work on. The problem is, both of them do NOT end up focusing on fixing themselves. For the first 50 minutes of the film, Caleb does all the work in the marriage.<br /><br />I understand that love is about giving relentlessly without expecting a reward, but I found some of Catherine's treatment of her husband to be inexcusably rude. He buys her flowers, she sniffs at them; he makes her coffee, she stalks out; he says he'll take care of something important, she grouches that he should have done it already. After he fixes her dinner, she coldly says she doesn't love him. Then, after he gets rid of his own final hurdle by destroying all his computer software and leaves a note saying he loves her, she leaves the divorce papers on his desk. Now, some of this is understandable; what I realized after watching this movie again was that Catherine was, simply put, very scared and confused. After the dinner scene, the film shows her crying in bed. After Caleb's failed first attempts to please her, the film shows her telling her friends about it and being told in return that, in their experience, he's probably just trying to butter her up for the divorce (this, and the fact that Caleb's heart wasn't really in it for the first few tasks and Catherine could tell, explains why she wasn't receptive to him). But you can certainly feel Caleb's terrible frusteration when her biggest rejection comes about. He endures this heartbreak in silence, still doing everything he can to please her, even tending to her while she's sick in bed. And at this point, I think Catherine could have opened up a little more; Caleb had been in earnest for some time. All this sacrifice, all this enduring of her snipishness, wins him nothing but an ""I am not ready to trust you again"" from her when she's sick in bed, after finding the Love Dare book. The scene ends with her softening, but really; enough is enough. Though I sympathized with Catherine, there were times when I thought she was just a spoiled brat, especially while she was accepting the flirtatious behavior of that jerk-doctor at work while her husband was treating her well AND trying so hard to save their marriage. Even when she finally ran to the firehouse to re-declare her love for him, even then, it didn't show her literally say ""I'm sorry"" for her own disrespect to him. Why? I guess the filmmakers focused more on their embrace and her love declaration at the moment and apologies occured in private, but it would have been NICE to hear an ""If I haven't told you I'm sorry, I am"" right after her ""If I haven't told you I forgive you, I have"" line.<br /><br />Not only was Caleb the only one to really offer a lengthy apology, but I noticed that the men were the ones who came out apologizing more: for instance, Caleb finds out that his mother was the one who used the Love Dare in his parents' marriage, not his father. And something else about Caleb's mother: she annoyed me. When Caleb first went to his parents to let off steam about his marriage, his mother started nagging him about how Catherine must have felt working all the time and needing help. What, and Caleb didn't work? Pulling people out of burning buildings, putting his life at risk? Are you forgetting your son does this, woman? And could use some appreciation from his po' little woman now and then? She misses the entire point of listening, and Caleb understandably wants to speak to his father alone then. Later in the film, though, when Caleb finds out his mother and not his father was the one who did the Love Dare, he runs home and weepily asks her forgiveness. For what? My mom, who watched the film with me, said that he'd been short with his mom, but I didn't notice that; what I saw was the old fussy cutting him off and giving him a lecture instead of listening when he needed her. Once again poor Caleb apologized his guts out, even when it seemed unnecessary, to a woman who had not been giving him all HE needed in the relationship either.<br /><br />Caleb's mother and wife are not the only examples of women in the film acting in irritating ways. Part of the reason that Catherine's so confused about Caleb and her marriage is that she has some very stupid and gossiping friends advising her. While Caleb has wise male friends telling him not to give up, his wife has a bunch of gossiping snits for friends who egg her on, tell her to force her husband to respect her, and encourage her to drop him. Every action she reports from her husband, they sneer at and second-guess for the worst. When one of the biddies overhears Catherine's husband doing something noble for her, she decides not to tell her about it! Catherine's friends had no business telling her to get out of her marriage, and if she had, a great deal of it would have been due to the fact that those foolish and irresponsible women were goading her by painting her husband as a villain and not even bothering to tell her when he did something nice! I hoped that Catherine would tell them off in the end, or at least be shown giving them a glowing report of Caleb, but she never does; the lazy gossips never pay for their actions in the film.<br /><br />This is undoubtedly a rare film with an amazing message; some parts were just a little much for my nerves, one being the Southern-slurring elderly father with his corny messages and automatic sermons; the dad was awesome and his advice was needed, but occasionally it went a little overboard, and the Kendrick brothers should be careful not to fall into a predictable pattern here. Plus, the unfairly heavy load of accountability on the men and the partially absent responsibility of the women did not sit well with me. If the film had edited Caleb's weepy apology or perhaps Catherine had come across the Love Dare book and tried it privately herself, the film would have had a much more balanced feel. It's remarkable and beautiful. Just do some more editing next time please, guys."
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	Warning: Minor Spoliers<br /><br />For the past three years or so, I have been pretty oppossed to the Academy Awards and their Best Picture winners (the last of which I truley accepted being The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King). Million Dollar Baby was a nice movie, but it didn't stick with me in the long run. Crash was a very mediocre film that only got lucky because of its LA fan base and conservative members (Brokeback Mountain was by far superior and should have won), The Departed was pretty good but not one of my favorites of the whole year, and now, this years winner, No Country for Old Men, has won the award and so naturally, I had to see it. I've obviously heard about the raves this film has been getting, most everyone calling it a masterpiece, saying it was the best film in a long time and picked up almost every single major Best Picture awards. I figured, there must be something about the film thats so great.<br /><br />The film intwertwins three diffrent story lines that all seem to center around a drug deal gone bad. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon the massacer and along with the huge pile of drugs, finds a suitcase full of money. So naturally, he takes it. Unfortunatly for him, he has just stumbled into a dangerous situation and is now being hunted down by a hired gun name Anton Chigurh, while a local sherrif is right behind them as he tries to piece together the whole crime.<br /><br />For the positives, I definently agree that all the acting was pretty good, Javier Bardem just morphing into a great villian. With steely eyes, cold determination, he's like a walking Reaper, armed with his pressurized gun and killing almost everyone unfortunate to cross his path. Tommy Lee Jones makes the most of his small role while Josh Brolin took me by surprise with his pretty restrained performence and Kelly MacDonald also surprising me with her nice gem of a role. Even Beth Grant does wonders in her role that literally only last for over a minute. So, bravo to the actors.<br /><br />However, and this is the big however, my one big problem with this movie is this. When its all said and done, the film was really just a whole bunch of nothing. Sure, we know there's a drug deal and money and a killer and all that stuff and there was a pretty thrilling scene during the middle but its almost as if the film just obidently trudges on through the film, having its characters do all this stuff and say all these things, and by the end, what does it all add up to? Is it a film about free will? or the after match of violence? is the whole thing about violence? changing times? what was this whole movie about?<br /><br />Now, to put it out, I have never really been a Coen Brothers fan. I just don't get any of there movies. Maybe i'm just the odd one out but I honestly don't see anything when I watch there films. Blood Simple, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, all of those films I just found either very average, completly upsurd, or just plain weird. So even before I was going to view this movie, I already had an idea that this may not live up to all the hype its getting.<br /><br />Another problem I have is with the ending. Now, I don't mind open ended movies. Hell, I think that a film can be superb with an open end. But for me, when the whole thing ended, I really just thought it was almost like a complete waste of my time. Again, the whole ending added up to nothing. I ask you, what was the whole point in the sherrif's ending speech? what significance did it have with the whole of the film? why are we shown Chigurh getting hit by some car at the end? is there something there that I'm not getting? and the whole thing with the sherrif and his uncle, again, what was the whole point of that scene? are we suppose to take notice and say 'yeah, violence, its always going to be there and stuff'. And as for Woody Harrelson, can someone tell me the whole purpose of his role? I mean, did he really had anything to the story? at all?. Basically, in general, were those last 30 minutes or so ABOSULTLY nessesary?<br /><br />I really just think this film is a critics film. Something that all the professionals rave about and absolutly adore and love. But for the general public, it dosen't always translate like that. For people like me, its just a jumble of events that lead to a pretty vacant (and slightly pointless) ending. For others, its a masterpiece of a film and the critics are right to cheer and its one of those films that has to be seen. And for some, they just won't get it at all and leave the theater (or television room) scratching there heads in frustration.<br /><br />In short, No Country for Old Men can arguably be added up to a film about a lot of nothing. For me, a film (no matter how great or bad) has some sort of meaning to its making, some sort of theme that drives it along. But as the credits begin to role and your sitting in your seat wonder 'so what exactly was that all about?', it just seems sort of like a waste of time. For the critics and all those who love this film, thats good for you and obviously you all see something that I'm not seeing. Cause all I see is a film of pointless violence, pointless talk, pointless scenes, and basically a handful of pretty 'decent' moments and great acting, all of which add up to...nothing.<br /><br />I guess I'll have to see what next years Best Picture winner has to offer. Who know's, maybe
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	Remember this is a DVD review not a movie review. This DVD gets a 0. Why? It is the typical bare bones release of a great movie. People will buy it, but will soon realize that the DVD is horrid and has no special features at all. Then a few months later another one will be released. Typical hollywood and thier double dipping. Do not buy this version. Wait untill the special edition. You know it is coming.<br /><br />Hope everyone reads this.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I really did enjoy this movie and Charlize Theron can do ugly evil real good; she is one amazing talent. The movie has some great special effects and it brings you right into it, which I loved. Kristen Stewart is not strong in this movie which I was hoping she would be; she still needs to grow as an actor and stop playing herself in all these movies. I don't see the character I see her as herself, but beside that it was fun watching this movie. I don't like to give to much away, but I have to say Ian McShane, Toby Jones along with a few other greats lost a few inches for this movie. Enjoy, you'll be surprised, the movie was well done.
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	"Truly, my fellow movie enthusiast, this movie was a miserable disappointment.<br /><br />I honestly didn't have sky high expectations for this movie, so it wasn't a case of having them being too high to possibly be met (as can often be the case for fantasy/epic/action movies).  The first 20 minutes or so were compelling--I was intrigued, as were the people that were watching it with me [Note, I have only good things to say about the streaming quality--as always with Amazon it's great].<br /><br />After the first 20 minutes it just seems like the story collapsed on itself under the weight of trying to ""reimagine"" the Snow White story.  There was very little meaningful chemistry between the actors, and after a while, the CG looked like it would have been decent for a mid-90's film.  All in all it ended up being enjoyable, but more because I and my friends were laughing at it.  So, it wasn't a total loss.<br /><br />But, if you are looking for something that is epic and compelling, I highly recommend you go look elsewhere"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	One of the all time greats! Have watched it many times and still love it!
B001OHS8BQ	2.0	b	I had heard so many good things about this movie. I think it would be a good movie for realationships that are going through a rough spell but we didn't really get anything out of it. After serving over 5 years in Iraq between us, we cherish every moment we have together. But I would recommend it to people going through a rough spell in their realationship. Over all, it was ok
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Food Inc is a must see for every American concerned about food.  The information brought forth has caused my family and I to make some major changes in where we buy our food.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"The Dark Knight wasn't surprising... Everyone KNEW it was going to be AMAZING - and it was just that... AMAZING!<br />...but there were many who doubted that Iron Man would be a good superhero movie.<br />Surprise, surprise.<br />It ROCKED!<br /><br />Robert Downy Jr. was P E R F E C T in this role. He WAS Tony Stark.<br />The effects were great.<br />The story was entertaining.<br />It stayed pretty true to the comic book.<br />The supporting cast was wonderful (I really enjoyed Jeff Bridges in his role).<br />The end could have been a little more ""satisfying""...<br />...but overall, it was a very, very entertaining film.<br />Oh, and the line before the credits rolled (I'm pretty sure it was the last line of the movie) was great!<br /><br />I still believe that The Dark Knight was the best summer movie to be released this year, and for that matter, the best superhero movie ever made, but I think Iron Man is right up there with the best.<br /><br />Bottom line: Great movie."

B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	"My husband and I watched the whole first season during a weekend. I was intrigued by the first episode, but then I did start to lose some interest. I pretty much only care about the story line involving Sookie and Bill, although it is a bit irritating how she will be into him, then get pissed off at him, then see eachother and make passionate love, then break up again, over and over. I really don't care at all about the rest of the characters in the show. I don't care for Tara and her attitude. I think the affects of ""V"" is just a bit too corny. The relationships around Tara and Jason Stackhouse take away from the show, in my opinion. Overall, it's just an okay show. I am curious to watch more about Bill and Sookie though, but I'm into the romance stuff. My husband, however, likes the show more than me and cannot wait to see the second season. He thinks it's really fun. Had I seen True Blood before watching the first 2 seasons of Californication, I might have liked it better. But I kept thinking ""Californication is better"""
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	It was good, But I would have prefere it to be lighter in the background of the movie it was dark.there were scritches on the DVD, but didn't seem to interfere with the movie. The rest of the movie was good....
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This is a great way to pick up the copy with BluRay, DVD and digital copy in a single package.  It's a Target Exclusive, so you can find it there, and from 11/06/11 to 11/12/11, it's on-sale for $9.99.  For that price, it's a great pick up, though not from any reseller on Amazon.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I've been a Harry Potter fan for as long as I can remember. This, besides 4, is my favorite movie out of all of them. Definitely get this and part 2 to add to your HP collection!
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	"I went into this movie with no real expectations...I heard it had won awards, but that is all meaningless...a lot of great films don't win any awards and a lot of crap films do...its arbitrary. When I read the back of the cover to see what it was about, it seemed like an interesting idea...done in other movies, but I wanted to see how it was. The movie is 2 hours...the probably first hour and a half I was interested. I had remarked that nothing was really going on, it was slow moving, but I was interested to see what was going to happen next. I have seen other movies where nothing is really going on, and I am bored out of my mind. This one was able to capture my interest. The last half hour was as uninteresting as the first 1.5 was interesting. It does not wrap up with a neat little bow which  is annoying...But it was almost like there was no conclusion. The last scene is with Tommy Lee Jones...he was not even the or one of the main characters in my opinion. It was the guy with the money, and the guy wanting the money. It was as if the cameras picked up part of a big story and never filmed the rest...it just stopped. Also, a lot of the ""stuff"" that happened, they didn't show...instead of showing how someone died, they just made it apparent that he died. The whole point of a movie in my opinion is to show the it...don't let me imagine or whatever...If I was interested in imaging then I would read the book and envision it myself, or just think to myself...mmm, wouldn't that be neat. Aren't we paying the director to do that for us. I found it to be the opposite of the Village...I found that to be boring but gets more credit because the ending comes from out of nowhere. This one was great throughout but ends funky. We have always thought of full metal jacket as 2 movies in one...the beginning with Pyle is great...the second half stinks. I found the same type of thing here.<br />As far as Javier Bardem...his coldness and eyes are freaky...best actor good??? Again, arbitrary. Like Robert Wuhl said about Ben Affleck, even he has an Oscar...a little perspective please."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"I watched this movie a few nights ago with my teenage son and really enjoyed it. Robert Downey Jr plays Tony Spark, the owner of a company which builds weapons. He gets captured in Iraq and a magnet is installed in his chest to prevent him from dying. He uses this magnet in an invention, an ""Iron Man suit"", to excape from his captors who are forcing him to build a weapon for them. When he returns home, he decides to build weapons to help others rather than harm. He continued to work on perfecting his Iron Man suit and the results are really cool.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges is the villain, Gwyneth Paltrow is ok but kind of boring as his assistant, and Terrence Howard, who I really like, plays his part well as the military friend of Iron Man.<br /><br />Great special effects, good plot, cool techonological stuff. And really really cool cars. Good humor too. I love the suits, I love his cars, and I thought it all really well done.<br /><br />We often have a tough time finding suitable family movies without tons of sex and profanity. This was great!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	My husband and I started this workout and it kicks your tail, and more, the first week was hard, but by the second week, your body starts getting used to it somewhat, but you do keep pushing yourself harder and harder, but you see results, which is a huge bonus.  I definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a great workout.  Plus the bonus is, the only equipment that you need is yourself.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Excellent movie for all couples to watch together.  Excellent movie for engaged couples to watch also.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Wonderful movie to watch in 3D in your own livingroom.  The snow that was falling in the movie, looked like it was falling right in my own livingroom.  Awesome colors, and a truly magical way to watch a truly wonderful movie for the holidays.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	The John Adams dvds are absolutely fabulous.  They should really be required viewing in our schools, perhaps high school social studies classes, as they bring American history to life in such an interesting way.  The actors portraying all the historical luminaries, not only John Adams and his wife, but George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, etc., were spot-on.  We also loved the theme music for this show!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Based on the Hong Kong thriller, ""Infernal Affairs"" (2002), Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed"" is a shotgun blast to the pandering cinema that has afflicted the American screen of late.  Scorsese has returned to the urban crime-drama genre that he helped to make famous with ""Mean Streets"" (1973) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990).<br /><br /> Scorsese, a consummate auteur, shares many thematic interests with his screenwriter, William Monahan. A Boston police officer, William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), goes undercover in the local mob with the hope that he may purge himself of his family's criminal history (redemption and honor being major themes in Scorsese's films, such as ""Gangs of New York""). Costigan's job is to provide enough evidence to allow the police to apprehend the head mobster, the lurid and merciless Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Costello has infiltrated the police force with a mole of his own, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who Costello has been grooming since childhood (corruption being another important theme for Scorsese, see ""Goodfellas""). Each of the moles quickly becomes aware of the other's presence, and they both realize that if either is going to survive, he must quickly find his opponent.<br /><br />Monahan lathers his screenplay with the most vulgar language this side of Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction.""  Supporting actors Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, who both play upper level officers, deliver deliciously profane dialogue with side-splitting ease and authority.  Matt Damon infuses the antagonistic Sullivan with poise, sophistication, and charisma.  Leonardo DiCaprio's protagonist is conversely something of a blunt and unstable instrument.  DiCaprio's work recalls that of James Dean, as he plays a frazzled young man waging war with the world and within himself.  Surprisingly, screen legend Jack Nicholson is something of a weak link in the cast.  He uses his trademark mixture of charisma and menace in a familiar and admittedly somewhat goofy portrayal of villainy.<br /><br />The real star of the film is Scorsese.  Taking a cue from an early exchange between Wahlberg's character and Costigan - ""What's the matter don't you know any Shakespeare?"" - Scorsese's presents the film as though it were one of the playwright's tragedies.  Tragic and comedic tones are expertly juxtaposed.  Music, be it classic rock or Howard Shore's score, is ever present.  The Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" is used to great effect during the film's opening.  It acts as a harbinger of things to come.  Violence is explosive and brutal. Michael Ballhaus' lighting is atmospheric and exaggerated.  Note a scene in Sullivan's office where a bizarre light effect casts an X across the wall (Scorsese litters the mise en sc&egrave;ne with X's, both as an homage to Howard Hawks's ""Scarface"" and a visual representation of Sullivan and Cositgan's duality).  Relentless camera movement and Thelma Schoonmaker's jump cuts further give rise to a sense of nerve-jangling tension.<br /><br />Under Scorsese' own admission, ""The Departed"" is his first attempt at a film with a plot.  On paper, the film does indeed represent one of his more traditional, studio-friendly ventures.  He is working with a very bankable cast and a three-act narrative (most of his films have been more concerned with character studies than a archetypal stroyline).  Despite the creative limitations that may be associated with a more commercial project, Scorsese is more than able to elicit his own passions.  ""The Departed"" is a fierce, raucous entertainment that is not to be missed."
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"Wow, sometimes i wonder if theres a secret government conspiracy to give this movie a bad review on Amazon lol. Becouse you know something is up when such a good movie gets such sketchy reviews....its either some people are on crack, or totally dont know how to have a good time at the movies.<br /><br />Did you even watch this film? Please, lay off the heroin, marijuana, crack, meth or whatever mind alter substance youre on. Please. lol<br /><br />This movie is a riot. Plain and simple. Its classic Indiana Jones....with signature touches from both George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, they prove to still be a wonderful team.<br /><br />Theres so much over the top action and adventure that goes on in this film, all i can say that it is great fun. Anyone who loves classic adventure will enjoy this well done addition to the Indian Joins trilogy.<br /><br />At first, i wasnt sure if Harrison Ford could do it, i thought maybe he lost that spark of excitment, humor and charm....but as the movie rolled onward, it just kept warming up and Ford proved that Dr. Jones is back.<br /><br />I think this film was a lot more fun than the previous films that were very dark in ways, but with Crystal Skull, again, is much more fun. Definitely better than Temple Of Doom, in my opinion, and nowhere as dull as Raiders, though thats classic fun.<br /><br />I cant believe that im actually saying this, but i think i might like this installment the most out of the entire series of Indian Jones films.<br />I recommend you watch this on Blu Ray on a big High Def screen with a great sound system. It will keep you watching from start to finish.<br /><br />And trust me, even if you have cheesy setup, you'll have good time, becouse to be honest with you, i watched this film, in its entirety, on a website, and the video quality was very low and the sound was MONO...not even stereo sound.<br /><br />I felt like i was watching a classic adventure movie. The way it was directed, just had a classic style. The acting was good. I loved the beginning....for people that are familiar with George Lucas, or is a fan of his, you'll notice his contributions in this film. And of course, Spielberg has that visionary scope that is so big and memorable, it reminded me of the wonder i found in films like the Goonies and E.T.<br /><br />Lots of scenes in this film are just classic. I cant stop saying how much fun i had watching this film. This is one of those movies where you get all your food, candy, soda and whatever else ready, along with your family, and you just have fun old time. I cant wait to see this again in Higher Definition and on a bigger screen.<br /><br />Shia Lebouf ...if thats how you spell that boys name...does a good job in his role, and i can see him in future Jones movie projects, and even the girl from the original Jones film, the brunette, shes back...its so good to see an original character like that return to the series, and shes funny and full of life in this one.<br /><br />Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull has more fun than any of the past films because it doesnt take it self extremely seriously, it lightens up where it needed to lighten up , but dont you dare think this movie is soft or something, like its for the Disney channel. No way.<br /><br />That trademark graphic grotesque realism is still present in the series....two words....KILLER ANTS. Just look out for that scene! Among others.<br /><br />Now let me mention the music that accompanies us through our adventure....John Williams, the original creator the series original film score , is back and gives the film more of that classic film score, its great, and is a strong addition to the film and makes it even more lovable. I swear, if you need a guy to make a rip roaring adventurous film score that you'll never forget, count on John Williams to get the job done...other films he did the music for are such historical and timeless tunes as that for Star Wars and Superman, not to mention his great work on Shindlers List.<br /> Anyways, the music is great and worth sticking around to listen to even as the credits start to roll up the screen. Its that good.<br /><br />Out of all the Indian Jones film, this also must have the most insane action of them all. Sure, past Indy films had their share of off the wall, ""see it to believe it"" action and special effects, but Crystal Skull takes all to a level never reached in the other films....the events that go on in this movie just leave you saying ""...Wow""<br /><br />This is classic adventure, thanks to George and Steven, who prove they can make a fun film practically the whole family will enjoy...even if there are some freaky moments. LOL<br /><br />I recommend this film to everyone who loved the old Jones movies and love fun adventure films. To everyone else, i suggest you lay off the illegal substances!<br /><br />Theres good classic Jones humor, and great special effects, likable characters, fantastic music, and the story takes us to where no Jones has gone before....come on people....what did you expect from STEVEN SPIELBERG and GEORGE LUCAS?????<br /><br />Some predictable tale about finding another biblical artifact involving the Nazi party ? Thats all been done before....this time, its even more mind blowing. Its naturally where Dr.Jones adventures would of led him next.<br /><br />I cant wait to see what they pull of for Indian Jones 5!"
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is wonderfully funny. Forget makeup, you won't have any left after watching this one!
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This is a great movie! The bonus features are very entertaining. I hope Hollywood makes more movies like this!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This puts it all together and lets you know what is happening to your food.  We will never be able to claim our rights to real food if we do not know how it was stolen from us.  Buy this now.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	I was enthralled with the special effects, the quality of acting.<br />Also, the psychology of narcissism was raw in the portrayal of Theron.<br />I recommend this movie on many different levels.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I wanted to read this for a long time and needed a large block of time to devote to it. It was so worth it, the people from history came to life, you could feel what each character looked like and what he thought - wonderfully written. So worth the time and I was so sorry when it ended.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	I really enjoyed Sin City when I rented it. When I saw the unrated version (which adds just a bit), I knew I had to have it.<br /><br />If you like graphical novels and movies..see, or buy and keep, Sin City...just one great flick!
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	But the ending left me wanting more. Expected more romance too. Otherwise a very enjoyable spin on the well-loved fairy tale. Empowers Snow White and rescinds the label of damsel in distress.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This was a fabulous movie.  If you like the Comic book genre, this is one of the best out there.  Tony Stark was an awesome character.  Robert Downey Junior delivered the character incredibly.  I would definitely see it repeatedly, loved it.<br />But, it really is a shame if you missed the opportunity to see it on the big screen.  It is a great movie theater film.
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	Great program only down side..it is too short, I want more humor, but don't get me wrong it is a good price!
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	I am a huge Harry Potter fan and pre-ordered the single DVD version of the movie. When I realized that there were no extras on it I actually considered buying the 3-disc blu-ray DVD combo pack, but apparently you can't watch the extras on DVD. What's up Warner Bros? Are you not making enough money on the franchise? You need to fix this.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Bought this for my daughter. It arrived exactly on time and in perfect condition. She's in the army and is using this to improve her test score. She loves it.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"My late night movie for last night was ""The Departed"" in which Jack Nicholson was one of the leading roles. A number of people have told me I look like Jack Nicholson so that made it a bit more interesting. His wrinkle lines are a little deeper and his hair is a little thinner than mine and he cuts his mustache/goatee a little differently. I'd judge him to be about 5 years older than me. No, I haven't looked it up. I have a few diagonal wrinkles on my forehead from being a side-sleeper. Jack doesn't, and probably sleeps mostly on his back. Anyway, that's beside the point and I should indicate that it was quite a good movie but seemed rather long and my attention span waxed and waned here and there, and the plot and characters were interwoven to the point that it didn't make for easy viewing. Yaawwwnnnn. I watched it late at night.<br /><br />Nicholson played a gangster and was quite ruthlessly convincing. The movie was centered about the police who were trying to infiltrate the gang via a few ultra-secret undercover agents but the gang had also infiltrated the police and even the FBI so everyone had to be extremely careful about what they said or who they said it to and it provided a tense environment in which to function. It was a violent movie with a lot of blood and gore. Bullets were flying and a lot of people bit the dust. I noticed that this was yet another one of those ultra-realistic movies where you can see the puff-spray of blood after a bullet strikes a body, or particularly the head. The language was course and crude and heavily into the F-speech dialog of American English to a point I think it distracted from the quality of the movie. The acting and directing was quite good and the story moved along at a comfortable speed. Romantic aspects of the story were trimmed down to the barest minimum. I'd judge it as an excellent film from a director well known for excellent films, but I don't think this is his best.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This is the first time that I have paid for shipping but I guess it was worth it. I ordered this Dec 20 and it arrived BEFORE Christmas. My nieces in Indiana says its the best HP yet!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I was engaged when this movie came out. My ex-fiancee and I broke up while this movie was in theater. She encourage me to go watch this movies so many times but something kept us from watching it and things got ugly between us. We ended up breaking up shortly afterward but I think if we both were to committed to seeing this movie then our relationship would have been saved and we would be married by now.<br /><br />I give this movie a five star and I rarely write reviews on here but this movie is something that is worth my time to write a review. If you are about to get married and you believe in God even if you believe a little bit, I high recommend you see this with your love one. Heck, you should go see this if you don't really believe. I think this movie have changed most people views on marriage.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	We love, love, love the movie and the price we received from Amazon....Thank you!!
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	This is another well acted, well-done installation in the saga of Harry Potter.  The actors who portray the new characters of Luna Lovegood and Professor Umbridge hit Rowlings' characterization of them both dead-on and they are both terrific.  One thing I am really missing in the movie versions of episodes 3, 4 and now 5 is the John Williams scoring and theme music I so loved in the first 2 movies.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	I wanted to like this film, i really did. But it just reaked of some lame video game storyline all linked together. It is true to the source material but when adapting a comic to another formal you need to adjust it to that format. This has not been done here. In essence you get a moving graphic novel. If this was to be adapted to a novelisation would the source material be used so literally. I think not. This film was all style over substance. Bad story, lame characters, lame action. It gets one star for Rutger Heurs great performace.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	This last year has been a major disappointment for science fiction but there seems to be a veritable glut on superheroes going on now, so I waited to buy Iron Man after I bought The Dark Knight and Hancock, and I can't wait to see Watchmen when that comes to DVD.<br /><br />Iron Man turned out to be much better than I expected given Marvel's past failures like Daredevil, The Punisher, and as far as I'm concerned, The Hulk. For an origin story, it is well written save for a plot hole or two and very well acted & directed. From beginning to the end credits (and you really have got to wait til the end of the credits or you miss the zinger) this is a really good movie. Not great, but really good. As for the DVD, that's another matter. I was hoping this movie would come in fullscreen like The Dark Knight, The fantastic Four, and other movies where you either bought it fullscreen or as in some cases, you got a disc with widescreen on one side and fullscreen on the other.<br /><br />Too much of the good stuff gets cut out with widescreen, And I don't know why these companies assume that everyone can afford-- or will even buy a wide screen TV if they could afford it-- and so make movies in only one limited format. Iron Man is already in Blu Ray, so why not fullscreen as well? Then you would have a five star DVD to watch!
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"Tony Stark is a proud product of the military/industrial complex, a technological boy wonder who has risen to become CEO of the world's premier weapons-manufacturing firm, Stark Industries (started by his dad, who met an untimely end at an early age).  A world-renowned bon vivant and jet-setting playboy, Stark comes replete with a jumbo-sized ego and a cynical quip for every occasion.  He is also utterly indifferent to the fate of all those innocent civilians around the world who have fallen victim to his weapons (he doesn't mind being referred to as a ""merchant of death,"" but he balks at being called ""the Da Vinci of our time"").  Yet, after he's kidnapped by a band of terrorist rebels in Afghanistan, Stark finally gets the chance to experience life at the other end of his death-dealing product. After a hairsbreadth escape from his captors, Stark returns to the States a radically changed man - not only newly cognizant of the harms he's caused over the years, but transformed into a superhero via an indestructible suit of armor he was able to design and manufacture while in captivity.  Stark now plans on using his technological prowess for good rather than evil, protecting the innocent and pulverizing the bad guys.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" soars into the top echelon of superhero movies thanks to a witty screenplay (by no fewer than four writers), fast-paced direction by Jon Favreau and top-notch special effects by a veritable army of CGI wizards.  But the real secret of the movie's success lies in the brilliant, multi-layered performance by the great Robert Downey, Jr., that, if there's any justice at all in Hollywood, will garner him a Best Actor nomination come Oscar time.  He is the true heart-and-soul of this movie, and no amount of money lavished on the technical aspects of the production could have made ""Iron Man"" what it is without him.  Gwyneth Paltrow has rarely been more appealing and less mannered than she is as Pepper Potts, Stark's loyal Girl Friday who becomes the better half of one of the sweetest romantic couples in recent memory.  These two fine actors create a wonderful chemistry together that once again proves that less is definitely more when it comes to generating genuine romantic sparks on screen.  James Bridges and Terrance Howard are also excellent in key supporting roles.<br /><br />Unlike in so many multi-million dollar, effects-driven extravaganzas, the action scenes in ""Iron Man"" - as pulse-pounding and jaw dropping as they are - never come to dominate the movie.  It is the characters and their interactions with one another that provide the real fun of the film.  And that - as we keep saying over and over again, much to our hoarseness - is as it should be.  It's nice to see that somebody finally got it right."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"This is one of the entertaining videos I have ever watched. Well worth the ""price of admission"". Several different characters and lots of laughs."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"I am a big Marvel Comics fan, always have been, but I shall be amongst the first to throw stones at Marvel and Hollywood for the way they've treated so many of me childhood heroes on the silver screen. ""Spiderman"" was fine, but all the rest of the lot were... well, less than good.<br /><br />Then comes ""Iron Man"". I was expecting ""Fantastic Dare-Hulk 7"" but what I got was something different entirely. It was really good.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is well casted, well played, and indeed, well made. The action sequences doesn't steal the picture absolutely, as have been the case with earlier superhero films; nor does the film lack character development. The humour works, for a change, and although this film absolutely is sci-fi d'or, it somehow doesn't seem that far fetched. It is made believable, or at least acceptable.<br /><br />Some critics will probably say it is not fast paced enough, but not I. I think they made it just right with this one, and I'm genuinely looking forward to the next installment (if one is on the way, of course).<br /><br />Highly recommendable."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"I laughed until I cried watching this DVD. Dunham and his characters are quite a team-each with their own unique ""style,"" and sense of humor. My favorite was Walter-he just kinds of says things most of us want to say but don't dare.<br /><br />A few years ago I saw Jeff perform in Branson, Missouri. I had never heard of him until that time, and thought his live act was hilarious. I've been looking for him ever since, and was glad to find this DVD.<br /><br />This DVD comes highly recommended by me for anyone who just needs a good belly laugh!"
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Violent, dark, gripping and an off-humor tone that is like no other.  `NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN' is indeed a Coen Brothers masterpiece!<br /><br />The film is possibly the most ambitious film from the Award winning filmmakers, Joel and Ethan Coen (""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""Raising Arizona"") based on the 2005 novel by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Cormac McCarthy.  ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four which include ""Best Achievement in Directing"", ""Best Motion Picture of the Year"", ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role"" and ""Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published"".<br /><br />""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" makes its re-appearance on Blu-ray with a new audio track, five hours of bonus footage and a digital copy.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" is featured in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of (2:35:1).  One thing you will notice is how the colors of the rugged outdoors really pops.  The earth tones and its vibrancy during the day, to the dark black and blues during the night.  I saw no major artifacting or high grain during the low light conditions.<br /><br />Also, when you see the characters in High Definition, you see the wrinkles, the pores...very detailed picture quality.  Even the people who were shot and killed, good amount of detail in the bullet wounds and showcasing how much detail the crew went into making sure the these wounds look realistic.  There is no denying that the picture quality for ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" is amazing and right up there with the top tier titles.  The backgrounds of Southwest Texas, the multiple colors that showcase the vibrancy of the film, to the dark scenes that exhibit no problems and of course the overall details that you just never think of, are seen quite clearly on this title.<br /><br />Director of Photography Roger Deakins (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Fargo"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"") continues to be one of the top DP's in the industry and was definitey deserving of an Academy Award nomination for his awesome cinematography.<br /><br />As for audio, this is where ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" takes a big step up to perfection.  Buena Vista Home Entertainment made sure the new soundtrack for this second version release utilized an English 5.1 DTS-HD (48 kHz/24-bit) track over the PCM version.  And boy, does it make a difference.  If you thought the gun shots as the bullets hiss, the rifle shots, a dogs being shot, vehicles moving, those action scenes alone sound clearer and punchier than the previous PCM track.  The dialogue is clear and there is just a sense of more clearer sound than the PCM track.  Quite frankly, this is the best audio treatment of the film and the last one was magnificent but for this 2-Disc Collector's Edition, audio is excellent!<br /><br />And again, the film was definitely deserving for its Academy Award nominations for its achievements in Sound and Sound Editing.  The crew did a wonderful job!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />This second version Blu-ray release of ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" is packed with special features.  From December 2007 to February 2008, television, live, online and radio interviews are presented on disc.  So, the hardcore filmmaker or the fans of the film definitely have plenty of content to watch and listen to.  As mentioned earlier in the review, this 2-Disc Collector's Edition comes with a new audio track, a digital copy of the film and five hours of special features.  Included are:<br /><br />  * The Making Of No Country For Old Men - (24:29) A behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to create a Coen Brothers' movie.  Featuring interviews with the Coen Brothers, cast and crew.  Included on the last Blu-ray but nevertheless, very informative and entertaining to watch.  Also, how certain cast members were selected.  Surprising especially when you find out that Kelly Macdonald (Carla Jean) is from Scotland and has a strong, thick accent but played the character of a girl with a Southern drawl quite well!<br />  * Working with the Coens - (8:07) The cast and crew of No Country for Old Men talk about working with the legendary duo.  It's great to hear the cast and crew talk about working with the brothers and talk about how they want a certain scene a certain way.  Fun featurette that was included on the last Blu-ray.<br />  * The Diary of A Country Sheriff - (6 min.) A look at the relationship between Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh and Josh Brolin's Llewelyn Moss through the eyes of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones).  A good explanation of how this proud Sheriff who is about to retire notices that he probably is in no league to take on the crimes of today and the types of killers out there.  The days of being a sheriff with no weapons are a thing of the past.<br />  * Josh Brolin Unauthorized - (9 min.) An interesting perspective of ""behind-the-scenes"" as Josh Brolin interviews certain cast members and the crew.  A dramatic ""behind-the-scenes"" featuring the cast members with some sort of an edge.

The film has its many layers but I think that Javier Bardem's excellent portrayal of the psychopath Anton Chigurh is going to ruffle some feathers because of his overall look, his demeanor and his eyes of the thrill of a kill, you can't help but think how twisted this character is and for certain characters, who encounter Chigurh, you are at the edge of your seat as he wants to determine the fate if they live or die.  It's twisted and his means of killing and the barrage of violence is not going to make the squeamish any happier.<br /><br />This is possible the Coen Brothers darkest film.  Granted ""Fargo"" was a dark film but ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" is well-written, well-acted, well-filmed...it's the Coen Brothers masterpiece extravaganza.  Dark humor, violence galore but a well-told plot and characters that you want to watch.<br /><br />For me, the violence was excessive but it was needed.  It was very important to show Chigurh as this psychopath and the level of detail that went into showing those bloody scenes was well done by the crew.<br /><br />As the Coen Brothers and Javier Bardem did a wonderful job, you also have to give the thumbs up to the other talent.<br /><br />Josh Brolin being denied an Academy Award nomination was a bit of a shock.  Where many people have not been fortunate to get away from Chigurh, the character of Llewelyn Moss was a constant challenge but you actually felt yourself rooting for Moss for a little while.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell was portrayed very well.  A World War II Vet and proud Sheriff who is now having to deal with drug deals and mafia style killings, he's not prepared to take on these type of people.  This is not the same country he lived in before, it's become dangerous and hence the title ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"".<br /><br />I will have to say the shining star was Kelly MacDonald as Carla Jean.  At first, you think that the woman is the token broad at the beginning of the film but her final scenes perhaps is a scene that has left many people wondering what happened to her character.  It's because her character was able to do something that many of the other characters have not and thus, comes away being someone special.  And I also have to say that I was shocked to find out that Macdonald was Scottish and had this thick accent and to hear hear playing a woman with this Southern drawl was amazing.  Well done!<br /><br />Many people who purchased the first Blu-ray disc may be asking themselves, is this second collector's edition worth it?  Absolutely yes!  The new DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack is just amazing.  Combine that with already the perfect video, video and audio are just perfect.  The special features also gets a 5 with five hours of interview footage and in depth knowledge behind what the Coen Brothers wanted to accomplish in the film, to hear the talents (with the exception of Tommy Lee Jones) really show their passion towards this film and just very good insight of the making of the film.<br /><br />So, as much as I hate re-releases especially if they are not long after the previous was released, in this case, I have to say that the release of ""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN"" was warranted.  For such an incredible and magnificent film, it deserved special treatment and now it does.<br /><br />""NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN - 2-DISC COLLECTOR'S EDITION"" receives an A+ and is highly recommended!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I'm officially obsessed! One of the best at home workouts out there. If you workout from home a lot like I do (the Firm, the Jillian, etc) then this is the next step for you when all of those DVDs are getting way too easy.
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	Walter, the old codger, is one of Jeff Dunham's buddies/dolls in the show. I love his facial expressions and gestures more than any of the others. I can almost forget he's just a doll, he's so accurately real for an old codger. He is definitely politically incorrect in the funniest way. I love Walter and he gave me several chuckles in this show, particularly with the improv stuff he does with the audience.<br /><br />I also like Jose. Sure, he's a bit 'stereotypical', but then again, I think that's the point of him too. When Jeff Dunham gets to going with two, three or four of the dolls at once, it is quite impressive... on a steeeeeek.<br /><br />Peanut is okay. He's funny, but he's a bit odd. I like Bubba J. But Sweet Daddy doesn't do it for me. I didn't mind the standup routine with Sweet Daddy, but I really disliked the commentary in the green room and the 'pimping' with the girls and stuff that wasn't part of the stage show. It wasn't really necessary and it wasn't really all that funny either. It was definitely racist and overtly stereotypical of a very negative type.<br /><br />I would have given the show a five if it had made me laugh out loud a bit more and if Sweet Daddy wasn't part of the act. Even with these things, Dunham is talented and he has a good show. He uses a little bit of crude language, but it's not really excessive, and there are some sexual innuendo, but nothing super graphic. It's mostly a humorous, clean show, with just enough edge to be 'adult' or 'grown up'. Dunham is expert at making you forget he's a ventriloquist and the cameras get good angles on the dolls to make them seem more realistic.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good way to spend an evening chuckling at some silly jokes and enjoying Dunham's talent. I will definitely recommend it and will watch other Dunham shows.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	When I first watched this movie back when it came out on DVD, I didn't fully understand it because there is a lot happening, so you have to pay attention, but anyways, even though I didn't fully understand it, I enjoyed it none-the-less, and it was worth my time to watch it again to see if I could figure out what I missed the first time, and I sure did, so ever since the second time watching it, it has become one of my favorites by Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />Now like I said it can get very confusing, because there is a lot of names and double crossing, but once you figure it out, you will love this film, it has everything you'd want in a mob/scorsese film, excellent and well thought out plot, terrific performances (Leonardo Dicaprio has really become a great actor), and Matt Damon, Mark Whalberg, Jack Nicholson, and Martin Sheen all deliver performances you would expect from them.<br /><br />Let's just say this, I watched the movie again for the first time in about 2 years the other day, and I watched it again that same night, and I'm going to watch it again tonight, you really get drawn into the characters, because it's really a character driven movie.<br /><br />Now I have not seen Infernal Affairs, but if this movie was influenced by it, I'm sure it's really good, so I will have to check it out, I'm sure it's not easy taking a Chinese movie and converting it for an american audience, and like I said, although I have not seen Infernal Affairs, and I cannot make a valid comparison, they did a hell of a job in my book.<br /><br />Another thing I must give a shoutout to is this films soundtrack, every song fits perfectly in every scene, the only song that is meh is Roger Waters cover of 'Comfortably Numb' great song yes, but the original is far surperior, but I can deal with that.<br /><br />So in one word, this is a fantastic modern mob movie, I usually go for the classics myself, but you can set aside a few more modern movies for me, and this is at the top!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Robert Downey Jr. brings the Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man to life in this thrilling movie.<br /><br />Downey stars as Tony Stark, billionaire head of Stark Enterprises.  Taking control of the company after his father's death, Tony, along with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) continue to manufacture different types of military weapons systems.  Their newest system is the Jericho missile, and Tony is on a mission to Afghanistan to show off the system to the military brass.<br /><br />After the demonstration, Tony hops in a Humvee.  He's talking with the others in the Humvee when suddenly, the convoy comes under fire.  Tony is eventually captured by rebels and hidden away.  He is told that, in order to be released, he must build a Jericho system for the reigning warlord.  However, Tony has something else in mind.  He instead begins construction of an iron suit.  Once completed, Tony blasts his way out of captivity.  He's finally rescued, but he's forced to leave his damaged suit behind.<br /><br />Upon returning to the U.S., Tony decides to stop all production of military weapons, much to the amazement of his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Obadiah.  Instead, Tony works on perfecting his Iron Man suit.  He even returns to the Middle East to clean up some unfinished business.  Meanwhile, Tony's company has suffered huge monetary losses due to his decision to stop military production.  As it turns out, Obadiah has had secret dealings with the Middle Easterners and is still trying to funnel arms to them.<br /><br />In the end, Tony discovers that Obadiah has betrayed him and has managed to build his own suit.  There is a huge confrontation between Tony and Obadiah, and only one will survive.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges all give first-rate performances.  The special effects are great, and there's even a little comedy thrown in, too.  I've seen each of the ""Spiderman"" and ""Batman"" movies, and I'd rate ""Iron Man"" as the best of the superhero films.  Highly recommended."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	OMG!!!<br />I LOVE this show!!! Blood,Sex,Humor, an actual vampire story line!!! I'm not a freak and dress in black but I'm a mild vamp fan. my favorite movie is the lost boys and like Anne Rice. This show is my new favorite and I'm counting down the days until this comes out on video so I can re watch them. If your NOT into vamps its ok because this show is still entertaining to anyone guaranteed! just found out that there are books and I'm all over it. Oh and did I mention I LOVE the show?
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	I do thoroughly enjoy the Harry Potter movies, including this one.  However, the books are better in each case, at least for me.  Nonetheless, this movie, as well as the others, will be viewed over and over by me and my family.  Much fun and can't wait for the new one due out this month.  And, yes, I'll buy it (at Amazon) and add it to my collection.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	This is a re-make of a Chinese multi part movie, although they forced everything into 1 move ( whereas the Asian original was several parts ) I thought this movie was still pretty good. With the HD the movie just looks that much better, the clarity in each scene is amazing.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"Ah, the joys of having a theater right across the street.  Tonight, after work, we decided to check out Sin City, as we've been wanting to see it for quite a while.  So, on opening night of the new theater, we tromped on over, gave them our pre-paid passes and sat down in the theater.  After numerous commercials and numerous trailers (boo to the commercials!), the first scene came on.  A little over two hours later, we came out of the theater entertained, though slightly disappointed by the whole thing.<br /><br />Sin City is based on a series of graphic novels by Frank Miller, and it looks like it.  As numerous articles have stated, the movie looks like it took panels straight out of the comics.  Three storylines are used, beginning with Bruce Willis trying to track down a child molester on his last day on the job.  We then get Mickey Rourke playing Marv, a disfigured man who finally finds a woman who is nice to him, getting framed for the murder of a prostitute.  Finally, Clive Owen gets involved with the wrong woman, which could bring the end of the truce between the prostitutes that run Old Town and the police.  We then go back to Willis' story to finish the film, as the girl he saved is all grown up and carrying a torch for him, even as others are after her.<br /><br />Sin City is told in a noir style, with voice-overs throughout the entire movie.  It became slightly weird when some of Owen's voice-overs actually came directly out of his mouth, but then again this is in a scene where he's talking to a dead guy (and the dead guy is talking back), so perhaps it's excusable.  Some of the dialogue in these voice-overs (as well as dialogue between the characters) is overdone, sounding wooden and relying on the actors to make it even remotely believable.  A lot of Mickey Rourke's dialogue is like this, and he's not as successful in making it palatable as Owen is.  Other dialogue, however, fits the style perfectly, and while it's not Shakespeare, it's not meant to be.  The successful lines are those that the actors take just this side of serious, but still have some fun with it.<br /><br />Sadly, Brittany Murphy is not one who can do that.  Her acting is horrible in this movie, her breathy delivery of the noir dialogue reinforcing how corny it really is.  She tries really hard to be the femme fatale, but she fails miserably.  She has one long scene with Owen and Benicio Del Toro, and they both run her over with their talent.  When she finally leaves the screen, I breathed a sigh of relief.  It helps that Owen's segment was the best of the three and he gets to interact with Rosario Dawson and the rest of the prostitutes.  I was quickly able to forget Murphy and move on.  Jessica Alba as Nancy, the grown-up version of the girl Willis rescues, is ok but not wonderful.  Thankfully, that applies to most of the rest, too.<br /><br />Standouts do include Owen and Del Toro (who has some hilarious scenes after a certain event happens), Willis doing a good job of playing the ""hard as nails with a heart of gold"" role that he often plays, and Michael Madsen as Willis' partner.  Madsen has one of the toughest jobs, as his dialogue is some of the worst, but he does a good job overcoming it.  Maybe he's used to bad dialogue by now, given the movies he's been in.  Rosario Dawson also does a good job with what she has, though her final scene is a bit overplayed.<br /><br />The violence is quite graphic, with red blood being enhanced by the black and white photography.  Even when you don't see the bullet enter the head, you often see the blood splatter on the person doing the killing.  If violence makes you squeamish, this is not the movie for you.  For some reason, the movie seems to have a crotch fetish, as quite a few characters are shot or otherwise stabbed in the nether regions.  This all was quite shocking at first (and I was *ready* for the violence, so it's not like it was a surprise), but I quickly got used to it.  Mickey Rourke's story is probably the most violent, as there are close gunshots, blood flying from punches, beheadings, cannibalism, and an axe being applied to almost every part of the human body.  Once that story is over, it's toned down a bit.  Of course, that's like saying a category 4 hurricane is toned down from a category 5, so don't get the wrong impression.<br /><br />Is the movie good?  Is it worth seeing?  I can tell you that I enjoyed it.  The violence is very stylized and well-choreographed.  The stories are interesting and the characters, while often over the top, are still engaging.  The acting fits the story for the most part, with the exception of Murphy.  Some of the characters weave through the various storylines, making cameos in the ones that don't directly involve them and giving the movie something to tie all of the stories together.  I liked how Willis' story framed the other two, giving us both the beginning and end of the movie.<br /><br />Finally, I didn't mind the grimness.  And this movie *is* grim.  Not only is it violent, but don't expect the usual ending to any of the stories.  A lot of people who like violent movies go to enjoy the mindless action, thinking ""ooooooo cool explosions"" and letting it wash over them.  It can be a fun way to watch some brainless eye candy.  Don't go to this film expecting the same.  It is not fun.  There are a few funny moments, some witticisms by some of the characters, but this isn't your normal action movie.  It can bring you down if you're not careful.  Still, if you like this sort of thing, Sin City is a wonderful example of the genre."
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	This was hard to find but Amazon came through with a new copy. I bought this for my mother(77), after showing her Spark of Insanity. This Dvd is prime Dunham without the gimicks of later ones.( the toyota prius advertisment and the overdone Achmed in a santa hat)<br />Walter is at his best, Bubba rocks, and peanut is off the charts.This is a must see.<br />Jeff Dunham is a master of The suspension of disbelief.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Let me just keep this short and simple. I love this show! I think it's beyond amazing!! If you like Supernatural shows and 3 hot guys and some pretty girls too, this is the show for you. Oh and of course you have to like vampires. ;) If you like any of the things I listed, this is the show for you!
B00447G29S	1.0	b	"After getting a Sony PS3 for watching Blu Ray movies and getting the 3-D version of ""Journey To The Center Of the Earth"" , I just knew that this one would look awesome in 3-D. Boy was I ever WRONG. This thing is HORRIBLE. Double images and the glasses are terrible.It hurts your eyes to watch it more than about 5 minutes. This movie is not at all like the ""journey....Earth"" Movie. Maybe they will come out with an update or something later that will fix it , but for now ,,,PLEASE don't  waste your money on this piece of crap."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"...particularly by me.  But this is one film that actually manages to live up to everything one might expect from all that that word entails.  This is quite possibly the greatest superhero film ever. At times it leaves you nearly breathless, leaving you just enough to whisper ""bada$z"" in awe of what you just witnessed (a friend of mine actually did this).  The CG effects are wholly indistinguishable from the practical ones, the action comes in somewhat small but memorable doses, and most importantly the story takes it's time developing it's characters and their unique relationships.  And that is where ""Iron Man"" hits it's home run: characters you thoroughly enjoy watching that make the action sequences and special effects just icing on the cake.<br /><br />The movie does not waste time getting you into the good stuff.  The opening sequence does a great job of summing up the audaciousness, charm, and humor of weapons dealer/genius inventor/billionaire Tony Stark just before his caravan is attacked.  The last thing he sees as he dives for cover from the terrorists before blacking out?  An explosive with his company's name on it that sends shrapnel into his chest, setting the story in motion.  Beautiful.  Flashback to some days back and we get a better picture of our hero to be.  And let me tell you, it is good to be Tony Stark.  Robert Downey Jr. is everything you'd hope, bringing the kind of bombastic personality that just can't be portrayed in a comic book to the big screen. The supporting cast is also strong. Gwyneth Paltrow is radiant as Pepper Potts; snippy sometimes, cool and collected most times, and coy and awkward in potentially romantic situations.  Also worthy of note is Jeff Bridges' convincing performance as Stark's business partner Obediah.  The biggest change from the source material (and there are many) was replacing Jarvis the butler with a HERBIE-style (from the FF, not the Love Bug) talking computer.  But with the faithful butler having been done to death in the many Batman films, this change makes a lot of sense.  Also, Stan Lee's cameo is likely to cause outright guffaws, so be careful you don't spray your drink on the people in front of you.<br /><br />As usual, this Marvel superhero flick is peppered with references for comic geeks, lots of character-based humor, and moral arguments and choices.  Setting much of this story in the Middle East highlights the relevance of the story's message of accountability for our actions and our creations (I'm looking at YOU, America!) without being overtly political.  Tony Stark's realization that his works have brought death and destruction to so many and the subsequent hostile takeover attempt on Stark Industries when he attempts to do the right thing make for a great motivation to put on the armor and attempt to undo some of the damage that has been done in his name.  Good stuff.  And while it's no suprise that ""Iron Man"" has plenty of heavy metal in it's soundtrack, I wasn't expecting to hear Mister Stark admonish Miss Potts for turning down his <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000007489"">Suicidal Tendencies</a> jam.  Now THERE'S a superhero I can relate to. So cool.<br /><br />I find sitting through 10 minutes of credits intolerable, so I left the theater before they had finished rolling and apparently missed a scene that I had been hoping for.  Now I regret it.  Don't make the same mistake. That's what I get for not reading any reviews ahead of time (spoilers and all that).  Either way, this is not a film to be missed if you're a fan of superhero flicks, comic books, science fiction, or just entertaining cinema.  This is a film firing on all cylinders and is sure to please all but the most jaded of fans.  It's about time that the Golden Avenger got his big-screen due, but it was worth the wait to see it dome so superbly.  There is a moment where Tony's military buddy James Rhodes watches him fly out of his lab to save the day then looks to the side to see a chrome suit (the War Machine, I presume) and says to himself/us ""next time, baby"".  I wouldn't miss it for the world."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Martin Scorsese has never won an Academy Award.  He has directed ""Mean Streets,"" ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""Gangs of New York,"" and ""The Aviator,"" among others.  He was nominated six times for the Best Director Oscar, yet never managed to snare one.  For his last two nominations, there was a contingent of show-biz folks who felt he was a shoo-in.  His time had come, they figured.  But Scorsese remained a bridesmaid.<br /><br /> In ""The Departed,"" Scorsese's elegant new feature about good guys and bad guys, the director has chosen subject matter that fits him like a glove.  Once again, he returns to the underworld and toys with the complexities of right and wrong in a society in which ""Might Makes Right"" rules and bad and good are painted not in black and white, but in shades of grey.<br /><br /> Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) is a Boston gangster who learned early that you have to take what you want; no one is going to give you a free ride.  He's applied this principle in his day-to-day dealings, terrorizing rival thugs and his own crew.  Despite an ongoing investigation of Costello by the police, they can't seem to get anything solid enough on him to make an arrest.<br /><br /> Having established the criminals, Scorsese switches to a graduating class of police recruits.  Among them is Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) who, as a kid, was taken under the wing of Costello, and Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio), a smart young man trying to escape his family's criminal ties.  Both will figure significantly in the Boston police's plan to infiltrate Costello's inner circle.  Only two men on the force, Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and his tough-talking second-in-command, Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), know who that infiltrator is.<br /><br /> ""The Departed"" has a superb script by William Monahan.  It is riveting, never predictable, and provides solid roles for its four stars.  The dialogue is rough, as are the men -- both cops and mobsters -- who work the mean streets of Boston.  And there is violence -- a lot of it.  When it occurs, it is often shocking with little buildup.  This tends to shake up the viewer and keep him on his toes.<br /><br /> Nicholson is an actor it's always fun to watch, but he can be excessive and allow his trademark quirks to run away with his performance.  In ""The Departed,"" Scorsese keeps Costello in focus, never letting that devilish Jack wink at us.  Nicholson is immersed in his performance.  As an aging gangster, his Costello hasn't lost any of his bravado, his ruthlessness, or his ability to kill.  Nicholson plays Costello with dimension.  He doesn't resemble any crime figure seen on screen before.  His Costello is unique.<br /><br /> Di Caprio turns in his finest performance since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape.""  His Costigan is a deeply conflicted guy, placed in a dangerous situation by higher-ups who have faith in him to accomplish a difficult mission.  He wants to succeed, but his personal safety is compromised with each day, causing him to balance his fear with focus on the job at hand.  Di Caprio brings an intensity to the role that audiences haven't seen in his previous work.  This is surely an Academy Award-worthy performance.<br /><br /> Damon and Wahlberg, both natives of Boston, draw upon their own background to provide characterizations of two very different kinds of men.  Damon's Sullivan is a smart cookie who rises quickly in the ranks of the police department.  He is secretive, authoritative, often arrogant to those under his command, and calculating.  Damon gives Sullivan a preppy edge.  His Sullivan is a man who's gone far and is capable of going even further.  The combination of his intelligence, drive, and cold-heartedness makes him a deadly person.<br /><br />  Wahlberg's Dignam contrasts with the laid-back demeanor of his boss, Capt. Queenan.  He mouths litanies of profanities as fluently as an announcer would do play-by-play for the Red Sox.  He's a cop, but he's never exorcised the tough streets of Boston from his being.  He calls things as he sees them, without tact, political correctness, or artifice.  What you see is what he is.  Wahlberg brightens an already stellar picture by sinking his teeth into this role and running with it.  Like Di Caprio, none of his earlier screen work matches his intensity in ""The Departed.""<br /><br /> The cast is rounded out by Alec Baldwin and Vera Farmiga, who portray a police captain and a police psychiatrist, respectively.<br /><br /> For the last five years, I've been squarely against excessive running times.  Often, such long movies can be trimmed, benefiting the overall film.  Yet directors continue to give us overly long, padded movies that outstay their welcome long before the final credits roll.  ""The Departed"" runs 149 minutes, yet there is never the feeling that any of those minutes is extraneous.  The screenplay is crafted so deftly that every scene, every bit of dialogue, every close-up has a significant role to play.<br /><br /> I've seen many movies in 2006 and ""The Departed"" is easily the best.  No question.  All the elements come together perfectly.  The film's editing is quick and exciting, never sacrificing characterization in the process.  Not since Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" has a director managed to corral such talent in a single film and come up with a winner.<br /><br /> ""The Departed,"" plain and simple, is masterful movie making.  Director Scorsese has assembled a letter-perfect cast in a movie that showcases both that cast and his own ability to fashion intriguing cinema."
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	Excellent show.  There were many additions that were not in the book and some were not necessary.  I guess for a TV show they needed to embellish but I found Tara distracting and did not like the change in Sookie's brother but on the whole I loved every episode.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"I watched this movie last night on VOD/ cable- twice. I think Ridley Scott is a talented director and I enjoyed Prometheus. (""Alien"" has always been one of my favorite movies.)<br /><br />There are endless reviews of this movie on Amazon, so I'm not going to waste time telling you all about it again. I do have a few thoughts that I would like to share-<br /><br />1) You don't need to see ""Alien"" first, in order for Prometheus to make sense. Why miss out on all the fun? ""Alien"" is an excellent movie and you owe it to yourself to see it.<br />2) There are several disturbing scenes in Prometheus. If ""Alien"" bothered you, then you will not like Prometheus. Even if you have seen ""Alien,"" you should prepare yourself.<br />3) Prometheus deals with DNA, ""The Engineers,"" the creation and destruction of the human race and early stages of alien life/ evolution.<br />4) High tech science fiction - visually stunning - outstanding cinematography. Prometheus is highly organized- put together very well.<br />5) Good acting.<br />6) In my opinion, the music is weak and does not do the movie justice. (The music reminds me of Star Trek with William Shatner.)<br /><br />Regardless of what you might have read or heard, Prometheus is a prequel to Alien, but not directly. (Got questions?) The missing link is on the way- director Ridley Scott has promised a sequel with Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender."
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	"I am immune to the appeal of the Harry Potter phenom. I try to watch the films every now and then to see if I can get a handle on what all the fuss is about. It still eludes me. I was bored through this movie, with one scene standing out as engaging and interesting and having some magic, some sparkle. Obviously, mine is not the majority view.<br /><br />I find Daniel Radcliffe frighteningly cute. He's just a child! Scary. The scene where several Harrys remove their shirts at once - wow. Hand me my fan.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is one of the all-time great film actors. He does evil very well - see ""Schindler's List."" Here he is wearing some kind of CGI no-nose Halloween mask and he doesn't raise so much as one goose pimple. Fiennes could have made this villain, Voldemort, really scary if they had removed the silly make-up/cgi. As it is, you look at him and think, poor guy, some kind of no-nose birth defect. It would be unkind to stare. Hire the differently abled!<br /><br />I had no idea what was going on for most of the movie. I'd read a review saying that Hermione had to erase her family's memories of her, and that that was very poignant. That happens in an opening scene that lasts about a minute. Had I not read the review, I would have had no idea what was happening. Whatever was happening was not poignant to this viewer.<br /><br />I didn't, and still don't, know what a horcrux is. Characters have magical powers, but which characters have which powers? Voldemort wants to kill Harry; Voldemort has magical powers. Why doesn't Voldemort just use his magical powers to kill Harry? What's preventing him? I have no idea, because I don't know how magical powers are apportioned, or resisted, in this world. There's scene after scene of wands and chases and searches and I never knew what anyone could do with what spell or wand, so I didn't know what was at stake and what needed to be done to protect what was at stake. At one point Ron tells Harry ""It's about more than you."" What is it about? Box office revenue.<br /><br />There's a scene where Harry is caught under ice, alone in a forest at night: a real claustrophobe's paranoid nightmare. I found I could watch the scene without any anxiety. Now that's poor filmmaking.<br /><br />There is so much stuff slathered onscreen: eccentric English cottages with floating pears growing outside the front door, magical tents, protective snowy owls, elevators that travel sideways - and I never once said ""Oooo"" or ""Aaaa"" (except for that scene where multiple Harrys bear multiple post-adolescent, nicely muscled, newly hairy chests - ooo baby). Nothing felt magical to me. The ever present onscreen junk all had the same, loud, tacky, K-Mart Christmas feel. ""Less is more"" anyone?<br /><br />There was one scene that worked. I was caught up in it, and, even as I was watching it, I imagined legions of fangirls watching this scene again and again once the home version is released. Harry and Hermione are feeling low. They are alone in a tent in a forest. Music is playing on a staticky radio. The camera focuses on Hermione in the glow of a kerosene lamp. Suddenly, the view of Hermione is blocked by Harry's sweater-clad shoulder. In the same way that he is blocking the scene, he is overwhelming Hermione's consciousness. He extends his hand to her; she rises; they dance, their bodies directed by their despair, their hunger for intimacy with each other, and their fear that satisfying that desire is not a wise idea. It's a truly magical scene, and all too brief. And it required no special effects, just young people you care about who are trying to thrive, as all of us do, through contact, music, art, and dance, in a life-or-death situation."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller's Sin City is film noir for the 21st century. The type of film noir that movie audiences have never seen. It's Mickey Spillane and Raymond Chandler for a new generation. Unlike the writings of Spillane and Chandler, Miller's world features no heroes. Everyone is a villain in Sin City. As we know, however, villains can be good and heroes can be bad. The thin line between the two is at the heart of Sin City.<br /><br />Brilliantly written by Frank Miller and brilliantly directed by Miller and Robert Rodriguez, Sin City is simply one of the most exciting, invigorating films I've ever had the pleasure to see. Movies like this are exactly why I love movies. Sin City is the cinematic art form at its peak. It's bold, passionate, imaginative, striking and uncompromising; things that 90 percent of movies today are not.<br /><br />Squeamish audiences will not be amused, however and that is to be expected. Sin City is quite an extreme film that features tons of extreme violence the likes of which is rarely seen in a Hollywood movie. Because of that, it is sure to be the subject of controversy. However if you can stomach the violence, Sin City will be a unforgettable movie going experience. Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez have created a world never before seen in the movies. A world that exists nowhere in reality except on the page and on the movie screen. The film must be separated from reality.  Sin City is at no time and in no way realistic, nor is it supposed to be. It's a world where the writer's imagination is the only limit. Fans of film in general and film noir in particular, fans of comics, and fans of pulp crime stories will find much to love in Sin City. I, for one, already consider this gruesome little film among my all-time favorites.<br /><br />I will not talk about the stories or the actors, save that Mickey Rourke delivers an awesome, Oscar-worthy performance. I will only say two more words: see it.
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	"I Like Martin Scorcese as well as anyone, but The Departed is far from his best.  This movie had the potential to be really promising, a great premise, an awesome cast, and a fantastic director, but none of it lived up to it's potential.  Please be warned, though, I can't talk about why this movie is as bad as it is without talking about it's end.  I won't tell you exactly how it ends, but some people may feel the way I describe the ending as a spoiler, so if you don't want to risk reading that, don't go any further.<br /><br />The premise is that two kids grow up in Boston and go to the Police Academy.  One of them, Colin Sullivan, played by Matt Damon is befriended at a young age by arch mobster Frank Costello, played Jack Nicholson.  He ends up as Costello's mole in the Police Department, eventually being assigned to the Special Investigation Unit whose main goal is to bring Frank Costello down.  The other kid, William Costigan, played by Leonardo DiCaprio is pulled out of the Police Academy and sent to jail with the purpose of going deep undercover to eventually get close to Costello and gather enough information to bust him.  So Costello's mob and the police both have a mole in each other's operation and, in a way, it becomes both mole's jobs to find themselves or each other, or something like that.<br /><br />Great premise, but except for the very interesting and perhaps even ground breaking use of cell phones in making a thriller, the execution was sadly lacking.  Yes, the first part of the movie covers a lot of ground, and it has to.  But it was still more confusing than it needed to be.  While I enjoyed Decaprio and Damon's performance's, except for the South Boston accents that faded in and out depending on how hard they were concentrating, Nicholson's performance was just too extreme.  Someone seriously needed to slap him and remind him that he wasn't playing the Joker in Batman anymore.  The rest of the cast was pretty good though.<br /><br />Even the soundtrack in this movie was annoying, weird Spanish music when the Joker, er, Jack, er Frank Costello came on screen, and a cover band's version of Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb.""  I don't understand that at all, if you can't get the rights to the original, don't put it in the movie, find something else.  Don't hire a cover band to do the song, at least not a song that well known.  And the Spanish music that came on for the entire first half of the movie whenever Nicholson was on screen.  What's up with that?  I also thought this was an Irish mob, isn't Costello an Italian name, or is the music implying he's Spanish, maybe with a hint of Creole.  Who knows?<br /><br />As bad as this movie was, it was still watchable, until the ending.  This has to be the worst ending of any movie I've ever seen.  The envelope Costigan leaves with the police psychiatrist is never mentioned.  A lawyer you've never heard about supposedly appears from nowhere and hands Costigan a bunch of tapes Costello made incriminating Sullivan.  Another mob mole on the Police Department that you never saw before shows up out of the blue and kills one of the main characters you've just spent the last two hours sympathizing with.  And finally a last mobster kills off another main character, who, get this, really wants to die.  It's almost as if they got to the 2 hour and 15 minutes mark and decided, oops, we got 15 minutes to tie up this film, let's just kill everyone.  It's ridiculous, and totally pointless.  I was enjoying the movie for the most part until the end.  After the ending, I really wished I hadn't wasted my time."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	John Adams should be a required course in our schools.  It gives a wonderful history of how this great country came together and it shows the tremendous sacrifices that were made by our founding fathers. I am sending it to my granddaughters.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Can't get my digital copy since Fox put trojon horse into every single disk. Once it in my computer my Norton 360 stop any disk from the movie! Don't buy it unless you just want to watch it throught your 3d tv. And just happen I don't have it yet. Was trying to watch it throught my 3d monitor and Norton won't let it play!!!!!!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I've seen Jeff a few times before, but his puppet, Achmed the Terrorist, destroys me!  Jeff's an amazingly talented and funny guy, and if you don't laugh, you might just be a dead terrorist, too!<br />Money well spent.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I had seen previews for the show for some time and thought it'd be fun to watch so i tivo'd it. Once Tara went off in the beginning of the first episode, I was instantly hooked. The show is so hilariously raunchy and totally addicting, it's hard not to love it. I couldn't wait until sunday and now i am counting down the weeks until it comes back. i recommend it to everyone!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	OK, I'm 65 and don't believe in Santa or much anything else, but this film is spell binding and sweet.  The 3D effects are remarkable.  Highly recommended!
B002VRZEYM	1.0	b	A friend highly recommended the movie, so it was particularly disappointing.<br /><br />More government regulation of food is what got us to a few companies processing most of our food in a few facilities. Government regulations in the name of safety mean small farms and small processing plants cannot afford the mandated equipment. Big companies can lobby government to get rules written and subsidies for their products. Stop subsidizing corn production and stop diverting corn to make ethanol.<br /><br />If corporate managers and directors at competing companies are not accountable when they have to keep their customers from migrating to non-industrial farming, what makes the film makers or their on-screen speakers think that the USDA can do a better job if there were just more laws?
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	The movie was good....not what I usually watch.  My husband watches movies like this all the time and he LOVED it.  It was a good story line though.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	The Coen brothers make some of the best movies, and this is one of their best. A definite buy.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I love the movie. The blu-ray has the quality of picture it promises. Really enjoy it!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	The beach body site offers an option for $9.99 that if any of the dvd gets damaged they will replace that particular one. I am not sure if amazon offers that feature.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	Harry Potter the greatest.  Great gift and arrived extremely fast just before Xmas!  GREAT
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"I had a love/hate relationship with ""The Departed"".<br /><br />I love Martin Scorcese's work. ""Casino"" is one of my all time favorites, so I went into ""The Departed"" with very high expectations. To be honest, the first hour of the movie was too slow. I understand that Scorcese was establishing his characters and slowly massaging the audience to ""feel"" for each character - but it took too much time. I feel like the first hour could have been condensed into 35 minutes without losing any of the ""flavor"" for the individual characters and their development.<br /><br />The second half of the movie was the part that won Scorcese the best picture Oscar. It was brilliantly conceived, brilliantly acted and kept you glued to the screen. The second half was the payoff for the painfully slow first hour. Each character seems to come alive and you really get the sense firsthand of the tension and drama as it builds through the second half of the movie.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson was great, as usual, but I really think that Leonardo diCaprio was the star of ""The Departed"". He's the guy you latch on to from beginning to bitter end. (By Scorcese's design)<br /><br />All in all, without giving away too many plot points, don't judge this movie by its first half. The second hour of the movie is worth the wait. Scorcese delivers again... although better late than never.<br /><br />4 stars"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Bought this as a gift since we loved our dvd so much, wanted to share the laughter and turn everyone on to this crazy bunch of guys!
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	The latest installment in the popular series, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, is the best entry in the series as of yet. With great special effects, acting and a darker storyline than the previous, Harry's adventures continue at Hogwarts in his fifth year under the watchful eye of evil inquirer, Dolores Umbridge. The climax at the Minstry of Magic is definetly something to see along with Harry's first kiss. Highly recommended!
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"Seriously, thanks god for Robert Downey Jr., the actor was brilliant in the movie, after watching the movie i couldn't imagine any other actor portraying the role of Tony stark, the guys was simply brilliant. Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors who can offer a lot more then he's given chances to prove himself. It's mostly because of his drug and alcohol problems but no one cannot deny that he's an outstanding actor who never acted in big budget movies. Not until now as Iron Man..<br /><br />Jon Favreau was obviously given a lot of money and he invested it wisely and brought Comic successfully back to life. ""Iron Man"" has its holes, like not so convincing start but everything since the time Stark returned from his captivity is good and entertaining story. As I said before Downey Jr. is a thing this movie needs, just like always excellent Jeff Bridges in role of Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />In this cast I didn't like Gwyneth Paltrow. She has some rough moments, and this definitely wasn't her best performance, but she didn't bring down the film by any means. Great supporting turns by Terence Howard as Tony's associate and erstwhile friend and Clark Gregg as a tight-lipped fed make director Jon Favreau's job helming this adaptation a HUGELY better result than the flavorless ""DareDevil"" from 2003.<br /><br />So ""Iron Man"" is good for fun and as blockbuster that would fill cinemas, but for a place in 250 best movies, I think not. This is a satisfying film from at least three levels: for those who love superhero movies, it's great; for those who enjoy a good message movie, it's only BARELY preachy and always able to keep it frenetic and true; and as a summer film, it's large and captivating, never letting the viewer go till the credits (and perhaps even STILL during that)! While I cannot quite go all the way with 5 stars for this film, it's a very strong 4. A strong movie-going experience for most anyone who likes ""Summer"" films."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"The subtitle for this movie was ""No Intelligence Allowed"", and it makes it more than clear that the filmmakers didn't use any while making this trash.<br /><br />I watched this movie a few nights ago, on the basis of hearing both sides of this ""debate"", and what I saw was a fine example of Michael Moore style creative editing, paranoia, and straight up lying.<br /><br />I'd like to start out by saying that Expelled repeatedly mentions the massive amounts of evidence FOR Intelligent Design, and the gaping holes in Darwinian Evolution.  However, there is never a single mention of any specific evidence for Intelligent Design, nor is there any example of any ""holes"" in Evolution.<br /><br />The foundation of the movie is something called ""Irreducible Complexity"".  IC, for those of you who may not know, is the scientifically bankrupt idea that, if you can't understand how something works or came to be, then God did it.  The major problem with this idea is that it doesn't follow any kind of logic at all.<br /><br />The movie also mentions that Intelligent Design is in no way a new name for Creationism, even having the president of the Discovery Institute say as much (so much for unbiased sources).  The Kitzmiller trial already confirmed what any rational person knows however.  ID is just a subversive re-branding of Creationism.  Intelligent Design is just a Trojan Horse of sorts, so that those who wish to destroy secularism (I must remind you that Secularism is one of the main ideas this country was founded upon, and protects tax-payers from having their money used to indoctrinate our children), and have Christianity taught as the one true religion.<br /><br />Yet another lie the movie tries to pass on is the idea that only dirty amoral Atheists (GASP!) accept the fact of Evolution.  This is completely wrong however, and countless priests, bishops, and other deeply religious people fully support Evolution, via something called Theistic Evolution.<br /><br />I could go on and on and completely debunk this movie, but anyone with half a brain has already researched this themselves.  The movie whips the unthinking into a paranoid frenzy over the idea that Big Bad Science is suppressing them and telling them how to think; That it's actively trying to ruin the lives of anyone who disagrees with it.<br /><br />Do the research and see that these filmmakers are deceiving you in order to control you to further their own warped agenda."
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	poor plot pretty good special effects. Theron was pretty good stewart was pretty bad. Would probably skip this one and wait for it to come out on HBO or something
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	I WAS SO RELUCTANT TO BUY THE DVD, AFTER READING ABOUT THE GORE, AND GALLONS OF BLOOD, ETC. I WAS A FOOL-IT IS A GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, WITH BRILLIANT ACTING BY THE ENTIRE CAST, GREAT DIRECTION BY ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ, WITH BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHY UTILIZING COLOR MIXED WITH GREAT BLACK AND WHITE! TALK ABOUT YOUR NOIR FILMS-THIS RANKS ALL THE WAY UP THERE WITH THE BEST. THE DVD IS BARE, EXCEPT FOR THE BRILLIANT, HILARIOUS, SHOCKING FILM, BUT THE MOVIE WAS ALL I NEEDED! THE DTS SOUND WAS REMARKEABLE AS WELL. LOVE IT OR HATE IT, YOU MUST SEE SIN CITY-YOU CANNOT HELP BUT BE ENTHRALLED AND ENTERTAINED FROM BEGINNING TO END.  BRAVO....................
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Every student should see this series before getting out of high school.  It's great history about our founders that most of us DIDN'T get when we were in school.
B0032CNOK6	2.0	b	"After months of interest, I finally got around to watching this documentary. Purporting to investigate the persecution of freedom in the American scientific academy, the documentary represents the worst its genre.<br /><br />I found this film to be a clumsy and manipulative exploration of an interesting topic.<br /><br />Stein prowls the alleyways of academia without distinguishing between instructor ranks and tenure-track ranks. Several of his prominent subjects apparently have credentials, but the viewer is not provided with details. This represents the worst problem with Stein's approach: the lack of context. Large numbers of qualified academics are denied tenure every year, and to assert without question that each of these cases is political demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of the tenure process itself.<br /><br />And in at least one of the cases, the instructor was not on tenure track, making the argument about the connection between academic freedom and her release from the university blurry at best.<br /><br />Stein also points to eugenics as a cause of the Nazi Holocaust (spending no effort to discuss other variables that contributed, such as Hitler's experiences in WWI, the economic forces in modern Europe, the influence of Nietzche on modernity or even Hitler's own religious faith). Stein equates eugenics as a natural outcome of ""Darwinism,"" instead of the narrow movement that it was within the academy. The result is the unsubstantiated claim that ""Darwinism"" directly justifies the Holocaust and will create another such movement in America today if unchecked.<br /><br />I was more amused than offended at the expulsion scene from the Smithsonian. Does any viewer really think that ANY uninvited camera crew WON'T be tossed out of the Smithsonian? They sell prints and videos of their cultural artifacts as a major source of revenue.<br /><br />And then there's Stein's ambush of Richard Dawkins. Having read Dawkins' recent book, ""The God Delusion,"" it is clear to me that Dawkins' views (which I ultimately disagree with personally) are not represented by Stein's interview. Watching Dawkins struggle to make sense of Stein's questions is painful, it does look as if he thought the conversation was geared for another treatment (which supports his widely circulated claims that Stein lied both about the title and the intent of the film when he arranged the interview).<br /><br />All said, it was never clear whether Stein possesses the needed credentials, background or gravitas to make him a good focal point for this needed discussion. Much context about the rancor surrounding these debates is missing, leading the viewer to take on faith that there exists a terrible and arbitrary bias within the academy.<br /><br />Perhaps Stein should limit his cultural authority to his gifts of comedy and financial insight (though did he not also miss the recent crisis on Wall Street? I don't remember any warnings from him to his viewers and readers)."
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I ordered this DVD for my husband who was a Harry Potter fan and he watched it many times before he died. I then gave it to my younger brother for his enjoyment.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Deserves 10 stars.  He's great.  Laughed so much my sides are sore.  If you have had a bad day, put this on, will definately put you in a better mood.<br />When's a third dvd coming out???
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"I was jazzed to begin with that a new science fiction movie was coming available.<br /><br />I am guilty of not researching the movie more thoroughly on the web before renting it.<br /><br />On the face of it, it is not obvious that it is set in the ""Alien"" universe. My first clue was<br />when I saw the hologram saying ""Wayland Creating better worlds"".<br /><br />There were some good special effects, but mostly creepy ones. It was not a bad movie,<br />just a let down that it was going to be horror and not some uplifting plot.<br /><br />I suppose it was worth renting, but I was hoping for something classy like Avatar."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I was surprised, impressed and moved by this magnificent, albeit compressed, account of the lives of our most compelling founding father and mother. While Paul Giamatti, at first blush, did not seem the John Adams type, his generous, authentic performance was over the top. I admire the fact that screenwriters incorporated so much essential information in less than eight hours of running time, and that the drama never flagged for a moment.<br /><br />I must say that this was Laura Linney's film. Her portrayal of Abigail exceeded all my expectations and reminded me how underutilized this splendid actress has been in the US. She brought her role to life with humor, pathos and innuendo. Her dialogues with Jefferson smoked. Her occasional rages at John, for all his absences, were wrenching. And the scene in which she watches her children receive innoculations for smallpox was deeply disturbing. In turn, her struggle to maintain emotional strength as Nabby struggled to survive the illness were unspeakably moving.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the cameos and other principal performances, perhaps the most surprising of which was David Morse as Washington. I'll simply say the casting was dead-on.<br /><br />When I saw Tom Hanks' Playtone logo, I expected quality. What I did not expect is that I would be moved to the marrow. JOHN ADAMS is a must-see for anyone who wants a sense of the human beings who won and secured our country. Even more, it establishes Abigail Adams' position as a founder more significant than half the signers of the Declaration.<br /><br />A beautiful series which deserved all the accolades it received.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	The Village (M. Night Shyamalan, 2004)<br /><br />The first thing that needs to be said about The Village is that it's miles better than Signs. Which wouldn't, actually, have been all that hard. But you know how these things go. It's not Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense, but it'll do for the moment.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie is the casting. Shyamalan has pulled some of the best of the A-list (Shyamalan regular Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody), a former A-lister working his way back up (William Hurt), and a number of underrated who should be on the A-list (Brendan Gleeson, Michael Pitt, Celia Weston, etc.), and topped them all off with Bryce Dallas Howard in her first leading role. Kind of like taking a cast featuring a bunch of veteran actors and then putting Mark Hammill in the lead role.<br /><br />It's not an invalid comparison. Shyamalan often seems to emulate his elders; his Hitchcockian penchant for putting himself in every film has been commented on many thousands of times (here, it's particularly egregiously Hitchcockian), for example. Moreso, however, because Shyamalan, like George Lucas before him, pulls it off. Howard may edge a bit into melodrama a time or two, but for the most part she very much holds her own against the giants around her.<br /><br />None of those are more giant than Brendan Gleeson in the movie's opening scene. One of the best openers in movies in recent years, in fact. Gleeson's performance is so perfect, so understated, that what follows is either the best movie ever or an anticlimax.<br /><br />The Village, unfortunately, is the latter. The story centers around (duh) a village who, according to the schoolteacher (Hurt), have a truce with a race of things that live in the surrounding woods. (No one knows what these things are, but they're large and ugly.) They don't come into the village, and the villagers don't go into the woods. Except that one of the townsmen, Lucius Hunt (Phoenix), has discovered that his mentally challenged friend Noah (Brody) has wandered into the woods without the creatures getting mad, and he thinks he, too, might be able to go through to bring back some of the benefits of late nineteenth century civilization, like new medicines. The creatures, however, are not happy with Lucius' idea...<br /><br />it's a good idea for a story, and the Twilight Zone comparisons are accurate (The Village, like every episode of the original Twilight Zone, deals with the causes and effects of human isolation). Shyamalan also knows when to twist things, and twist them he does; this is just as good a twist as The Sixth Sense had. Where Shyamalan has gone wrong is in his inability to appreciate subtlety any longer; after The Sixth Sense, fans and critics spent weeks arguing over the movie's use of the color red. In The Village, he just spells it all out for you. It'd be pathetic were it not so annoying.<br /><br />The end result: see it, but wait for the DVD. ***
B001684L0A	5.0	b	The was the original brand new video and the shipping was warp speed!<br />Thanks so much!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Genre: Action, Drama, Dark Comedy<br /><br />Genre Grade: A<br /><br />Final Grade: A<br /><br />This was a spectacular movie with great achievements on all levels. Robert Rodriguez hasn't made a movie this good since From Dusk Till Dawn in 1996. However I think he has found an entirely new element and I hope he makes a sequel to this awesome flick soon.<br /><br />I am not even going to comment on the amazing cinematography and style of this film because it's so obvious that it is top-notch. I will comment on the story though - a strong one that molds together to fit into a story that comes together in the end without ever confusing the audience as to what is going on and who is who. The dialogue seemed like it had been written by Tarantino himself, sticking to the classic, bold lines that make you grin and really root for the characters. Even Jessica Alba did a great job in her acting! I do wish Britney Murphy would have been in more of it, she is a great actress and so underrated, in my opinion. Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, and Mickey Rourke all did a great job with their characters as well.<br /><br />Great movie, but definitely one to keep kids away from. It is extremely gruesome (not so bad since it's in black and white) and it steps across new boundaries in mainstream film. Think Silence of the Lambs meets Se7en meets classic crime drama, and you got Sin City. Great movie!!<br /><br />Oh, and I found out which part of the film Tarantino directed. It's about a 3-4 minute sequence and once I found out it was quite obvious that it was Tarantino who had directed it. If ye want to know, ask and it shall be known to ye.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I ordered Iron Man Bluray couple weeks ago, and i saw it couple times already. The video is quite impressive, so its the sound.<br />A fun movie to watch with friends. Extras are good, Gag reel, documentaries, and Robert Downey jr. screen test among other things.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	I rented the movie just for a weekend night with nothing going on. It was probably worth the $3 I paid to rent, but I wouldn't have any desire to see it again. Chris Hemsworth obviously did a fantastic job. Everyone else is so-so. The queen was a little over the top, and everyone bashed on Kristen's performance as Snow White. I honestly did think she was all that bad. Definitely could have had more lines as the lead role, but nothing was bad about her acting. All in all an ok movie with nothing to do. Worth the $3 to rent
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"Despite the fact that there are many, many moments in the movie that will have you saying, ""Yeah, right"", ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is still a fun movie.<br /><br />The action is great and sometimes comical.  The story is solid.  And the cinematography is top notch.<br /><br />True fans of the franchise will enjoy the story, the time period, and the adventure.  The finish is a bit of a suprise, but still works.<br /><br />In truth, it might not be the best in the series, but it sill holds up for fun, action, and adventure."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Funniest comic in a long time watch it a lot seems funnier all the time
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This movie is amazing. I haven't read the book yet but I find the story uplifting. It explores the real meaning of Christmas. It teaches important values that we should remember and treasure. A must see.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This is a movie for the whole family.  You will not want to miss any part of the movie.
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	"This movie apparently isn't for everyone. That's to be expected. I recognize the film's weaknesses, and I generally enjoy far less pedestrian fare. But since it tore up the box office based on word of mouth, let's at least agree that it was a wildly successful endeavor by an independent filmmaker.<br /><br />I enjoy old movies, having been a Turner Classic Movies addict in years past, and I have heard so many people say things like, ""Today's films are so dark... why don't they make them like they used to?"" That's what this film represented to me, and I personally had a great time watching it (so did the rest of the audience at the cinema).<br /><br />That certain people feel so threatened and antagonized by this creampuff of a story is really funny to observe. They're acting like vampires in a sunbeam... which may be a more appropriate analogy than some would like to admit."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"This is a documentary that everyone in America needs to see because food safety is an issue that directly affects us all, no matter who we are or where we live. The film begins with a flyover of the American heartland, zooming out through a painting of a farm house into a stroll down the supermarket aisle, with rows upon rows of products (47,000 in an average supermarket). All neatly packaged and arranged, they present an idyllic image of pastoral life that is completely incongruent with how food is produced today. Narrator, journalist, and UC Berkeley professor Michael Pollan begins, ""the way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000"". Due to technological advances in mass production, mechanization, chemistry, and genetic engineering, the way food is produced now is vastly at odds with the fantasy of an agrarian America from the 30's to 50's that the food industry sells us on. A ""veil"" has been deliberately dropped between us and our food, because if we knew where our food came from, we wouldn't want to eat it anymore.<br /><br />But ignorance is not bliss. It can literally make you sick to your stomach. If the BSE (mad cow's disease) scares and frequent reports of E. coli contamination in everything from hamburger patties to spinach to lettuce to tomatoes in the last several years haven't given you pause about the food you put on your family's dinner table and the trust you place in the companies that supply it, then you definitely need to watch this documentary. Just as recently as November 1 came reports of yet another E. coli breakout (this time from Fairbank Farms, spurring a 500,000+ pound recall, with 2 reported deaths and 11 sick). Anyone who is concerned with the health of his/her family needs to be made aware of the potential risks involved with eating the foods produced by this dangerous system.<br /><br />Food today is less nourishing, less wholesome, and less safe than it was 50 or 60 years ago mainly as a result of large-scale mechanized production and factory-style agricultural practices that sacrifice quality for quantity and focus on making as much food as possible for the lowest cost (more fertilizers, more pesticides, high density feedlots, lower quality feed). We have cheaper, bigger, and faster foods and higher yields than ever before in human history, but such abundance comes at a cost to our health (increase rates of diabetes, obesity, and infection from food-borne pathogens), our land, and the dignity of private farmers and workers. Many of the foods we eat today are dangerously unsafe or unhealthy and this film explores the hidden human, health, and environmental costs of our modern industrial farming system. The topics covered include poultry, pig farming, cattle raising, corn, and being able to patent life (as Monsanto has done with seeds). Cattle, for example, are fed corn (because it is cheap and subsidized by the government), a food their bodies are not designed for, leading to dangerous build up of E. coli in their stomachs. In high density feed lots, they stand knee-deep in their own feces. Feces is everywhere and slaughtered at the rate of several thousands per hour in assembly-line slaughterhouses, it is very easy for the feces to enter the food chain. Ground beef is mixed with beef from thousands of other cows, exponentially increasing the chance of pathogen introduction. If you didn't know from recent news reports of cattle processors using ammonia to kill bacteria, now you do. Do you want to be eating ammonia in your hamburger patty?<br /><br />If you are an educated food consumer, you will already know much of the information presented here from reading the numerous books on the food industry or watching such films as ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYKAU"">Fast Food Nation</a>"" (which Eric Schlosser also produced), ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002OXVBO"">Super Size Me</a>"", or PETA videos on animal abuse. This is an excellent and highly informative documentary that all consumers should watch. If there is one criticism, it's that the film tries to cover too many topics within its 90 minute runtime and sacrifices some depth for the sake of a more encompassing view of the entire food industry. It ends on a positive note, and even puts the oft-maligned Walmart in a good light, showing their buyers as being responsive to the demands of its consumers. The more we know about how our food is made, the more we can start demanding more wholesome, safer foods and changing the way these large multinational corporations operate. With the growth of organics and chains like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, the corporations are listening."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	After the first couple of minutes you forget that Jeff is the only one on stage doing the talking. And when he has a 3 way argument, it only shows how brilliant Jeff really is. I would really like to see him in person.
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	"Before the firing squad takes their position, at least let me tell you what I liked about it, too. I loved the Route 66 scenes and the history lesson this film teaches about the dangerous by-products of consumerism and convenience. So we get somewhere ten minutes faster, big deal. But what do we lose in the process? The Interstate System opened up America, but in the process it closed the door to much Americana.<br /><br />As for Cars, it kick-started a renaissance in Route 66 ""Mother Road"" scholarship, or at the very least an interest in driving to see what's left. Speaking for myself, I have made a point to check out US 40 in Amarillo (72-ounce steak at the Big Texan, anyone?), and have high hopes of getting to Oklahoma and Arizona in the near future. Indeed, John Lasseter's inspiration for the film was his own family's cross-country road trip in 2000.<br /><br />Being equally honest, I didn't care for the racing scenes, even though they were visually impressive. Every Disney film has its villain, but Chuck Hicks was unnecessarily mean with no redeeming qualities. At least Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), despite starting his relationship with Lightning in an adversarial manner, ultimately transforms into a father-son mentor.<br /><br />There's also lots of crashing and aggression on the track, which certainly contributes to the rookie's unhealthy win-at-any-cost mentality, at least until he is forced to spend some down time in Radiator Springs, a la Doc Hollywood. (Did the writers of that film receive any credit for the blatant lift?)<br /><br />And while I like Mater's heart, I am unhappy that he has been fashioned into such a White Trash caricature. He's dumb and dirty and he talks funny. In my opinion, it's not enough to portray him as the tow truck equivalent of the ""whore with a heart of gold."" Overall, I was disappointed at the many simple stereotypes. Even Guido, though cute, is painted as a non-English speaking immigrant, fit only to change tires.<br /><br />This film has its moments. I just don't think the people who embrace the Route 66 legacy are also going to cheer the NASCAR racing, and vice versa. Great music, though.<br /><br />See also:<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312281617"">Route 66: The Mother Road 75th Anniversary Edition</a><br />(by Sheriff!)"

B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	To some the truth hurts, so when the truth is brought forth the people offended by it attack the truth giver and I see many people hated the film because of that.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is an excellent movie about learning how to truly love yourself and others. Christians especially should really enjoy this one.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I was very impressed with this HBO series. I'm a history buff anyway and love anything related to the early history of our Country.  I thought this was a well produced, well thought out miniseries and I would recommend it very highly.  I learned alot about John Adams and his relationship with other founding fathers.  Once you get past the first scene of the movie where you can't really see anything because its filmed in the dark, it improves from that point on.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Being the arthouse cinema fan that I am, over the last 10 or so years I would occasionally watch a Hollywood movie for entertainment, but I gave up any hope of seeing anything truly artistic from that source. It was about time I was chastened for my arrogance, and sure enough, I came across 'No Country for Old Men' a couple of weeks ago. What attracted me was the title lifted from Yeats; I correctly guessed that it must have been the title of the book on which the film was based, but at that stage I had not yet read the book nor was even aware of its existence.<br /><br />What a feast! A violent modern western on the surface; a dark and bitter existential meditation underneath; actors working their socks off; solid direction and camera work; a minimalistic soundtrack that is as un-Hollywoodian as they get; all of this works together and keeps one impressed non-stop.<br /><br />The layered structure of the film is quite ambitious, but thankfully, the directors do not spell things out for the viewer. If anything, certain things were made less obvious than they are in the book, and that enhanced the overall impact. For example, it takes the full length of the film, including the paradoxical ending, to bring the viewer to the realisation that the protagonist of the story is Sheriff Bell - the least likely of the three candidates for that role. This realisation has quite an impact by itself, but it also takes care of the loose ends of the surface plot - not by tying them up in any logical way but by rendering them irrelevant, which is so much better. The film is about the sheriff, and as far as he is concerned, there are no loose ends left: he lost on all counts; the bad guy won. The book is rather more direct about matters like who got the money in the end, and after the film this certainly felt like a weakness: what is the point of trying not to disappoint the readers who do not get the point, if you know what I mean... To be fair, the book is not always direct, but the film is even less so. For instance, McCarthy pointedly avoided describing the deaths of Moss and his wife in gory detail (in sharp contrast to the overall style of the book); the death of the former is even narrated by a third party rather than directly by the author. The film goes further, merely implying both these deaths.<br /><br />The tense scene where Chigurh and the sheriff appear to be standing at the opposite sides of a motel room door is not to be found in the book. There are several ways of interpreting what happened there, and each of the possibilities enriches the story in its own way. My guess is that the two characters are not actually present there at the same time and that when Chigurh calmly observes the flicker of light through the punched-out hole in the lock, this is in fact just an image in Sheriff Bell's mind - a visual manifestation of his fear, which we are given a chance to see as yet another hint at the fact that the sheriff is, after all, the main character of the story. Of course, this cannot be literally the image in his mind because the sheriff does not know what Chigurh looks like - but the viewer does...<br /><br />A few more words about that infamous ending. I always like it when a film ends at an unexpected point, but here this old trick achieves so much more than delivering a parting surprise. Yes, the final sequence comes from the book verbatim, but unlike the book, the film is wide open at that point because of some small changes to the plot, so what the viewer gets is an anticlimax by the action genre standards and a knockout artistically. A character describing his dream is a staple of arthouse cinema, and here we get not one but two dreams, told to us by the downbeat Tommy Lee Jones, alone in the frame, in such a thick Texan accent that I had to rewind and switch on the subtitles. Everything falls into place, except for the things that, as it dawns on us, do not matter. And can there be a better punch line than ""And then I woke up"", followed immediately by the credits?"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This is a great DVD - taught us a lot - our kids found it very interesting.  It has changed our eating habits, even our kids have kept up the changes (been over a year since we watched it).
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	When I first bought this movie, I thought that it would be OK to watch because of the animation. Even though I'm not a real race car fan, I found myself surprisingly involved and enjoying this movie! It's great! Highly recommended. Kids and adults alike can both enjoy.
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was the weakest of the first four films, so I wasn't expecting much from the fifth entry in the series. Therefore HP5 came as a fairly pleasant surprise. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is an acceptable movie adaptation of the darkest book in the series and stands on its own fairly well, too.<br /><br />Some of the important casting was very well done. Sickly-sweet Imelda Staunton does not exactly fit the toadlike description of the book's dictatorial teacher, Dolores Umbridge, but in her own way Staunton is a more than satisfactory nemesis. Fans will love to hate her. Helena Bonham Carter has a brief but crucial role as Bellatrix Lestrange. And Evanna Lynch makes a superbly spacy Luna Lovegood.<br /><br />When adapting a nearly 900-page book (the series' longest) into a barely two-hour movie (the series' shortest to date), a lot of material has to be left out of the final screenplay. In general, director David Yates and writer Michael Goldenberg made some wise decisions in ruthlessly pruning such extraneous events and characters as Quidditch, the children's visit to St. Mungo's Hospital, Dobby, and Luna's family newspaper. The Tonks character's impact was slashed so drastically that she might as well have been left out entirely as well. And Hagrid's tiresome half-brother Grawp could easily have been excluded.<br /><br />The Harry Potter directors have been adequate at directing in the present tense, but where director Mike Newell fell down badly in the fourth movie was in his exclusion of the necessary foreshadowing of certain key future events. For example, he ""treated"" fans to an entirely pointless, made-up dancing lesson conducted by Professor McGonagall (a ridiculously out of character aberration for Maggie Smith's character), but almost entirely left Sirius Black out of the movie. By failing to show Harry's and Sirius's growing importance to each other in the prior movie, Newell made the threat to Sirius in the fifth movie much less weighty.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Yates has not learned from his predecessor's mistake. He entirely writes the Ginny character out of many scenes (in favor of Neville, Fred, and George), and shows Harry developing a rapport with Luna rather than with Ginny. With the next movie in mind, he should have started to develop the Harry/Ginny relationship, as JK Rowling did in the book. And by pruning the important Black family house-cleaning sequence from the fifth movie, Yates has created another awkwardness for himself in the sixth movie.<br /><br />If there is an aspect of the movies that is insulting at times, it is the treatment of the various ethnic minorities. The directors seem unable to see minorities as regular people in contemporary English wizardry whose ancestors happen to come from non-European backgrounds. In the fourth movie, the Patil sisters attended the Yule ball in stereotypical, jarring Indian costume instead of the formal wear that everyone else wore (and that the characters had worn in the books). Similarly here, Mr. Weasley's black co-worker Kingsley Shacklebolt dresses for a rescue mission and then for an average workday in a ludicrously inappropriate parody of what a television version of an African potentate might have worn in 1965. Why can't he just be a black English wizard in ""ordinary"" wizarding robes?<br /><br />If the PG-13 movie falls down at times in the details, its overall tone of darkness does an excellent job of creating a threatening mood. The book's Harry was at times too whiny; the omission of some of Harry's self-pitying rants added to my enjoyment of the story. As usual, the Phelps brothers' portrayal of the Weasley twins provides some comic relief, though I thought that their anti-Umbridge campaign should have been conducted over a longer period of time and should have included some more interesting magic than merely a few fireworks.<br /><br />Yates deserves credit for learning from some of the series' prior mistakes. I hope that in his direction of the sixth movie, he will fully take into account the necessary preparation for the all-important seventh and final film."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Insanity is the perfect name. I needed to get in shape and this product is a wonderful choice. It is a really, really hard workout, but it really, really works!!
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	This movie is so lopsided. You have 2 self-centered characters in the husband and wife. He wants what he wants, she's just as bad. She complains he's not communicating, but neither is she; fixing her own breakfast and leaving him to find his own food, not calling him or being attentive but demanding attention and calls...  Throughout the film you see the husband changing through a last ditch effort to save the marriage, while you see the wife running around without her ring (the husband keeps his on) and accepting the advances of another man, no attempt on her part to save the marriage. Thanks for sending women the message its acceptable to do that. The film SHOULD have ended with the harlot dieing in a fire.
B001KEGR8Y	1.0	b	I tried to get this to work on line. I love Jeff Dunham a friend of mine got me hooked on him.  I laughed so hard its so funny the video I did finally see was a different one.  Forgot the name of it.  My only complaint is that the video wasn't close captioned  or Open captioned or even subtitled :P
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	"I am one of those people who read and loved Charlaine Harris's books before watching the show. After hearing True Blood's rave reviews, I was excited to see it when it came out on DVD. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.<br /><br />Let me start with the positives. The show creators did mostly good casting job. Actors playing Bill, Pam, Arlene, Sam, and even Sookie delivered great performances and looked pretty much like I imagined them. I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite scenes come to life - trips to Fangtasia, Sookie's and Bill's meeting at Merlotte's, etc. Some moments created by writers (for instance, a flashback into Bill's past) were very interesting too.<br /><br />On the other side, it was painful to see what had become of Charlaine's world in this acclaimed TV series. Somehow small Louisiana town of Bon Temps came of as a ""nest"" of sex-crazed low-lives.  Jason instead of a charming womanizer was portrayed as a stupid drug-obsessed man whore, Bill became way too sullen and even violent, Sookie appeared to be a halfwit. I missed chemistry and love between Sookie and Bill. Their relationship unfortunately looked like the one between a fangbanger and a user-vampire. Also, was it necessary to fill the series with so much sex? I am no prude, but I do not think Jason's weekly sexcapades added anything to the story. Made-up side story lines of perpetually whining Tara and male prostitute and drug-dealer Lafayette also only added to the general air of nastiness of the fantasy universe created in the series.<br /><br />In spite of all these negatives, I will still check out season two. Maybe the series will finally take a right direction, lighten up on gratuitous sex and concentrate more on the great material provided by Charlaine Harris."

B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	Basically it's Pulp Fiction without the wholesome family etertainment value.<br /><br />The movie shines in dark wit and uber-violence, but you won't like it if you think much about details like I did. I'm gonna be honest, this movie has fight scenes that are even more exaggerated than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, a movie which this one reminded me off cause the karate chick in old town can fly. Basically all of the 'good' characters can withstand enough punishment to kill an entire infantry division worth of troops. But if you shut down the logic based part of your mind you'll dig it for it's awesome visuals and dark wit.<br /><br />And honestly I just can't dislike a movie with so many boobies in it.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"Having done P90X before, I quickly realized Insanity was NOT for the weak minded or for the lazy. These Insanity workouts are for the physically ready and the mentally strong...no weights necessary, just a willing attitude. Geared towards the fit work out enthusiast, but can be modified to work your way up into keeping up with the Insanity crew. In less than 10 days of working out I started noticing hints of ""6-pack"" abs and wanted to keep pushing myself. The results alone were motivation enough for me to keep working out and become a Team Beachbody Coach (beachbodycoach.com/JSmithNickell). Now, I'm helping and motivating others through this intense workout. You CAN do this too!"
B00447G29S	1.0	b	The animation in this movie is vaguely disturbing.<br /><br />The story of freakish looking children constantly in peril and surrounded by unfriendly, bizarre, nightmarish characters has no payoff after you sit through two uncomfortable hours.<br /><br />There isn't an ounce of warmth or sweetness in this disaster of a movie.  There's a reason it was a total box office flop.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Love this movie! It's fun, with a good moral behind it. Everyone in my family loves it! Worth watching more than once!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	They are right, after watching this I will never look at dinner the same again. Food Inc. does very well to lay out the facts of the corporate takeover of the food industry in the last 50 years. I hope this can inspire more people to grow their own food and shop locally because we all desperately need to make some changes before we loose all control over what we eat.
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	"I love Harry Potter, OK?  So before you freak out, let me get that out of the way.  The book version ""Order of the Phoenix"" was oustanding.  I also think that previous directors have done pretty good to great jobs of translating the books to film (though I must say things went a little downhill once Chris Columbus left.)<br /><br />All that being said, here's the kicker:<br /><br />The movie ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" played like a Cliff's Notes adaptation of the book.<br /><br />It lopped off a lot of the charm and romance and heartfelt pathos of the book--- as well as a lot of the pure creative touches--- in order to get the main arc of the story down.  On top of that, it made ""adaptations"" to the book in order to get the story moving along--- yet all these ""compromises"" were actually worse than what JK Rowling originally wrote!<br /><br />Don't believe me?  Here is only SOME of what is wrong with this movie:<br /><br />--Poor devlopment of the Harry/Cho Chang arc (The kiss is about all you get.  No real feeling behind it at all.  No devlopement of Harry's crush.  No final break up argument on Valentine's Day.)<br />--Making Cho into an evil snitch (which is why she and Harry broke up in the movie.)  In the movie SHE is the one who betrays Harry. Stupid.<br />--No hospital scenes.  No meeting of Neville's parents.<br />--Perfunctory explanation of Grimmaud Place<br />--Perfunctory development of Occlumency<br />--Harry gets to hear the prophecy while standing in the Department of Mysteries rather than later with Dumbledore.  On top of this, he gets to hear the prophecy just by holding it in his hand.  That makes no logical sense at all!<br />--The Department of Mysteries itself is compressed down into one room (the room with the prophecies.)  All the cool rooms (with the blue lights, the 12 doors, the clocks, the brains, and so on) are all just ignored.  Those were such tremendous inventions by JK Rowling--perhaps some of the most creative stuff in all the books-- that I can't believe they just cut them!<br />--The room with the arch is made into a really boring place.<br />--The battle scene is really short and rather stupid.<br />--Snape's memory of being tortured by James Potter and his argument with Lily Potter is compressed into literally a total of 4 seconds of film.  That scence is so PIVOTAL to the rest of the book series that I can't believe they got away with not fully developing the scene.<br /><br />On top of all these plot issues, the WORST part about this movie is that there was really no FEELING in it.  The whole range of emotional arcs that are so well-developed in the book are done absolutely terribly in the movie.  Yeah, Sirius dies.  In the book, it is a devatating moment. In the movie, it's like ""Oh, well.""  Harry, Ron and Hermione don't have many moments together.  There is no laughing in the movie.  There are no lighthearted moments.  Almost every scene except one or two that could have developed the emotional attachment we feel to the characters has been summarily excluded.<br /><br />Like one other reviewer said: The movie is too short, yet it feels too long.<br /><br />That is, sorry to say, a perfect description of a hack job.<br /><br />I am quite disappointed."
B00447G29S	4.0	b	"A young boy who has begun to doubt the existence of Santa Claus is invited to board the Polar Express, a magical train that takes children such as him to the North Pole to see Santa at work with their own eyes.  The power of this film resides in its visuals.  A process called ""performance capture"" was used to wed the performances of real actors to computer simulated characters and environments based on the artwork of children's author Chris Van Allsburg.  There are many magical and innovative sequences, such as the one in which we follow a lost ticket as it flutters through the air, going through a series of adventures of its own before ending up back on the train where it started.  Santa's village, which looks like a deserted Eastern European village, is quite creepy.  Christmas carols echo from loudspeakers, but they always seem to be somewhere off in the distance.<br /><br />Concerning the story, there's not much going on.  The original book is quite slim, so the movie pumps up the story to feature length with lots of action-filled misadventures.  It ends up telling the story of a journey without really having much to say about it.  Furthermore, I'm not a religious person, but even I was struck by the irony of a secular Christmas story being about a crisis of faith.  In addition, this film is really not a musical, so it's quite jarring when the characters break into song at one point.  Having said all that, I feel that the visual style of the film elevates it and grants it a power and resonance that is not present in the script./"
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Fireproof is an amazing, draw you in christian, movie.  It is so very true to life and shows how God places people in our lives for a period of time that we might learn what he wants us to know.  We need more christian movies like this.  This is for all married people as well as those who want to take a real look at marriage OR remarriage.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	I was expecting the same kind of Robert Rodrigues movie such as Desperado and the Spy Kids movies but found that this was not the case.  I have to say that it was very well put together visually and the many stories were scripted well to make the story cohesive.  I liked it very much.  I love all the characters even the Eric Stahl character. It was very good it showed a different side of top notch actors that some avid movie goers have not seen, this was fabulous.  It was well scripted and well directed it was true to the title and the graphic novel.  This was good work Robert and Quentin, but that is to be expected with these two directors, bravo.  I hope to see a sequel with some more on the Josh Hartnett character.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"Bloody, violent, sexual without apologies, ""Sin City"" captures the essence of Frank Miller's comic book. Featuring four stories vaguely connected to each other by the setting and some overlapping characters with the main character being the city itself the film co-directed by writer/artist Miller and Robert Rodriguez (and guest director Quentin Tarentino for one segment), ""Sin City"" has a terrific cast in a modern day film noir classic.<br /><br />Digitally shot, ""Sin City"" features a terrific cast including cameos from Michael Duncan Clarke, Elija Wood, Britney Murphy, Carla Gugino (who lights up every scene she's in)and other distinguished folks giving the film signficant star power.<br /><br />The first disc features the theatrical cut of the film along with two commentary tracks--the first with co-directors Miller & Rodriguez and the second with Rodriguez and guest director Quentin Tarantino. There is also a third alternate audio track recording of the audience at the Austin premiere of the film.<br /><br />The second disc features the film recut with each segment in chronological order. There are also featurettes on how Rodriguez convinced Miller to make the film, the vintage cars used in the film, the segment that Quentin Tarantino shot,""Booze Borads and Guns: The Props of City City"", ""Making the Monsters: Special Effects Make Up"" ""Trench coats and Fishnets: The Costumes of Sin City"" as well as the teaser and theatrical trailer for the film (and an annoying Miramax promo at the beginning of the disc). The disc winds up with ""15 minute Flic School"" , ""Sin City: Live in Concert"", ""10 minute Cooking School"", ""The Long Take"" and an ""All Green Screen Version"". The last featurette shows how the film looked when they were shooting on the set running at ""800 times"" the normal speed accompanied by Rodriguez's score. Since almost the entire film was shot without any sets, it makes for a surreal almost theatrical experience. Rodriguez's jazzy score accompanies this version of the film (played at normal speed). It's an odd way to spend eight minutes.<br /><br />The stories--a hit man (Josh Hartnett)carries out his job in the beginning and ending segments of the film getting close to his subjects and then killing them almost and treating them with surprising tenderness.<br /><br />The second story concerns Marv (Mickey Rourke)a bull headed thug who decides he has to find out who set him up as a murderer killing the only girl (Jaime King) tht had really been nice to him.<br /><br />The third story takes us into a bad part of town dominated by hard boiled hookers led by Gail (Rosario Dawson). When a nasty, girl friend beating guy named Jackie (Benicio Del Toro)tries to force one of Gail's girls to do something she doesn't want to, Gail and her girls take revenge. Dwight (Clive Owen)who has already had his own run in with Jackie. He wants to take the guy out as well. Gail and Dwight combine forces to take out Jackie unleashing hell on the girl's side of town.<br /><br />The third story focuses on police detective Hartigan (Bruce Willis)as he saves a little girl named Nancy from a pedophile (Nick Stahl). The only problem--the pedophile is the son of a powerful, corrupt politician (Powers Boothe)and the nephew of an evil Catholic Cardinal (Rutger Haur). When Hartigan castrates the senator's son he vows revenge by setting up Hartigan for the rape of Nancy. During his time in prison Nancy (Jessica Alba)stayed in touch with Hartigan secretly writing him letters. Parole comes up and the pedophile wants revenge against Hartigan. He also wants the one girl that got away.<br /><br />A terrific film version of Miller's stories, ""Sin City"" looks brilliant in its Blu-ray debut with plenty of special features."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	I can't even begin to describe how amazing and revolutionary this film is. An instant classic, like  Pulp Fiction on mescaline but at the same time standing by itself as possibly the best comic book adaptation. I have all the confidence in the world saying that because watching this film is like watching the graphic novel come to life. You hear critics say that about countless adaptations, but with this one, that statemant is about as literal as it gets.<br /><br />The city itself is amazingly constructed, the characters are legendary and lovable, just about every one of them's bad news and has some sort of psychological defect, whether its delusional psychosis, Mania, or Sadism or all three or even more. The story and dialouge arent necessarily original or even serious, but its not really meant to be, this film is a valentine to the noir and pulp comics of the golden age. The cinematography is as brilliant as it is beautiful. I truly can't describe at all how great it all is, you just have to sit down and take it all in for yourself, though not recommended for the kiddies, since each scene is riddled with ultra-violence and T&A galore.<br /><br />quite simply, a movie miracle, 'nuff said...
B001684L0A	2.0	b	"I have a bachelor's degree in history and love McCullough's works.  The book was so masterful and insightful, inspired, really-- one of my favorite books of all time.<br /><br />I don't disagree that the movie itself is well-made.  The acting is amazing, it is very well cast, and attention to detail is great.  Where the disappointment lies, for me, is in the distortion of the facts.  First, I was disgusted with how Adams has been mis-represented.  One of the wonderful things about the book is it shows a remarkable, yet human man whose role in history until now has been under-represented.  The movie focuses mainly on his shortcomings, making those central, while leaving out the good and/or distorting it.  This is not true of Abigail, who is much more accurately portrayed, but in this case it is almost as if it were done at the expense of her husband.<br /><br />My husband had not read the book but watched the series with me, and he thought Adams appeared to be a jerk, to put it mildly.  The relationship he had with his kids was a good one, but for theatrical purposes Adams was portrayed as a nearly abusive father with little or no compassion for his children.  This simply was not so.<br /><br />Not only have they distorted the goodness of the main character, but the filmmakers felt they needed to alter certain details to make the story more compelling.  The story itself was so compelling I couldn't put the book down, as if I were reading a novel.  In this case, the truth needed no embellishment, and sadly, some very compelling pieces of the story were left out.<br /><br />I wish they had just chosen to show this wonderful story as it occurred, instead of putting a ""modern"" spin on it.  Mainly left out were the details of John and Abigail's tremendous faith and moral rectitude, as well as John's true passion for learning and liberty (the movie portrays him only joining the American cause for liberty after he sees a man tarred and feathered by a mob, and he is enticed to give the rebellion some much-needed moderation).  The frontal male nudity was unnecessary, as were a few other gruesome scenes.<br /><br />This series was extremely well executed and had great potential, but was very disappointing in its representation of history and its Hollywood-ization.<br /><br />One John Adams main disappointments in life was that all his sacrifice for liberty and country were somehow lost and forgotten.  He felt he had been misunderstood and misrepresented, and yet his character had at all times been impeccable.  If he could see this film, I can't help but think how disappointed he would be to find that the masses are deluded yet again as to the real greatness of a great man."
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"Seriously, Robocop 3 is a masterpiece compared to this trash. The plot is razor thin and the dialogue is at the level of crap one has come to expect from George Lucas. This confirms that George Lucas is a hack. Easily the worst of the three Indiana Jones movies. Don't waste your time with this. A more appropriate title for this would have been ""The Quest For More Money"""
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"This movie finds the kid in all of us.  Once you watch this movie you'll understand what it means to ""hear the bell"" even as an adult.  Excellent family movie."
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	"But I went with 3 because of the hype this movie gets- some attention it deserves and other attention not so much. This movie just seemed to be almost desperatly trying to be cool. A movie that ""cool, enlightening"" kids and/or adults would love. Being in High School at the time of it's release it seemed every ""popular"" kid loved this movie. I mean maybe I have a bias, but it's just I didn't think it was that good. It's long, it jumps storylines with little connection and it overall is too ambitious for it's own good. I mean I love movies of similar sorts such as Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction, but this movie just was a bit too much for me. I think it's worth renting (although it's on Starz and HBO now to my knowledge) and I will see the second, it's just not as good as people make it out to be. Will most people actually like this movie? I doubt it. Great cast, great director, not so great story line = OK movie."
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	"First off, don't even try to compare this to Allen Ball's groundbreaking first series, SIX FEET UNDER - the acting and writing of which was shoulder-to-shoulder with the SOPRANOS and made HBO what it was at its peak.  If ""SIX FEET"" was a prime rib then this is cotton candy.  And yet when you get past the shaky first 3-4 episodes it is absolutely a guilty pleasure.<br />I am not crazy about the casting Paquin as Sookie.  She didn't deserve the roll, let alone the Emmy she got for it.  I don't get HBO's love affair with her.  Her accent is annoying and she is so clearly ""acting"".  To add to the over-wrought awkward performances is her brother, Ryan Kwantan (who was clearly hired because of how he looks with his shirt off and not because of his acting...eeek) and Bill the Vampire who sounds like Elvis when he says ""Aww Sookie""  Most of the supporting players also look like they're trying WAY too hard to appear southern or the clichet version of ""gay"" but end up coming off as plastic pretty people.<br />I love Vampire anything and while this show definitely feeds that monkey, I still wish it could be even be darker with more poetry and less camp.  Ball's use of the Vampire as an allegory for gay-tolerance is both brilliant in its concept and clunky in its execution.  I was very excited to see this show and like many of my friends was disappointed.<br />As I continued to watch each week, I found some things very entertaining in the series, long after my friends had written it off as mere cheese.  Funny how TRUE BLOOD got a second season ONLY 2 episodes into the first season which I believe happened because HBO needed a hit show so badly (and NEEDS Allen Ball) that they were going to give it a second season despite its obvious growing pains.  We'll see if HBO's unconditional love for Ball pays off in season 2.  I ultimately, think that HBO should hold all of its shows to the highest standard like it used to (when it HAD shows:-(<br />As I said, TRUBLOOD is junk food, a guilty pleasure and though mostly fun to watch, it isn't really as aware as it thinks it is."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This is an awesome story for Christmas days. The imagination of Chris Van Allsburg is amazing. You've never seen anything like this.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Multi-billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.) is the owner of a successful weapons industry. During one day in Afghanistan, he demonstrates for a group of U.S. soldiers a different kind of weapon that works successfully and gets kidnapped by terrorists as he's held captive and forced to make the weapons for them. Instead he uses his brilliant brains and creates a special armour-suit that helps him escape from hell and is sent back to the U.S., of course his friend Obadia (Jeff Bridges) wants to take over the corporation for himself and makes a deadly conspiracy. Thus Stark creates a more advanced, industructable and more powerful suit that makes him into ""Iron Man"" in which he serves to protect the innocent and fight evil.<br /><br />Intelligent, exciting and thrilling sci-fi actioner is based on a Marvel Comic Book and is the first great comic book movie of the year next to ""Dark Knight"". Gwyneth Palthrow co-stars as Stark's sexy secretary Pepper Potts and Terrence Howard as Colnel Rhodes, it's the greatest Marvel Movie since ""X2"" or ""Spider-Man 2"". Downy Jr. definitely nailed the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man well just like Christopher Reeve was to Superman, Tobey Mcguire to Spider-Man and Christian Bale was to Batman. Jeff Bridges made a belivable and excellent villain here in this motion picture, the special effects by ILM and Stan Winston are just outstanding including the acting. It stays true to the origins of the comic books even though a little of the origin is changed to a modern time, it's a truly satisfying and smart superhero movie that knows how to please the audience and critics alike thanks to the magic of it's smart script, great acting and fantastic action sequences with a nifty suprise at the end of the credits of this movie.<br /><br />This 2-Disc Blu-Ray is mindblowingly fantastic with it's nicely detailed picture and sound that will blow you away. The extras include a 7 part making of Documentary, featurette, Blu-Ray exclusives like Iron Man IQ Test and hall of armor, the actors Process, deleted and extended scenes, a sneek preview of the upcoming Iron Man animated series, Still gallery, and screen-test."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	This was a very entertaining movie, it had a surprising ending that you will either love or hate. I liked it, my wife hated it. But overall, it is one of the better police action movies I have seen recently. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that there were too many Hollywood actors trying on that Boston accent thing which triped me up a little, maybe if it had been filmed in New York or LA it would have been a little more genuine and believable.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	This is by far the best movie of the year and people that hate it just don't understand it. For the past 5 years M. Night Shyamalan has brought us shocking and original films that have frightened us and made us think about life and things we care for most. And Night's films are always dramatic with suspenseful moments. The Sixth Sense taught us about life, Unbreakable showed us that we should go out and do what God planned for us to do, and Signs shows us that everything happens for a reason.<br /><br />The Village shows us what happens when we try to protect those we love the most. And also what someone would do to save the person they truly love. M. Night Shyamalan really shines in this film. Jaquin Pheonix plays in his best acting job yet as a young boy destined to help the people of his village by planning to venture out into the forbbiden woods. Bryce Dallas Howard is what I can see to become the next big actress. She was phenomenal as Ivy Walker. Adrien Brody plays a very intresting mentaly disabled man. Other village members and great performances include William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, Brenden Gleesen,Judy Greer, and the rest of the elders.<br /><br />The Music to the film is one of the best scores I have ever heard in my entire life. James Newton Howard does a great job. Roger Deakins lighting was spectacular aswell.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE:Do NOT go see this film OR complain this film if you are wanting to get scared out of your skin. Movie Trailer NEVER make a movie look how it really is. The Village is being looked at by everyone as a Horror slasher film. In fact it is a Romatic Horror film. But it is very dramatic, with SOME frightening sequences. This film is just amazing. And I don't believe people are really giving this film or M. Night Shyamalan a real chance. The movie will be out soon and I hope everyone at least rents it so they can experience this great work of storytelling.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	I REALLY wanted to love this movie, but it left me somewhat disappointed, especially at the end. I was hoping it would be similar to Signs, but it didn't even come close! The acting was really great, and Bryce Dallas Howard was awesome. The problem is that the story fell short of all the hype that was going around. I agree with several reviewers who said that this movie was far more romantic than being scary, and the ending... well, I just didn't see it coming at all! I have M. Night's other movies in my DVD collection, but I believe I will pass on this one. I just hope the next movie he does will be up to the standards of The Sixth Sense, and Signs!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I couldn't wait to order this after seeing this on Comedy Central. I was laughing the whole time. I'm ordering this for myself to share with someone who needs cheering up and just a great hour of laughter.
B008UBYTRG	3.0	b	I just got this spark of insanity and thought it was not as good as arguing with myself.  I found parts of it not funny at all.  The first part the monolog with the audience is just hysterical.  The bit about the hybrid car and his new dog.  Very funny stuff.  Its after that its not funny. I don't see how a dead terrorist and puppet at that is funny.  But thats just me.  I did very much enjoy the extra about the creation of melvin and walter announcement.  Other than those two things.  Its just not funny.  Peanuts bit is okay.  I have seen other things that jeff has done such as late night shows with walter and its been funnier.  I am glad that I got the dvd as part of a gift certificate reward and I did not have to pay money for it.  I do not think I would have paid money for it.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I've been reading the Southern Vampire series since the first book came out.  I don't get HBO, but I read that this was the most popular HBO series since Sex & the City.  So when Season 1 came out on Blu-ray, I got it.  Season 1 is based on the first book in the series (there are now 9 books in the series).<br /><br />Overall, I love the tv series.  There are minor changes from the books.  The side characters get more screen time, such as Tara, Jason and Lafayette.  Tara was a wonderful, complex, tough and vulnerable best friend.  Jason was the comic relief.  Lafayette was very interesting, as he is now the cook, road crew, drug dealer, prostitute, and friend of Sookie.  Sookie had the scared/nervous grin and the same sweetness and toughness that she has in the books.  I didn't understand why the actors playing Sam and Bill were cast, but once I watched the tv series, I totally understand.  Bill was perfect - hot, a bit scary and cold, but really loving and protective of Sookie.  After watching this, forget about being Mrs. Cullen, I'll be Mrs. Compton.  It really reminded me why Sookie loved Bill in the beginning of the series.  Adele was great.  What really caught my eye was how complex and detailed each scene was.  It really made Bon Temps and Shreveport seem alive and full of individual, real characters.  Dawn, Hoyt, Rene, Arlene, Andy, Mike, Pam, they're all there.<br /><br />What I was really unprepared for and thought was a bit excessive: (1) There is a lot of swearing - lots of b*** and f*** from the cast.  (2) There is a lot of nudity (naked breasts, butts, back views) and vigorous sexual activity in almost every episode.  Jason is usually mostly naked in his scenes and mindlessly banging a mostly naked woman.  In the first episode alone, there is Maudette naked, her arms tied above her head to the ceiling, being violently bounced from behind by a vampire and later Jason.  Very graphic.<br /><br />Other than the 2 things above, I enjoyed the series so much I'd say 5 stars.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Loved this movie.  Great story line, great characters.  Kurt Cameron is superb! Some of the actors/actresses weren't that great at acting but the whole point of the movie overshadows that. A must see for married couples.  Two big thumbs up!
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	Movie very dark, slow moving, poor acting, and BAD director..... Became board and sorry for the purchase in the first 5 minutes. My rating: D.D.....for Double Dumb!!!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Wow! That is an awesome movie! The animation is just incredible, what the director and writers can do is just unbliveable! Every Christmas Eve until I was about 10 years old, my dad would read me the story. And now seeing the movie I am just amazed! I would encourage everyone of any age boy or girl to see this movie, it's well worth your money, and a great holiday choice!
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	A very cute movie that appeals to all ages. I took my 3 year old son to see it in the theater & knew we would have to buy a copy. My husband & 2 year old both enjoyed it on DVD. The romance between the 2 cars runs a little long for preschoolers but all in all a fun movie.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	The movie had a great pace to it.  It kept you in suspence for what was coming next.  Robert Downy Jr. played the part to perfection.  I can't wait for the sequil.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"This film is completely lacking in realism. The killer goes about his grim business with impunity, in a world that is practically devoid of people other than his prey. What utter non-sense! When are the American people going to wake up and realize that Hollywood is insulting their intelligence with a steady stream of such TRASH? Unless you equate gratuitous violence with so-called entertainment, you will not enjoy this film. I came away from it feeling, not entertained, but drained and dirty - exactly like the filth it is. Guard your eyes, for they are the window of your heart.<br /><br />If this is what constitutes ""being entertained"" today, count me out!"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I am absolutley addicted to this show.  Normally I would not watch anything this bad (meaning lots of sex and terrible language), but after reading the books, I could NOT NOT watch this.
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	I e-mailed vendor to tell them the product was not in New condition as advertised, they replied one time with what else was wrong beside not being factory wrapped.  I told them the discs were in pink CD holders like you would buy at office max, did not hear back from them after that. hopefully discs are viewable.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"All I can say is... wow.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese's The Departed is an action movie that builds in intensity right through to the end.  Two men, both products of the underbelly of Boston, end up going to police academy.  One, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), flourishes, but remains beholden to crime boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson).  The other, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), goes deep undercover to get the goods on Costello.<br /><br />Their lives weave around each other, until eventually they find themselves actively searching for one another, with fatal consequences.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson makes for a mean gangster, and transitions between a friendly ""uncle-type"" and an emotionless killer without missing a beat.<br /><br />This is a movie that will have you wishing you owned stock in one of those fake blood companies prior to production.  Be warned."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Walter, Peanut and Jose are quite funny.  The pimp and trailer trash puppets aren't.  However, I find myself crying every time I watch Jeff and Walter.
B004JMSIRC	2.0	b	Hype can work against anything that is mediocre.  If it doesn't live up to the hype, it becomes a bigger disappointment than would have without the hype. This movie, Ironman, was just an ordinary action movie. Personally, there are too may holes in the plot to live up to Stan Lee's reputation.  When you are expecting the detail and original ideas generated in comics or graphic novels you know that plot lines and details really matter.  This movie didn't live up to that scrutiny.<br /><br />As Marvel's first major production movie it was just OK.  Again, I was expecting to be told a story of Tony Stark, Stark Enterprises, Obediah, Pepper and war, that's what I got.  However, with the wealth of truly original story lines and material generated over 30 years of Ironman I expected the story to move and excite me.  It didn't.<br /><br />There are many different time lines and plot development techniques that could have been employed here.  Instead it was a straight forward and unfortunately, generic version of Ironman.  I had thought that with all the complaining Marvel did when the big studio's did, Spiderman(s), Daredevil, Ghostrider, The Fantastic 4(s) and X-Men that they themselves would have learned that it is not just a movie; these are legends.  These stories should be treated like the campfire legends of history. But instead, we just got a movie.<br /><br />In my opinion Jon Favreau did a good job, Robert Downey did an excellent job and although I didn't agree at first, Jeff Bridges did an excellent job as well.  They just had a Ho-Hum script to work with.  I would suggest sending the screenplay writers to Pakistan for some more research.<br /><br />Personally, I wish I would have rented this one rather than buying it.
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	The bonus disc is NOT worth the money.  I was under the impression there were going to be alot of deleted scenes & what we got was uninteresting.  I guess I assumed there'd be good deleted scenes b/c the movie left out so much.<br />Even though the trailer feel of the movie was alarming, the most frustrating part to me was how such delicious scenes from the book were completely alterred.  The beauty of the book was the mental drama Harry was going through as he's growing up.  The movie watered this down horribly.  What happened to the strong moments such as his snapping at Ron & Hermione about how they don't know what it's like for him.  And, oh my God, what they did to the incredible book scene of Harry trashing Dumbledore's office at the end!!  What's with the ridiculously calm & token scene of Harry & Dumbledore chatting things over.<br /><br />PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do NOT make these same mistakes in the upcoming movies.  I regret having bought this disc.  Should have got a cheap used copy at best.  I'm annoyed whenever I see this movie.  It only makes me yearn to see the actual story told.
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	I rented this thankfully so not a whole lot was wasted but my time. Me and my kids watched this together one night and even my kids 11 and 9 year old girls were bored to tears.  This movie lacks all substance and if your looking for a real plot look elsewhere.  Huge waste of time, want to watch a fun fantasy movie go back to Princess Bride or the newer Stardust but whatever you do skip this!!!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This particular episode is good as any of the others.  I liked some more than others but it keeps up.  It presents some death and that adds to the plot thickness, not all can be safe always or it gets boring, and it adds conflict with the school heads by replacing them with some individuals you wish would get squished in the film.  Everyone likes the head of the school, the old wizard, but this one even gives him trouble and more questions for Harry Potter to answer plus some things he learns to know he did not in prior movies, it all adds up in the plot.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Insanity is the greatest best workout. I have a hard time losing weight but I dropped 30lbs in 3 weeks. You haft to follow the diet plan. Which with this plan it was easy because it actually had food I liked. And you also haft to follow the calorie intake plan it has. It may seem like a lot but it truely works. I haft to take in 2300 calories where before I barely made it to 1000. My metabalism is amazing now. My strength has gotten better along with my balance and streching. I had a major migrane problem called chronic migrane illness. Since doing this workout I have had no headaches or arthiritis pains. It was caused by foods I was eating. My body feels so good. I actually hate eating restraunt food now. It has a lot of jumping so if you cant do that then this isnt for you. I had shin splints at first but I worked through it. It takes a lot of strength to really stick with it. Now my sister n law is doing it but she doesnt do the workouts properly. For example pushups. Instead of doing them on the ground she does it off the couch. So half hearted. So in 3 weeks she has lost only 6 lbs. I told her she has to follow the workouts to the t but she doesnt want to put the effort in. She is following the diet but thats for the strength you need to workout. The workout is why you drop weight. In 3 weeks I dropped 5 inches under my chest, 5 inches in the middle of my stomach, 4 inches in my hips, 3 inches in my upper leg, 2 inches in my calves (which I have had a hard time to get my calves to shrink because I used to be a roller bladder and have a lot of muscle in my calve and I hate how big they are. I dropped 2 inches which I have never been able to do) and 1 inch in my arms which I just lost this week because we are really working our arms now. The fit test truely shows lots of progress when you take it every two weeks. If you have no knee problems or major back problems then this truely works. Like I said I had some very painful back pains and havnt had them since ive done this program. Im not even cramping that time of the month. Which is proving my stomach muscles are strengthing up. If you dont have the motivation to really work hard then this is not for you. But if you want to see results this is the greatest best most wonderful workout ever. Its hard but worth it. Good luck to anyone that is doing it and hope you see the results I am. People I see everyday noticed a huge weight loss fast and where totally in shock thinking I got sick or something. I will totally suggest this workout to everyone I know! Thank you Shaun T for the awsome workout.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	Don't listen to paid reviewers of films. This was an excellent movie. The ending really caught me off guard. Didn't see it coming. I enjoyed it immensely!!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff never ceases to amaze, and he has done it again with this one.  His characters are funny and almost seem real.  If you are looking for a great DVD, this is it.  Can't wait until his others come out.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Great movie. Looks like it is set up for a sequel. Ended a little prematurely I thought. Have watched several times and I will probably watch again before too long. DVD quality was good as well.
B000H7I6CU	3.0	b	My kids love the movie & I even enjoy watching it too! Don't like that there is a bit of lying which is easily overlooked but that can get instilled in our kids, kids pick up the slightest details. So I address the lying each time it comes up in the video.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	The instructions on the preview were followed with no results.  What does one have to do to obtain the paid for DVD?
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	WE really enjoyed this movie and our grandchildren loved it, I would recommend this movie to any age group.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	This movie just lost me, and im not a big sci-fi fan but i just couldnt get into it. If you can watch this movie for free by all means do so. This movie is not worth a $1. I kept waiting for the movie to get better and it never happened.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This dvd will make you laugh until you hurt.  It is so funny.  I think Jeff Dunham is one of the best comedians.

B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff is great.  I bought this as a gift.  He brings a smile to anyone's face!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This was a great movie!  It did start out kind of amateurish, but after about 10 minutes and I had gotten into the movie, I was loving it!  The message about marriage in this movie is priceless, and as always, the Kendrick Brothers have stayed true to biblical content.  I have seen this movie at least 5 times and really could watch it everyday, it just makes me feel that good!
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	I actually really enjoyed this movie. I was, like most people (I think) worried that Bella Swan would show up biting her lip and ruin the movie but...honestly, it's was like a different actress was cast. Kristen Stewart was actually very enjoyable to watch. She's grown as an actress which is nice, good for her. Now, Charlize Theron was simply the best. So creepy and crazy; she really made the film. I don't need to go on about her talent, everyone should just know by now ;o)<br />The acting was good. The colors and filming were great and the story was pretty solid. I liked the bonus features which I found entertaining and informative so yeah, I recommend this Blu ray package.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	This dvd quality is really bad in terms of Good like new as i found on the web-site.<br />It pops so much time and doesn't play well. The seller must explain the truth.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I get tired of seeing the same movie over and over again.  Most movies have basically the same plot, a similar timeline, and a near-identical ending.  Pretty soon, they start bluring together and you can't even remember which ones you've seen and which ones you haven't seen.<br /><br />No Country For Old Men is guaranteed to be memorable.  First of all. the setting is masterfully done.  It takes place in Southwest Texas in 1980.  I watched a few scenes from the movie while it was playing at someone else's house. When I saw all of the 1970s era trucks, clothing, and town scenes, I HAD to see the movie.  They did such a good job portraying Southwester Texas from 30 years ago, that almost makes it worth it right there.<br /><br />As everyone has heard, the movie is full of violence and brutal murders.  It was not random pointless violence though.  It all fit into the storyline and all had the effect of building suspense and adding to the plot.  There is a lot of thematic material.  I was thinking in terms of archetypes and all that stuff I was forced to learn in high school. YOu have the old Sheriff, played ty Tommy Lee Jones, who is essentially a good guy who only wants to do right, you have the protaganist, the small time cowboy from the trailer park, who finds the suitcase of money from the drug deal gone bad, and you have the psychotic killer who is after him.<br /><br />The movie got me thinking, how much is money really worth? Would I take that suitcase of money?  Is money worth your life?  When you are watching this movie, pay attention to this:  HOw much is the money worth, both literary and figuratively.  In one of the early scenes, you hear it stated that there are 2 million dollars in that briefcase.  But as the movie goes on, look at the money and make your own estimate of its value.  Lets see if you can catch what I am talking about.<br /><br />A lot of people hated the ending, because it isn't the same Disney movie kind of ending that we are used to. GOOD is what I say.  I'm tired of knowing exactly what is going to happen 15 minutes into each movie.  Think of this movie as a journey rather than a destination, but the final words give you something to think about.  I think part of the thematic material involves knowing your liminations.  Lets see if you come to the same conclusion as me.  Check out this movie, a film that is actually worth watching, suspensful and full of suprises.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	Let me start by saying I'm not a huge Robert Rodriguez fan.  I've seen a number of his films.  I saw all three of his El Mariachi/Desperado/Once Upon a Time in Mexico trilogy, each time thinking, oh surely I'll like _this_ one.  But I never really was crazy about his stuff.  So when this came out, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it.  And I didn't.<br /><br />Then one night in a hotel room I saw a trailer for it.  And I changed my mind and immediately rented it.  It was visually incredible. It's like you could stop each and every frame of this movie and it would replicate a page from the graphic novel/comic book.  (No, I haven't read any of them, but you can just tell the artistry in framing everything.  It's stunning.)<br /><br />There are some down sides.  It's excruciatingly violent, so if you are offended by that, then obviously stay away.  In addition, I never felt particularly close to any of the characters so when violence happened to them, I didn't really feel anything.  (I am particularly thinking of the Carla Gugino character here.)  I'm not sure if that was deliberate or not, but I wish it had elicited something more from me emotionally.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke was incredible and almost unrecognizeable, but I thought Elijah Wood did a great and creepy job as well.<br /><br />My favorite Rodriguez movie ever.  Hands down.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	A good friend of mine bought himself a Blue Ray player and a big old TV and then, as you do bought a couple of movies to watch and invited some friends over.  I was the only person that went along for the show and about 20 minutes into this film I began to squirm.<br /><br />Sequels get a bad rap, but this was unnecessarily bad.  If you want to watch an Indiana Jones movie got and buy a copy of Raiders of the Lost Arc and sit back and enjoy it, this is not even close to being in the same class.  What you get instead is Harrison Ford trying his best to work with a bad script, a horrible plot in a movie that lacks suspense, joy, excitement or clarity.  Blanchett's horrible Russian accent immediately confirmed that nobody who made this movie gave a damn about its outcome - it was just a pay day.<br /><br />That will teach him to buy movies without reading reviews first.  Hopefully you are smarter than he was!
B0006989TE	4.0	b	I know not alot of people in the theater I was in didn't like it but I did.<br /><br />Most of the comments I was hearing was how confused people were by the end.  I can see how that would be for some people because the commercials for the movie were rather misleading to what the movie was really about.<br /><br />I found it was alot like 'The Sixth Sense', in that nothing is as it seems.  Joaquin Phoenix was great as always.  Bryce Dallas Howard was fantastic in her film debut.  Her father should be proud.  Adrian Brody, playing the village idiot, was a laugh one minute and a shock the next.<br /><br />I want to see the movie again, after knowing the twist, to see if I can catch any hints to the twist.<br /><br />I love that M. Night is keeping his movies local.  He's the pride of Philly.  I love to see where he pops up in his movies.<br /><br />You need to pay attention carefully to the movie, if you do then it shouldn't be too confusing to watch and you might just enjoy it like I did.<br /><br />The only other good thing that I can say is, The Village was good enough to keep you talking about it long after it's over.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I really liked this DVD. Jeff Dunham is so good, you actually ""forget"" that his friends are puppets! Such a variety of characters: cranky old guy, flashy black guy, not-too-bright white guy, even hispanic ""on a stick""! So funny, you'll laugh till you cry!"
B00447G29S	4.0	b	Very colorful,great 3d,pretty interesting Xmas story,I'm an adult who just enjoys 3d movies, me and my wife enjoyed this family-kids movie.The color was just awesome.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Based on Stan Lee's comic book, ""Ironman"" comes to the big screen. ""Ironman"" seems as an appealing superhero movie inasmuch as it has action sequences, a genuine script, and a pleasant acting.<br /> ""Ironman"" is the story of this inventor/armsdealer Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) who is the inheriting owner of an arms company. He has a playboy personality, that's why he is always surrounded by women (most of them models). So, he was in Afghanistan testing his new weapon for selling to the U.S. Army, when suddenly there is an explosion and he is kidnapped by a terrorist group of this region. Then, while he is imprisoned; he creates a special metal suit, in order to get out of that place.<br /> On his way back to the United States, he calls for a press conference and informs them that his company is no longer going to manufacture weapons. After this swift decision, he gains some opponents. Another day, he was working in his lab when he saw on television how evil the Afghan terrorists were with innocent people; at this, he gets mad and decides to improve his suit, but now, he uses better materials and equipment, so he can fight against them.<br /> A positive element in this film, directed by Jon Favreau (Elf, 2003), is the special effects which we can notice in the engaging action scenes, also the locations where these fights are being held are fantastic, and the high technology used in the movie is amazing. The concise and accomplished script is funny and engaging, too, we can understand well the personality of each character, it has some funny lines (typical of Marvel's films) and there is a contrastive variety of scenes and situations that are going to keep you glued to your seat.<br /> The most remarkable point in this movie is the main characters' awesome acting. One of the best performances is Gwyneth Paltrow's, starring as Pepper Potts, Stark's lovable and reliable assistant who has a fresh look. She is always taking care and worrying about him. She also organizes his life; for example, she arranges his dates, his work, and his house. Pepper calls to mind Alfred, the majordomo on ""Batman"", because they both keep their friends' superhero identity in secret.<br />On the other hand, Robert Downey, Jr. can perform brilliant roles, such as: ""The Singing Detective"" (2003), as a superdetective, and ""Tropic Thunder"" (2008), as an Australian who plays a black man; for this role, he was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award. Now, he is a super hero and it is a role that matches for him as well. The supporting roles are also remarkable: we got Terrence Howard as Stark's military buddy Rhodey and Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane. Director Jon Favreau has also one scene minor role as Tony's driver and the comic writer Stan Lee has a brief part, too, as an old man in a party with some girls around him (Hugh Hefner type).<br /> ""Ironman"" (2008), a Paramount Pictures movie, is rated PG-13 for action sequences and violence. Running time: 126 minutes."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	great video,  very funny and even better then seen on comedy central with the extra footage
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	This one got pretty trashed by the critics, so maybe that lowered my expectation. But I ended up enjoying this more than I thought I would, and actually liked it better than the other two sequels - it seemed closer in spirit to the original. Sure, there were some incredibly silly parts (the fridge, the waterfalls), but it moved along quickly enough that I didn't get bogged down in the inanity. Plus the appearance of Karen Allen helped pick things up immensely.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I loved this movie. I found the movie funny with great special effects, and most of all I found it very refreshing to see a movie tastefully done without all the profanity that you see nowdays in movies.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	If you already have this movie please<br />don't buy this one just for the 3D effect! Its awful!<br />The people all have extra eyes, ect and gives you a major<br />headache to watch! The only things that was even a little bit 3D<br />were the snowflakes, a cup in the hot chocolate scene, and the ticket when its flying in the air. Don't waste your money on it!
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"Yep Mr. Riddle has returned and the minister of magic (Robert Hardy) refuses to believe this. Of course everyone sides with the minister against Harry and his closest friends. Dudley (Harry Melling) practically gets sucked to death and the Dursley's (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths) get a new flat screen T.V.<br /><br />The story plods along and leaves out key information revealed in the book. Every character stares at their feet and counts from one to ten before making their calculated statements. The film carries the story forward but does little to contribute other than a prophecy which takes all of five minutes.<br /><br />I do have to say that there was one good exception Helena Bonham Carter made a believable Bellatrix Lestrange the crazed dispatcher of Neville's parents.<br /><br />In place of story and acting we have lots of CGI filler. The graphics are par with today's technology with the exception of the department of mysteries; that location looked so phony that you would think you were watching Saturday morning cartoons.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026YWQ4Q"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	i saw this on a theatre and WOW, i said i must have this one on my collection, then a few weeks ago I bougth my 1st blu-ray player, and waited all this time until I saw it in Blu-ray format, and again WOW.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is the most hilarious DVD ever!  Jeff Dunham an awesome ventriloquist and his characters are just too funny!  If you need a good laugh, this will do it!
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	I heard they're making another movie.  Hopefully it'll be better then this one.  With that being said, it was great seeing Harrison Ford back as Indiana Jones.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"To tell the truth, I was a little disappointed in Sheriff Bell.  No one forced him to become a lawman, to confront evil as a business.  I don't mind the movie's post-modernism (evil sometimes triumphs) or its existentialism (things happen randomly) but the lack of professionalism is just unacceptable.*<br /><br />Anyhow, a good movie if you like the genre, or the Coen Brothers.  It's got a lot of Fargo in it, a lot of Blood Simple too.  But it's its own thing.<br /><br />*  I do recognize the fact that a professionalism is necessarily a belief in duty, and postmordernism would posit that a belief in duty (e.g., Marshall Kane in ""High Noon"") is pointless or even should be attacked as outmoded, not useful and superstitious.  Postmodernists are a grim bunch."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I saw Jeff about 20 years ago on TV and immediately became a fan of his. I hadn't seen anything from him in a long time and had wondered whether he was still around. I was thrilled when I happened to be flipping channels and saw his name in the channel guide on Comedy Central one weekend. After watching the show twice that weekend I went online and found that Amazon carried it on DVD. Since receiving the disc I have shown it to many friends and family members and they all agree he is the best they have ever saw. His interaction with the audience is another part that I thoroughly enjoy. If you have never seen Jeff work his magic do yourself a favor and order this disc and be prepared to laugh yourself silly. I hope Jeff will be around for years to come and will continue to release new material on DVD. I know I will be the first in line to add another disc to my collection.
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	The movie looks awful in DVD format, and it's done on purpose. As the movie studios scuffle over which HD bandwagon to get on this year, Warner figures they'll help their HD hardware brethren by releasing newER DVD titles purposely watered down. The consumer is stupid and they'll never notice such subtleties, right? Hell, the compression is so bad I can actually count the pixels in Daniel Radcliffe's face (hmm...1, 2, 3...3?).<br /><br />And to think I'm watching this on a 1080p set with an upscaling player. Imagine what it looks like without the help of an upscaler!<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />Review? It's hard to review a movie that isn't aesthetically pleasing.<br /><br />If you bought this movie, be sure to call and complain to WB.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Sexy, Addictive and doesn't dissapoint!<br />I love all of the characters, their different personalities and situations......Excellent character developement!<br />The sexual tension/desire between Sookie and Bill is delicious!<br />I don't get HBO, so I'm in major withdrawls waiting for Season 2 to come out on DVD! I haven't had the pleasure of reading Charlaine Harris' novels, so I will be reading them while I wait! AAA+++<br />[A warning to some: Very Sexually Explicit!]
B001684L0A	5.0	b	We got these originally on Netflix and bought them so we could show them to our kids when they get a little older.  Very interesting and highly educational!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Thought the movie was great better than the last Harry Potter movie.  Very much looking forward to the next movie, Harry Potter and the deathly Hollows, part 2...
B0006989TE	3.0	b	I have to say that I do not like particularly scary movies. But the idea of the film sounded great. A little community isolated, surrounded by a forest and with threatening creatures living in.The film is correct. Shyamalan knows what he is doing and also, let's face it, he has his own peculiar style. But in spite of some moments when I jumped from my seat, I think the idea of the film is again a game with us, poor viewers being teased by the director.<br /><br />I like the part  of the film when the life in the village is depicted, but unfortunately it is too short. The characters are too bi-dimensional. And also too stereotypical. The blind girl who can see what others cannot, the leader of the community, the represion in which all of them are living.<br /><br />Personally I think that the critic of fear as a way to manipulate  people is very interesting; but this idea vanishes as long as we are put in the middle of a regular fairy tale. The girl pursued by the big bad woolf, the woods as the primal source of fear, and an end that is shocking only for a moment.<br /><br />The director has created a beautiful package for an irrelevant story. The locations, the colors and the music just wrapped something that is a project of what could have been an inetresting film.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	I was very happy with my purchase. I received item within a week of purchase and very good price for a blu ray. I would gladly purchase from seller again...
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Reviewers who received advanced copies of the Iron Man Blu-ray release reported that the Dynamic Range Compression (DRC) flag was active on the Dobly TrueHD audio track, causing a less-than-stellar audio experience for customers who weren't savvy enough to adjust their player and amplifier to compensate.<br /><br />The good news is that Paramount confirmed on September 25th that they had recalled all of the defective copies and replaced them with newly-authored discs that fix this issue. [...]<br /><br />This recall occurred prior to Iron Man's release, so no one should have wound up with a defective copy except for the reviewers who received their copies in advance. You can purchase with confidence without worrying whether your product is the corrected one, unlike with the Back to the Future DVDs and Pirates of the Carribbean I Blu-ray which still have defective copies unknowingly being sold by some stores despite having been re-authored after the initial batch.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"Traditional Film Noir meets Robert Rodriguez in this epic dramatization of Frank Miller's Graphic Serial, ""Sin City"".  The resulting picture is visually astounding and hauntingly dramatic.<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller take us on journey through three separate stories that ultimatley intersect through out the movie. The stories include a man-hunt for the killer of a ""Perfect Woman"", an aging cop about to retire who has to complete that one last bust, and a group of women who rule the area of Basin City called ""Old Town"".<br /><br />The direction and editing of this movie are no less than we would expect from Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez reminds us that he is extremly good at what he does. The whole film is shown in Black and White and seems to take place in the 1930's, preserving the feel of Noir.  To give it a modern twist, colors and cell phones were added in.  We see a woman in a red dress standing at the edge of a balcony, a man who's so evil his skin has turned a putrid yellow, and other more subtle touches, such as Alexis Bledsole's eyes and the flashlight as it shines on Clive Owen's face.<br /><br />The over-the-top acting deserves an A+. If it were any other cast, I'd think it was just bad acting.  However, the A-List stars have taken the film ""to the next level"" (Sorry, I had to throw a Spy Kids quote in). It adds a fantasy feel to what otherwise would just be another dramatic movie.  It is similar to the acting in Molholland Drive during the dream sequence. Probably the best perfomance is done by Mickey Rourke as Marv, I didn't even recognize him st first. Hopefully Marv can do for Mickey what Cap'n Jack Sparrow did for Johnny. Elijah Wood also shows us that he can be more than just a ""Hobbit from the Shire"".<br /><br />This movie contains strong violence. A man is beaten to death, and another is fed to a dog. There are suggestions of Child Molestation, Prostitution, and a couple of characters use Religion to justify cannibalism. Though there are some bloody sequences, most use a bright white goop to signify blood, looking more like a bird pooped on them. Like Kill Bill, body parts are sliced off non-chalantly, but unlike Kill Bill, it's kept below 100.  There is also some tongue-in-cheek comic relief. Watch for the bow and arrow scene.<br /><br />Viewers who enjoy this movie will also like both Kill Bill Movies and ""Pulp Fiction"", by ""Guest Director"" Quentin Tarantino and ""Once Upon A Time In Mexico"" or ""Desperado"", Robert Rodriguez.  You may also want to check out some other Modern Noir Films like ""Molholland Drive"" (David Lynch) and ""Never Die Alone"", as well as Tradtional Film Noir flix, ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Notorious"", and ""The Maltese Falcon"".<br /><br />All in all this movie is a must see for Film Noir and Rodriguez/Taratino Fans alike."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I learned a lot about the scientific community and how they shun anyone who even entertains the possibility of an outcome that they do not approve of.  This video interviews people who have suffered professionally because they have simply let themselves entertain the idea that there may be other, better explanations of the origins of life.  Ben Stein offers an intelligent, informative expose of the current biases and harsh realities of the scientific community.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Love the action in this movie, I loved the actors and the suspense. I would recommend this movie to all my friends.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I wish they would make more movies like John Adams. Fabulous acting and great sets etc. Inspired me to read about Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and Abigail Adams. And next year I am going to Virginia to Monticello!!
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Excellent production, different twist on Snow White, with an excellent cast to pull it off. I would recommend it to adults that appreciate fantasy.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is the best ever!  Achmed and Walter are great!!  Jeff Dunham is very talented - I'm a new and big fan.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	It's so nice to see some time a good movie like this.Hope in the future there'll be more and the good SF movie
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	Martin Scorsese  should get his long overdue Oscar,but this Fim isn't on par with His best overall works,but he is overdue. the Acting&overall pacing was Good in this film. the story was pretty easy to pick up on. it ran a bit too long&the Music didn't really run with the film as have past Scorsese films.very watchable film&has some interesting moments.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Until X-Mas of this year i had never heard of Jeff Dunham. Now, I could watch this dvd everyday.  HE is funny and imaginative. I forget that he is using puppets. his 2nd dvd ""Spark of insanity"" is just as good."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Most people on Amazon -- and I count myself among them -- reviewing movies or TV shows primarily review the film or series and not the product.  As a rule, I think this is more helpful than focusing on features, extras, packaging, and such.  Because these change and usually (though not always) Amazon links the old versions to the new, comments about these can become irrelevant.  I am making an exception to this product, the Blu-ray 2-disc edition of IRON MAN, simply because it is the first movie that I bought on Blu-ray.  I previously had bought two TV series on Blu-ray, but this is the first film.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Sony Playstation 3, primarily for watching movies, though secondarily for playing games.  I limiting my Blu-ray purchases until the prices for the discs come down to around the same level as DVDs.  On the other hand, I'm virtually cutting out my purchases of DVDs entirely, since the new format is already on hand.  I wouldn't be surprised if overall DVD sales started to drop if more people follow the kinds of buying patterns I'm currently practicing.  We are in an in between period.  The format war is over and Blu-ray has won, but not enough people own Blu-ray players because they are priced too high.  But just as I stopped purchasing LPs and cassette tapes once CDs were released, so I'm ceasing buying DVDs.  But my purchasing of Blu-ray is minimal.  Mostly I rent from Netflix.<br /><br />Which leads to the question, why buy Blu-ray at all?  Well, only if there is enough in the product to justify it.  In the case of IRON MAN, I believe what you get justifies the cost.  I was a little nervous the first time I put a Blu-ray on, wondering if the difference was going to justify the money I had expended.  I'm delighted to say that it did.  The main feature, of course, looks extraordinary.  But IRON MAN is unique in contrast with the other Blu-ray films and series that I have watched in the format in the amount of extras also in 1080 high-def.  I think this will change quickly as Blu-ray matures as a form, but currently many releases have the main feature in 1080 high def, but many of the features in a lower resolution.<br /><br />IRON MAN also has an amazing number of special features that I actually enjoyed watching.  Too often special features just seem to be filler, put there to make the purchaser that there is more to the item purchased than there is.  And frankly, more often than not I don't bother with special features at all.  But I find projects like IRON MAN to be quite fascinating, since it involves combining several technologies to create the final main character, including the main actor, stunt doubles, high tech suits, robots, and extensive CGI.  Frankly, going behind the scenes of most movies -- even most very good movies -- is not terribly interesting.  But in the case of a high-tech super hero movies, it is very nearly as much fun as the main feature itself.  I especially enjoyed the series of short features documenting the making of the film.  I find that I enjoyed the movies itself more fully on rewatching than I did the first time through.<br /><br />IRON MAN is important not merely for being a very good movie, but for being the first movie by a new studio that is certain to be among the greatest producer of box office smashes in the next decade.  After watching several Marvel characters drive some of the greatest box office hits of the past decade, Marvel has established its own production company.  The goal is ultimately an Avengers movie and to that end they are bringing out a string of movies over the next 3 or 4 years, introducing potential new members of the Marvel answer to the JLA.  We have already been introduced to Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (and I hope everyone who has watched IRON MAN stuck around after the closing credits to be introduced to Nick Fury, who gets his own movie something early in the next decade -- this will almost certain star Samuel L. Jackson, who gave his permission to serve as the model for Fury in The Ultimate Nick Fury comic release).  Marvel has announced movies based on Thor, Captain America, and Ant-Man, all of whom were members of the Avengers in one or another version, along with Iron Man and the Hulk.  Marvel's formula, based on IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK, as well as the movies they are striving to cast (the word is that Daniel Craig recently turned down the offer to star in THOR), is to make a character based film focused primarily on a high-profile actor (Robert Downey Jr., Edward Norton, and if he had taken the offer Daniel Craig), and then build the action around him, instead of having the character as an afterthought to the action.  It has worked wonderfully in the Spider-Man movies (which was primarily a Sony production).  When and if they do an Avengers movie, the cost of the cast alone should be jaw dropping.  However, Marvel isn't focusing on the Avengers alone.  They have also announced their intention to do a film based on my own favorite Marvel series, Brian K. Vaughan's The Runaways, about a group of empowered teens in California who discover that their parents are super villains, causing them to become runaways (hence their name).  Though the Runaways have been tangentially included in Marvel Big Events like the Civil War and the Secret Invasion, they aren't centrally involved in the rest of the Marvel Universe.  There will also be a Silver Surfer film, hopefully with Galactus as his foe.<br /><br />My fear is that Marvel is going to be exclusively focused on producing titanic box office smashes.  Though I will add that both IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK focus on character enough to make both far more than cinematic comic books.<br /><br />My last comment is that as a Robert Downey Jr. admirer, I couldn't be happier that he seems to have conquered his personal demons to enjoy the greatest commercial success of his career.  He is a first rate actor who has been in many, many fine movies over the years, often in independent productions, but for a while it looked like his career might be over.  Although he proudly points out that even during the years when he struggled with drug addiction and never missed a single day of shooting on any film, after his final rehab and jail stint insurers would not insure his films.  I know that Woody Allen had to drop him from one project because they couldn't get insurance for him.  Gradually, however, he managed to work his way back.  He is especially good to see in this role because his own personal problems parallel those of Tony Stark in the comics.  Like Downey earlier in his life, Tony Stark struggles with alcoholism.  The film only shows him drinking.  I wonder if IRON MAN 2, which was just announced, will show Stark dealing with his drinking.  I hope so.  It has been the focus on things like this that have made several of the Marvel movies so enjoyable.  Although there is great action, ultimately they are about believable, very human individuals who become heroes.  The more human you make the characters, the more delightful they become as heroes.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Kept my interest and it was pretty true to original storyline. I would recommend it to others to see if they like adventure/mystery/action
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Food, Inc. is a must see film which is extremely well done and informative.  I had to read nearly 24 books to get to the information in this film and the film is easier to watch than reading all those books!  This is a message that will assist individuals in making important decisions about their nutrition and the foods that they purchase.  It is about how to rebuild our own communities and our own health one bite at a time.  It is about assisting our neighbors who are less fortunate right now and strengthening them for healthier lives too.  I see that Oprah talked about this film on her show and interviewed Michael Pollan about his new book.  I want to share this with everyone I know...I have shared it with nearly 50 friends so far and I see one online DVD service is offering it free for viewing.<br /><br />This is vital information for us all - very positive and honest look.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I have always been somewhat active but not in as fit as I would like to be I wanted to share some comments on Insanity having also done P90x.  I have found with Insanity the cardio emphasis has been helping me get the weight loss going much faster.  It's really about getting lean,strong and flexible whereas P90x involves more weight training with resistance bands, chinup bar and other tools. For me its much easier not to have to use all the equipment and just my body as the ""weight"". Depending on your goal both are excellent but  I find I'm still building muscle but am much leaner with Insanity.  I highly recommend Insanity if your goal is weight loss and overall cardio endurance and flexibility."
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	This product would not even play. There were multiple scratches on the DVD. I would not advise purchasing a copy of this movie, or any movie from this particular carrier.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Saw movie in theater and thought it was great.  I bought it to show it in my teacher ed methods social studies course.  I had been showin<br />g power of food but find this film easier for them to grasp.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	We have been watching this movie on demand lately.  When they finally took it off the list, we decided to buy it in blu-ray.  We were amazed at the quality difference between blu-ray and standard.  It sounds better, the colors are brighter and the images have so much more detail.  The closest to a 3D experience than I've had so far.  Highly recommended if you have the technology.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I wish I would have seen this when I was preparing to get married. It will now be my wedding gift to my nieces and nephews.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	this was an excellent purchase for me. it came on time and speedy and was in excellent condition- no damages from shipping and still in the shrink wrap. was not what i had expected but still a great movie - much better then Hulk.
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	"Because this is a movie about violent people, the violence depicted is hardly gratuitous, but it made the movie unwatchable for me.  ""The Departed"" promises a satisfyingly intricate story, and I regret that I could not give the movie its due."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie is a lot of fun for all ages. I especially enjoy the surround sound which is actually 6.1 DD-EX - most movies are only released in 5.1 DD...
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I enjoyed this movie throughout, had some interesting characters in it and was pretty decent.  You'll either love or hate this film, probably because of how it ended.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Everything about the John Adams series is outstanding--the acting, the script, the character development, the locations. Costumes & makeup are amazing. Really evokes the period, develops the complex personalities of the founding fathers. Gives the audience a real foundation and understanding of the time. Absolutely first rate.

Other people have gone into the woods and have never returned.  They are found dead.<br />  The color ""red"" is not allowed in this community.

B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This visual graphics are great!  The story is great!  The movie is fun and funny!  Just go and get it, quickly!!!
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	For enthusiasts, the bit rate of this DVD stays around or below 5 Mbit/s most of the time. Compression artifacts such as mosquito noise and block noise can be seen often. For an anamorphic 2.31:1 movie transferred in 2008, that's below standards, considering the running time is only 122 mins and there aren't many extras. (I do not intend to review the movie here).<br /><br />They must be doing this to sell blu-ray discs, what a shame.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"My favorite comic book character has always been Iron Man.  I was excited when I heard that there was going to be an ""Iron Man"" movie, and even more thrilled when I saw the first trailer.  The movie more than lived up to the hype.  I mean, come on...who wouldn't dream of owning a powerful suit of red/gold armor like this?<br /><br />There are two big reasons why the movie is so well done.  First, there's Jon Favreau.  Favreau is a comic book fan.  I've said for a long time now, that you have to know the comic book character in order to do a good movie.  Richard Donner read Superman comics.  Nolan is a Batman fan.  Sam Raimi has been a Spider-Man fan since he was a kid.  Favreau knows the character of Tony Stark and Iron Man.  And Favreau pulls out all the stops to turn in one of the best superhero movies of all time.  I put this one up there with the two Batman movies, Superman: The Movie, and Spider-Man 2.<br /><br />The second big reason is Robert Downey Jr.  He makes Stark jump off the screen.  Downey Jr. gives Tony Stark all of the suaveness of the multi-billion dollar tycoon as well as his humanity.  Downey Jr. can deliver a line as good as any of the best actors out there.  He's always been that good.  It's a shame that his various ""distractions"" have prevented him from showing everyone how good he is...until now!  This is Downey Jr.'s ""coming back"" role.<br /><br />It seems Stark only cares about making money, no matter who it hurts.  And in this case, he's given a rude awakening when he finds out that his company, which manufactures weapons, is killing many people around the world.  It is at this point that he decides to put an end to the company, and Iron Man is created, initially to save his life, but also to help bring his own company down and destroy the weapons that he has created.<br /><br />Enter Obadiah Stane, wonderfully portrayed by Jeff Bridges.  He's Stark's second-in-command, and there's more going on within Stane's own agenda than meets the eye.  The last thing he wants is to see the company go under.  After all, helped get the company off the ground with Tony Stark's father.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is perfectly cast as Stark's loyal secretary, Pepper Potts.  She seems to be the only one who sees that the change in Tony Stark goes beyond the damage to his heart.  For Pepper Potts, Tony Stark has finally found his heart.  Paltrow plays Pepper Potts without going over-the-top.  She seems to have an attraction for him, but something holds her back, and the scenes with Paltrow and Downey Jr. are very good.<br /><br />Finally, we have Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend, James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes.  While in the comic, Rhodes is a former pilot.  Here, he's an air force colonel with a lot of power within the military.  Howard does a decent job with Rhodes, and who can forget his great line as he's walking by the suit of Iron Man armor, ""Next time!""  (If you aren't familiar with the comic, Rhodes takes over the mantle of Iron Man for a time and even eventually becomes ""War Machine."")<br /><br />The special effects are absolutely brilliant.  Seeing Iron Man soaring through the skies with his boot jets is a treat.  He looks real slick in that suit of armor, and it's especially enjoyable seeing him go into action for the first time in his red and gold suit.<br /><br />The best superhero movies are those in which the focus is on the character, rather than the superhero.  Tony Stark is a character we like, and Robert Downey Jr. is the reason for bringing him to life on screen. And through Tony Stark, Iron Man works all the more when he's finally on screen.<br /><br />If there is one thing that I wished for the movie, it's that there was a longer climactic battle scene between Iron Man and Iron Monger.  I was also hoping that some of the battle would take place in the sky instead of entirely on the ground.  I wanted Favreau to really show what Iron Man can do.  But something like this is easily overlooked because the movie is so well done.<br /><br />Also, ""Iron Man"" is just plain fun!  It never takes itself too seriously, nor does it really tread into darker realms like some superhero movies.  But then, Iron Man isn't supposed to be a dark character.  Wearing bright red and gold armor, he represents a hero from way back when; when heroes were knights who wore armor and helped to defend those who couldn't defend themselves.  Stan Lee himself said that this was a big reason why he created a superhero who wears armor.<br /><br />I can't wait to see more of Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. in ""Iron Man 2.""  I have a strange feeling that it will be even better than this one...and that's saying a lot."
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	Aside from the pretty visuals and the occasional good moment from Chris Hemsworth this movie was terrible.  The story and plot were weak at best and full of holes.  Lots of bad choices as well that seemed to happen because it would look cool but added nothing.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"The filmmakers behind Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix have done something unbelievable. Not only they have parted completely from the light and happy world created by the first two films, but they've also ignored any type of film summary. There's no synopsis of everything that's gone before. And good for that, I say. Go rent the other four if you need to catch up.<br /><br />Year five at Hogwarts begins with our hero Harry angrier than ever. Harry has spent the summer being ignored by everyone after he was discredited by the Daily Prophet for daring to suggest that Lord Voldemort has returned.<br /><br />Once again, Harry and company will have to fight he-who-shall-not-be-named while combating an government that insists and refuses to acknowledge the return of Voldemort. In doing so, the government steps up and introduces a new headmistress at Hogwarts: Dolores Umbridge.<br /><br />You will find that these are indeed ""darker"" times for all the HP characters. Working with writer Michael Goldenberg, director David Yates have crafted a dark tale to entertain anyone watching. The effects shows us fantastic creatures. But it's the performances where a film is really sold and here they are wonderful.<br /><br />The three leads, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, have all settled easily into their roles. But it's in the supporting cast where these films really shine. Filling out secondary roles with the cream of British theatre and cinema, like Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis and Ralph Fiennes, everyone else must rise to their level, and they do.<br /><br />The movie shows us the ""weird"" phase we all go between adult and child, between doing what's right and following the rules and between knowledge and comprehension. When all is said and done, Harry has grown as a character. He is on his way to adulthood with an understanding of the things he's learned in the previous four films.<br /><br />However, there are worrying signs that there are no real developments from film to film: there are no substantial increase in maturity in the films themselves. Every time I sit down to a new Harry Potter movie, I'm surprised by how very similar it is to the previous one.<br /><br />There is a definite feel with The Order of the Phoenix that the story is killing time - setting the scene for the battles yet to come in the last two chapters. This isn't a criticism as such, it's just that having to do that does leave a few unanswered questions. But then, what good would a series be without a few cliffhangers?"
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I had previously only watched the standard DVD edition of the film, which was a really bad transfer, very noisy. This transfer, however, is stunningly crisp. Blu-ray also offers a much better interaction with the menus. Even if you already own a copy of this movie on DVD, I would suggest you get the Blu-ray version. You won't be disappointed.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	My family really enjoyed this movie.  It's NOT a horror film, not even really a suspense flick - and yes - you can see the ending from a mile away.  I had sort of figured it out about halfway through the movie and by the time the last half hour came along it had all been exposed and I was just waiting for the story to wrap up.  Shyamlan's stories a meant to make your mind WORK - so if you're looking for senseless terror this is not the movie for you.  If you want to pause and think 'what if' you will probably enjoy it.<br />I felt that the film was rather lush in it's portrayal of the village - the camera work was great and the actors did an excellent job.
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	...it's because this is the lousiest transfer of film-to-DVD that I have ever purchased.  Each scene, entirely washed out and 'dark'; it's almost like watching it in black and white.  Not the TV, not the settings on the TV, it's just a lousy product ... and I can see from the other reviews that I'm not alone in thinking this.  Ah, well...
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	When I first started Insanity I was wondering what did I get myself into? Well this workout is addicting. I love it. I am on month two and only have a few weeks left. I started seeing results after only a few weeks. I am also watching what I eat too through myfitnesspal.com app. I am down 15 lbs and am to my weight I wanted! I am toned now too. I am 37 yrs old and I have had 4 kids and knew if I didn't change how I ate and didn't try this Insanity workout I was gonna keep gaining weight and that was not what I wanted.<br />I will tell you in the beginning you will have complete muscle fatigue from the beginning...but do not give up! You will feel as if you can't do this but you can! Shaun T is a great motivater too. At first I couldn't keep up with EVERY exercise in Insanity but you improvise and you just do what you can until you work yourself up to their(the fitness people) level in the video. By the end of the first month I was doing most all the exercises and could keep up. The only one I can't keep up with is the push ups..I can do them but not as many. I still push through and do what I can. When I started the second month of Insanity the MAX workouts..boy oh boy..I was so sore all over again..but it is a great soreness knowing I am getting stronger and healthier. I can't wait to finish this and get that t-shirt and I think I am going to try the P90X next. I recommend purchasing a heart rate monitor too. I love mine and now I know how many calories I am burning every time.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	I rented this movie only because it did so well at the Academy Awards.  And granted, Javier Bardem did a great job playing a psychopathic killer in the film.  He no doubt earned his Best Supporting Actor trophy.  But beyond that, the film has little substance and is primarily 2 hours of brutally graphic violence.  As Bardem's character murders one innocent person after another with his crude cattle gun, your thoughts will gradually progress from shock and horror to emotional numbness.  The ending makes no sense and will leave you completely hanging.  I think it's highly debateable whether this film deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture.  I'll no doubt get a lot of unhelpful votes for this review, which is typical for any review that isn't 4 or 5 stars.  But given the fact that approximately 1/3 of the 200+ Amazon reviews for this disc were 3 stars or less, I'm obviously not alone.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	Even though the characters are older, the same zip and mystical charm was here in the movie.  Great family movie especially for kids.
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	There is enough science to satify the mind and eye candy to keep anyone's attention. The science is smart. I was tempted to look up how much power the suit was really generating. I must admit that the shape of the suit would never allow it to compete with supersonic jets, but it was still fun to imagine it. I know that I will watch this one over and over again.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	This movie was great, I loved how it tied everything in that occured from the original story but in a modern way. This was a cliffhanger and SO GOOD!!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	It has been a long time since i saw such a great movie. This movie was excellent. Keeps you interested from beginning to end. There are also surprises which is great. Must see film.
B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	Free and open inquiry is what learning is supposed to be about. It is pathetic that our institutions have sworn allegiance to a theory as weak as Darwinism and excluded everything else. Ben Stein does a very good job in this video of exposing the close-minded ignorance of the so-called academics who rule over higher education. Does anyone with a shred of common sense really believe this wonderful and complex world came from nothing?
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"this was an exciting and inventive movie, with stunning viuals and production, some plot twist and a few surprises wherein we look at Scott's allegorical tale of alien adventurers giving rise to a planet of being for some as yet unknown reason...<br />You have a fearless female heroine enduring all thte hardships one can imagine, ego driven men who are willing to stop at nothing to get what they want, hostile alien worlds, futuristic space travel and exploration, alien intelligence that surpasses that of the humans, an android with sinister programing who is still charming and then you come to the end of the movie....and are completely let down by a director's sophmoric turn and plot device that deliberately shys from the obvious implied by the film and throughout to some giddy school boy ""moral quest"" and ""hope"".<br />Riddley Scott certainly knows how to tell a good tale, to capture the audience however, he does not know how to or when to stop...and so he ruins the whole damn thing.<br />The lesson here is that it is better to quit while you're ahead but he did not do it.<br />I'm not at all certain I will add this to my DVD collection along with the Alien movies, Blade Runner and others.  I was very disappointed."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I am one of the many people that grew up with Harry Potter and loves the books with all my heart, and the movies. I honestly love this one the best! I thought the music was fantastic (I'm sure people will challenge me on that!) and just the way they did everything was perfect! I loved it so much the second time I went to see it in theaters I was more excited than the first time! I don't think part 2 was anywhere near as good as this one, so thank god they split it up because it would have been terrible to have the last movie be bad!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	It's too bad this edition is so hard to find, but unlike what some people have said, I definitely thought the special features were worth it, if you're a fan. They went in-depth about how they made the scene where there are 7 Harrys, which was really cool and interesting. If you don't have a Blu-Ray player, this is worth adding to your Harry Potter movie collection for the sake of the extra disc of features!
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"This was an excellent movie... probably one of Robert Downy Jr.'s best.  Unlike most Blu-ray movies that are older that have been converted to blu-ray, this one (being so new) was meant for Blu-ray.  It is truly incredible in HD.  The colors are so vibrant and you can see ever little detail on our 52"" Sony Bravia.  This is worth every penny!"
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I don't typically go for movies of this nature, but when my 41 year old daughter told me how much she enjoyed it, I decided I should check it out. I concur, it is a great, entertaining movie.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	"I just want to start off by saying that I wanted to like this movie. I really did. However, this film is depressingly skin deep.<br /><br />The good. The camerawork is absolutely stunning, the special effects as well. Your eyes tell you that there is a marvelous film before you, but that is as far as it goes. I have to say, before I start the bashing, that Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth try their absolute hardest making something out of the lines that they are given. Their performances were touching (Theron more so than the rest) and they at least gave some substance to it.  Hemsworth carried most of the film when Theron wasn't in the picture. If it were just a story between the two of them, even with the horrible lines that they were given, it would have been at least a four star film.<br /><br />Now for the bad, and when I say bad, I mean terrible. I never had much of an opinion about Kristen Stewart before this movie. I steadfastly stayed away from Twilight so I thought I had a pretty clean slate to judge going into this. Stewart, who plays Snow White, has been locked in a tower for years only to escape right before the Queen (Theron), who killed her father the King, kills her and takes her heart. Needless to say, after somehow finding this out in a slightly perverted scene, Snow White runs away. Then she runs away again after she loses her magic pony (actually, she abandons him). Then the Huntsman joins in and he runs away with her too. At some point there's a Troll for all of 30 seconds, then scarred women for another minute or so. At about the 1 hour mark we finally meet the dwarves.  Throughout all of this, we maybe get 10 mumbled lines from Stewart. I can't say that this is entirely her fault. It is the writing that is terrible. But then we get to the acting. I swear, every single time Hemsworth spoke to Stewart you could see the pleading in his eyes. It's as if he were trying to say, ""Please, give me some sort of emotion to go on!!"" Alas, Stewart just stares back at him and breathes. Literally.  This is the Snow White we get. A breathing, slightly constipated looking girl who squints off into the distance looking slightly befuddled.  You can almost tell that the director is obsessed with Stewart from all of the closeups you get of her. I mean after about the 20th time I get it. She's beautiful. Now show me something MORE. I mean, Snow White, you were LOCKED AWAY in a TOWER for YEARS after witnessing the DEATH of your FATHER and the FALL of your KINGDOM. Any human being would have had some sort of melt down, but all we get is Stewart, looking beautiful.  Hasn't anyone told these people that looks can only get you so far?<br /><br />It was the wooden lead that sealed it for me. No matter how good the surrounding cast, you need a great lead to carry such a heavy weight of a film. Oh, and let's not forget to mention the patch work editing and dead dialogue that made it even worse. I was literally writhing in pain and hitting my forehead with my fist by the time it ended. Truly, it was pure agony to sit through for anyone who likes backstory and acting.<br /><br />If you want to watch a visually stunning film, this is the movie for you. Before you go watch it though, I strongly suggest that you just mute out the scenes with Stewart, which is most of the film. After all, wasn't it only visual beauty that the director was trying to portray?<br /><br />The fairest of them all truly is only skin deep."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I love this workout!  Ok i have been going to the gym for years and this workout totally wears me out every time! I love it and I burn a ton of calories!
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"This movie was senseless violence with no point. It was a total waste of my evening. I regret spending a single cent to view such garbage. Come on... if you are going to get all ""artsy"" on me, do so... not this rubbish."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Of all the HP movies this one is the best. They should have continued the focus on all of the DA in 6 & 7. I was very disappointed when they didn't show the big fight scene at the end of book 6.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	This is another example of George Lucas getting lost in his own head and ruining a perfect, simple action franchise. The straightforward, world-traveling exploits of Dr. Jones are gone. In their stead is a movie with bland settings, meaningless fights, bad CG, and a leading man who seems like he's delivering his lines at gunpoint.<br /><br />If you love the Indy franchise, and somehow managed not to see this one yet, do yourself a favor: pretend it doesn't exist.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	"The beginning of Cars is a little lame since the beginning race goes on a little too long and it's not either very entertaining or funny. The main car voiced by Owen Wilson isn't that likeable in the beginning. He's self-centered and cocky. The movie gets better when he  gets stuck in a small town and forced to fix a wrecked road there if he wants to leave. If he doesn't leave soon he will miss out being in a big race and becoming the big star he wants to be. The longer he's stuck there though the more he finds that he likes it there and the more he learns to be less self-centered. He also learns to care about other people.....oops, I mean other cars.<br /><br />  At first I only found Cars to be a great movie to look at and nothing else. Then I got more and more into the story and I soon found it to be as good as other big Disney Pixar hits like Toy Story 1 and 2 and The Incredibles and Finding Nemo. Cars is a smart, charming and sometimes even a touching film. Disney missed out for being nominated last year for best animated film ""thanks to Chicken Little being pretty weak"". Cars hopefully won't get ignored when it comes to Oscar time. It looks great and doesn't have a bad story either. The voice actors casted are perfect too. Owen Wilson, Paul Newman and Bonnie Hunt all do fine jobs."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I watched this with two aging race drivers: one a local dirt track champion and the other a former NASCAR Winston Cup driver.  We all loved this movie.  Besides being a high quality animated presentation, my companions pointed out the accuracy and realism regarding the racing episodes and techniques that was evident to them. This movie will be a classic!
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	movie was fast paced, grabbed your attention from the start. editing was good...acting was especially good and very little redundant content. i would watch again, and i think if you rent a movie from amazon, they should create a history for you so if you wanted to rent it a second time, it would be 1.99 HD, rather than paying full price again. what about it amazon, how about gratutity for your faithful customers?
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7F5SS"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Widescreen Edition)</a> Like all the other Harry Potter movies I loved this one. It did start slow but picked up the pace quickly."
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	"...or ""Culturally Dishonest Peepshow Pablum for Suburban Kids,"" couldn't decide on titles for my review.<br /><br />I only wish the charming vamp -was- Paul Rudd so that there might be a tiny shred of wit in the show. Tried to plod through more episodes of this before reviewing to maintain objectivity, but when they let a bout of vampire blood induced priapism in the ""main stud"" plod by without even a shred of any true humor or even one fresh gag, enough was enough.<br /><br />The show is a half-assed attempt to capitalize on vogueish vampire themes and the seemingly insatiable desire of the teenaged/young female market for ""pseudo pornography."" Young ladies, if you want to watch porn, go get some real porn, nothing is stopping you, and you are stunting your own minds as well as anyone's who stumbles across this with your not-so-repressed desires for the rebirth of the ""bodice ripper.""<br /><br />Take a good looking cast of obviously not Southern and obviously not talented actors and see how badly they can mangle Southern accents and Southern cultural cliches... then add vampires, and you have this poor ripoff of the decent movie ""The Gift."" I doubt many Louisiana folks are fans, or at least many who spend their time other than cruising Walmart.<br /><br />It is possible to make a good ""white trash"" show (looking at you, Earl), but requires writing containing lots of legitimate humor, acting talent, heart and soul. This ""wooden stake"" of a show has none of those, none at all."
B001OHS8BQ	3.0	b	I found the message touching.  Not too many movies have a moral let alone a Christian message.  I didn't think the acting was all terrible.  I actually thought Kirk did a decent job.  Some of the others though, well they just did OK, about as good as your local school play.  The lack of quality acting wasn't overly detrimental to the story line.  The comedic moments I thought were over the top.  Goofy more than funny.  My wife and I did laugh quite hard at some of the scenes together.  Many I don't think our response was what the makers intended.  Its not a great movie but the message is good and other than being a little slow, and some not so good acting it was still enjoyable.  Its a movie with a Christian message.  You anti-Christians need to relax.  You don't have to watch it, and I truly doubt anyone on the planet doesn't know about its Christian content.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"I know this one's gotten some bad reviews, professional and amateur alike, but I'd like to say a few words on its behalf.<br /><br />I agree that the plot is a little far-fetched, to start.  I can't deny that.  Mind-control?  Psy warfare?  Aliens from another dimension?  You could have justly titled it Indiana Jones and the Crazy Plot, I admit.  However, most of that comes in near the end, at which point you're hopefully already happily settled into the wild adventure, frantic chases, plot twists, father-son bonding, more chases, and typical Indy humor which this film is chock-full of.<br /><br />The entire opening transition, from kids in a hot rod to a race with military vehicles (my family used to OWN a Ford like that, I swear!), to the revelation about who the ""military"" folks really were, to Indy's appearance, to the Area 51 warehouse, to the alien, and finally through the incredible sequence with the nuclear test has to be one of the best (if not THE best) Indy openings ever.  And it all somehow blends together!  Great editing.  Who could fail to be amused by the familiar gleam of gold in that OTHER crate at the warehouse (tip of the fedora to the first film), or the rocket-sled ride, or Indy's ""Oh, this can't be good at all!"" at the test site, to the landing of the flying fridge?  Great, great stuff.<br /><br />The lengthy sequence at college beginning with the all-too-serious looming threat of McCarthyism and ending with the fantastic motorcycle chase also had many great moments.  Being chased by the KGB through an anti-Communist rally?  And what about the kid in the library asking Professor Jones, lying next to motorcycle on floor, a question about his Anthro homework?  Terrific.  I was impressed by Shia LeBoeuf as his son, he somehow managed to suggest what a real offspring of Indy and Marion would be like.<br /><br />And Marion herself...so great to see Karen Allen back in an Indy movie.  The resolution of their abruptly-terminated relationship through a series of spats and back to the old love and affection was a really heartwarming aspect to the movie, as well as a funny one.  I admit I had a little sympathy for their Russian guard who begged them to ""Shut up!"" in the back of the truck.<br /><br />The entire action sequence on the way to Akator, racing through the jungle on a variety of vehicles and using a variety of weapons on one another, was another action high-point.  A swordfight between people in two high-speed vehicles?  What about the wonderful Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko wielding her sword against Mutt, criticizing his technique as that of a ""young man eager to start but finishing too soon?""  Cate was definitely a fine villain and a high point of the film as well.<br /><br />I'll admit that things became a bit more absurd and confused near the end (surviving THREE falls from waterfalls?  The endless crosses, double-crosses, and triple-crosses of his buddy Mac?  The whole ""interdimensional beings with a flying saucer"" concept?), you can't deny it was a wild finish.  The postscript, the wedding (finally!) between Indy and Marion, was a nice conclusion, finishing the film on an up-note.<br /><br />I still put this film third, behind the first film and ""Last Crusade,"" but I put it close behind those two and WAY ahead of the ridiculous ""Temple of Doom.""  Well-worth seeing, whatever the purists say about it."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I loved this movie when I saw it in theatres and couldn't wait to get it.  I bought a ps3 which opened my world to blu-ray.  I own a few blu-rays and this is by far the one with the best quality picture that I own.  Also the audio was great through my surround sound. Over all an excellent blu-ray and I highly recommend it!
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	This was a novel interpretation of the Fairy Tale - not as dark as the original Grimm, but certainly not the sweet interpretation of Disney.  It was fun to watch, particularly to see how they wove in the traditional story elements we all expect to see in a Snow White story.  A fun evening.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	I think that the majority of the people claiming to be disappointed by this film are trying to hard to force it in to the Alien franchise, and/or had such a defined picture of what the movie was going to be in their minds that they couldn't help but be disappointed. No problem there for me; I didn't know what to expect and don't really care about the Alien series (though I do respect the ground that Ridley Scott broke with the first film). I am a huge Blade Runner fan though, and I think that this film is more in tune with that film than the aforementioned series. Gorgeous cinematography: unique and inventive shots one after another, edited with such style and lyricism, wonderful acting, etc. Prometheus is one of the greatest pieces of science fiction (perhaps art in general) ever conceived, and I think someday might be considered Scott's masterpiece. Only time will tell...
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	"I had heard a lot about this film, especially within the Christian community, but I must say that I was rather skeptical. So, I checked out some reviews on-line and finally decided to rent this film so I could see for myself.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much because I had heard of the low-production values of the film and the cast of ""non-actors"" who graciously volunteered their time to portray many of the supporting characters.<br /><br />I was really surprised to find this to be a wonderful film. The acting is not TERRIBLE, though there are a few lines/scenes that can make a film-lover cringe. Even Kirk Cameron is a little over-the-top during some scenes and there were also a couple of scenes that ""tried too hard"" to be ""funny"". Regardless, this film has so much heart and a fantastic message, that I was willing to overlook the minor flaws.<br /><br />Every married couple should view this film, whether they are having marital problems or not. The message behind this little gem of a film rings true, even to those who currently enjoy a happy marriage. Who better to look to than God for the keys to a happy marriage than the creator of marriage himself? If more people lived their lives this way, divorce rates would be virtually non-existant.<br /><br />Some have criticised that this movie is nothing more than ""Christian propaganda"".<br /><br />Nonsense.<br /><br />I realize that there are many agnostics and athiests as well as non-Christians who will probably avoid this film like the plague because of the origin of its ""message"", and these are probably the ones who are out there lambasting it.<br /><br />If you've already decided you're going to hate this film before you even watch it, then there is nothing here that I or anyone else can say to change your mind. So be it.<br /><br />The extras offered on the disc are also quite entertaining and inspiring. The ""goof"" reels and the practical joke reels are pretty funny as well.<br /><br />Give this film a try. You won't be disappointed."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Harry potter and the deathly hallows part 1 rocks. Can't wait for part 2.  I love harry potter and I got my kids into it too so now we have something special to share. It's a must see series of movies and a must read series of books. I'm both excited and depressed with the last of the series almost upon us.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	I thought the movie while good, was a little on the slow side. I hope that the last one will have much more action and move a bit more.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	i just finished watching this movie and let me tell you it was something else!theres near naked chicks the whole way through which wouldve kept me going right there,but then theres lots of blood and guts too!talk about double prizes!it is black and white mostly which im sure a lot of people will whine about,but a lot of good movies are black and white so dont be so stupid!there is color in certain parts,which is neat.one thing i did not like was how the characters are shot repeatedly or lethaly[at least debilitatingly] and are up and fighting in like 30 seconds.did i miss something?do they regenerate?bulletts only hurt a little bit?its very grapgicly violent and not for you hippie bleeding heart liberalistsw out there,so go watch dazed and confused for the millionth time and leave your protest groups to something worth fighting over.the movie is masterfully directed by quenten tarantino.so you know theres a lot of blood and guts in it!theres more than one creepy part so i suggest only those with a good tolerance for violence and lifetime type drama go see it.its a cool movie.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	So informative!!  Finally, some truth about our foods and the dangers it can cause.  I love this movie!!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I'm biased.  I'm Christian and I care greatly about having a fantastic marriage, so I loved this movie.  Granted, the acting isn't great, the special effects aren't mind-blowing, and the dialogue is preachy at times.  But it had some invaluable lessons that anyone, not just a Christian, could incorporate into any love relationship to strengthen it.
B001684L0A	1.0	b	McCullough's excellent book is poorly treated in this mini-series. After watching the series you have no clue of what Addams or the founding fathers accomplished.<br /><br />Addams and Hamilton are particularly poorly portrayed, you have have no clue to Addams fiery nature or Hamilton's financial dynamo and the impact they had on the creation of the country.<br /><br />The series is ultimately boring because it give us no insight into the great accomplishment that was the lives of these men and women.<br /><br />Much like the movie Ray at the end we have not yet seen what made John Addams great. Read McCullough's book or Ron Chernow's Hamilton, they give a sense of great adventure and accomplishment of these men.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Great movie, wonderful and realistic solution this happens daily with couples . but the solution is jesus christ John 3:16 make it personal
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	This film is simply asking this question.  Why can't we have all the differing viewpoints out there for real discussion.  If the evolutionary scientists are as open-minded as they claim, why not hear all sides and teach all sides and then let the individual decide which he chooses to believe in.  If this is a free country then why does tyranny dictate our education?  If we are to be well-informed people, we should know what we are talking about when we make our arguments.  Let all sides be heard!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie is definitely a must-see for every couple!  It is a low budget film, and Kirk Cameron is certainly the only big actor in it, but the message is incredible.  I've had people tell me that they were sure that they were filming their marriage when they made this movie!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"This program is absolutely amazing!  Before beginning, I considered myself pretty fit, working out 5-6 days a week doing several cross training exercises (swimming, biking, running).  This program completely kicked my butt!  Shaun T. was very encouraging and he made the workouts fun.  It was also great to see others in the video who had already completed the program stopping to take breaks.  I do think there are a couple important notes to make though:<br />1) Others have said it, but seriously, if you have any kind of joint problems, do NOT use this program!  Not being prone to injury, I still often noticed that my knees were sore after a lot of the jumping exercises.<br />2) Sure, doing these workouts will help you get in better shape, but if you really want to see results, you must follow the nutrition plan closely.  I used to be in the school of ""eat whatever you want in moderation,"" but still ate fairly healthy (with a healthy amount of splurging).  I had stubborn spare tire fat that just would not go away.  I started doing research into this nutrition plan, and it is definitely solid.  And the best part is that you have choices for each of your meals, so you're not stuck eating the same thing every day, and you aren't forced to spend $50 a day on groceries.  I usually picked out the foods I wanted to eat that week, and I'd stick to a particular food for my breakfast or mid-morning snack each day for the week (e.g. cottage cheese with fruit) to ensure I could buy one tub and have it last me the whole week, and also make sure I ate it before it went bad.  These foods also helped give me the energy I needed to do these workouts, especially in the second month.<br /><br />Overall, this program is freaking INSANE.  If you want something to kick your butt into shape, I highly recommend it.  I plan on continuing to use these workouts regularly to help me maintain.  Hope this helps!"
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	This like ever other Harry Potter movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughtout the whole movie.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is one of the best videos I have ever seen.  My husband and I read the John Adams book by David McCullough and this follows it very good although there are some parts missing.  You need several days to watch the video, but it is absolutely wonderful!  The actors playing John Adams and Abigail Smith Adams should receive an Academy Award!  They were exquisite.  Tom Hanks was the producer and it really showed his expertise.  Anyone who likes history, and our American history especially needs to see this video.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This product is the best thing out there..yes p90x is a great workout but comparing both of this products you get more for your money with insanity than p90x..and the results are incredible!!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham has out done himself.  Totally laugh out loud funny.  All ages have sat with me and laughed.  definitaly recommend it
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	this video was so funny we were crying from laughing.  He is great!!!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Everyone should see this movie!  We need more movies like this which speak to the values that made this country great!
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	Great HP story, lousy DVD quality. I'll be calling Warner on Monday to complain.  In the mean time, I'll be returning what appears to be an extremely poorly compressed DVD to the store for a replacement.  I don't expect any difference in quality, but the stores need to know. Even my home video DVD's look better than this.  Maybe I should see if I can find HP OOTP on VHS. It certainly would look better than the DVD.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5LEXS"">Jeff Dunham - Arguing With Myself</a><br /><br />This dvd is hilarious. I have ordered over 10 of them and given them away for gifts.  Great Gift for someone who needs a good giggle :)"
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	First off, let me say that this is NOT my kind of movie.  I'm more into zombies, slashers, and movies of the horror genre.  My Husband is into the same genre as myself but once he saw bits of this movie on PPV he figured we'd enjoy it to some degree since it had guns, murder, and all that kind of stuff, HE WAS RIGHT!  I'll also say, yes, it does have violence but it offers SO MUCH MORE.  I REALLY enjoyed this film.<br /><br />It takes you back to 1980, a MUCH simpler time, yet a time of enormous change.  The entire movie was symbolic (to me.)  There were many parts that IMO, showed the contrast of good and evil, and the times changing ever so much.<br /><br />Bottom line, the movie was made well, no Hollywood bologna effects etc.. The acting was great, BRAVO!  The plot was very entertaining/realistic and kept my attention 100%.  The movie overall was fantastic.  If you like explosives, crazy car chases, women with obvious breast implants, sex scenes aplenty, goofy acting, poor plot, and special effects to fill in the gap for the lack of a thought provocing scipt, then this movie is NOT for you.  If you're looking for GREAT simple yet strong type of movie with a big message and awesome plot, you've found the right movie for you.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I thought this movie was very well-done and executed. of course it could spend time COMPLETELY delving into the whole discussion but I thought it addressed it's main subject; the denial of freedom to those within the scientific community to express an idea that differs from the status quo. I think anyone with an open mind who watches this movie can see that differing ideas are being suppressed and not respected. Kudos to you Ben Stein for having the guts to make a movie like this. Of course there will be those who attack you (and those like you) just like is stated in your film. But perhaps, it may cause a decent amount of awareness on the whole subject.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	"Problem: When one speaks of ""beauty"", people tend to forget that ""beauty"" is both external and ""internal"". Perhaps Snow White's purity created her overall beauty. Charlize is one of those rare women who seem to ""glow"" with little or no effort. There was one movie, she played a roadside pro, (maybe ""Beast"") in love with another woman... they had to go to great lengths to make her (Charlize) look that bad. Beauty is not skin deep.<br />Perhaps Chalize's character realized that she did indeed, need both.<br /><br />Overall, anyone can pick at the little things ""that annoyed them"" about the film. And some insist on writng disertations. I wish people would only review the overall ""quality""of the entire movie. Don't spoil it for others who have not seen it, by critiquing nearly all of the important (or not) scenes.<br /><br />It was an adventure and it managed to pull the more important emotions from me. That and it's quality, overall, made for an entertaining film. I would heartily recommend it to any adult. Enough so, that I will add it to my movie library.<br />Opal"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	we ordered them both and already watched them quit a few times my son knows the jokes by head. Really a good buy
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"I love Jeff Dunham and ""his personalities"" have seen him in person and have both his DV'ds. He is great fun, and the best type of comedy out there. It's almost scarey he is so good, he pulls you in. You almost relate to the puppets as real! They all become your favorites. My uncle looks like Walter so I practically pee my pants in laughter. Peanut ""you just cant help but love him!! Dunham is great, you want your family and friends to laugh and enjoy the best of comedy watch Jeff Dunham. I think he is one of the best and cant wait for MORE insanity and new characters.<br />Ordering this item on Amazon.com was very easy and came to my front door<br />amazingly fast!"
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I received this DVD lightning fast!  It packed well and was delivered in perfect shape.  The movie was a lot of fun to watch and the blu-ray quality was breathtaking! I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action flicks or comic book based heros. It is one of my favorites!
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	I honestly didn't know what it was about when I bought it but it turned out to be a pretty good movie.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	These insanity videos were lots of fun and made me sweat the first few minutes into every vidoe.  Very hard in the beginning..  lots of fun.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"Anyone who eats anything, should see this movie. If you think you do not have an impact in this world, watch this film and then ""vote"" by sending a message to food manufacturers next time you are in the supermarket. This should make America rethink what we put in our mouths!"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	To be honest, I thought I was going to hate this film.  I detest NASCAR, and would prefer to ride the bus - if my city would actually have a functioning bus line.  I was honestly surprised at the depth of character development and plot focus that was evident in this movie.  My son like the movie for the race cars (artfully done btw).  I liked the movie for the cultivation of a hero.  There weren't many (obviously) kissy-face scenes that my nine year old would pronounce *GROSSSS*, but the sweet sentiments were still there.  The artwork was fantastic.  And as someone who has lived on Rt. 66, the essence of plain, honest, living comes across beautifully.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Movie - 4.5<br /><br />Gangster movies were not something I watched a lot of, at least as a kid. All the grit, violence, drama, complexities, etc. were way over my head. But in growing up, I came to acquire a taste for these things and eventually learned to like them a lot. I still haven't seen any of the Godfather movies, but I've recently been catching up on Scorsese. And in being one of the few that's actually seen and can appreciate Infernal Affairs (the original inspiration for The Departed), I have to say I was pretty excited after initially hearing Scorsese was attached to direct this Western adaption. When I first saw The Departed on DVD some years ago, I'd never seen a whole Scorsese film in any kind of entirety, but I knew his films by name and heard he was a great director. After finally watching his most renowned work in Goodfellas, I could see why he earned such praise. With that said, upon this subsequent viewing of the The Departed I definitely like it a lot more than I did initially. It's the story of two moles: a gangster in the police and a cop in the mob. The two work their opposing bosses into trusting them, but the bosses are on to the fact that there is, indeed, an enemy mole within their own outfits. Violence, deception, drama, and thrills ensue as each mole gets closer to finding the other. In terms of comparison, I'd have to say Infernal Affairs makes for a more entertaining and fast-paced story with its kinetic score and attention to subtlety in both narrative and characters for the viewer to fill in on their own (along with 50 minutes less in running time). On the other hand, Scorsese does a wonderful job in making his version more of a character drama with the elements of the aforementioned on the side and set on the mean streets of South Boston that works very well, though tends to feel a bit cumbersome and underwhelming at times (like the love triangle, the lack of empathy for Nicholson's character compared to his Chinese counterpart, or the overuse of record label songs as opposed to an actual score). However, the film more than makes up for these shortcomings through a wonderful script and some excellent performances with an A-list cast, particularly Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, and a very foul-mouthed (though funny to listen to) Mark Wahlberg. Both are excellent movies in their own right that should cater to either side of the spectrum depending your preference for flash and execution vs. grit and progression, though I'd personally lean a little more towards the original just because it doesn't feel as tedious in certain aspects.<br /><br />Video - 4.5<br /><br />For being one of the flagship BDs from Warner Brothers' early days into HD home video, the video quality actually looks pretty good. Compared to other flagship titles released from around the same time, in which some of them do or don't still hold up to today's standards, The Departed presents itself very well. The first thing that caught my eye during Nicholson's little prologue speech were the black levels and shadow delineation. As you see his silhouette walking through with a white background behind him, it instantly set the tone for me and made for some lovely foreshadowing to the film's narrative about the deceit, secrets, and hiding to occur throughout. Colors aren't very bold, and are even a bit drab, but still manage to put some real-world depth into the picture making the audience know full well that the grit and dirtiness are there. Blues, grays, and blacks tend to stick out the most in the form of police uniforms, gangster attire, and various low-lit settings, while red tends to show themselves a bit more towards the end when people start getting off'd. Contrast is also excellent and helps to accentuate some very fine textures and facial features from the creases in shirts and lining in suits to the stubble of unshaven mob goons and the wrinkles under their eyes. Overall image detail has a great deal of clarity and sharpness with near-reference quality outside of some artifacts and debris that pop up on occasion and the every-so-often instance of overly red skin tones. But all things considered, audiences should be pleased with the picture quality and that it didn't end up as badly botched as say.. Batman Begins or V for Vendetta was.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />Using that memory-eater of a codec in Uncompressed PCM , The Departed outputs at a constant bitrate of 4.6Mbps and sounds just as excellent as one could hope. The movie starts off silent and fades into Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter at a very adequate volume that gives the film some ambiance, but never overpowers Nicholson's opening speech. Dialogue throughout remains clear and discernible from the center channel, and I was very.. amused at how well I could understand those Bostonian accents (still had to turn the subtitles on, just to be safe). Directionality is a bit sparse, but does take advantage of the clarity of lossless audio by giving off some very fine subtleties in sound effects like the opening and closing of doors, the churning of cars plodding down the street, the ringing of telephones across the room, and the approaching footsteps of people off screen. Music varies between a lot of cuts of Gimme Shelter and Dropkick Murphys' I'm Shipping Up to Boston and a little bit of score from Howard Shore here and there. For the most part, it's a fairly music-less sound scape with the dialogue doing most of the work, though gunshots and fist fights make themselves known when need be. Separation is handled perfectly between all of these elements with a lot of the music staying in the front and guns and punches panning between the fronts and rears, most notably during a raid scene towards the end. The only downside to this audio presentation is the lack of any potent LFEs, which obviously don't have very many moments to shine aside from some bass in the music, but it's still a fine movie without them.<br /><br />Extras - 3.5<br /><br />With just over 45 minutes of special features, there are two of them presented: one talking about infamous Southie gangster Whitey Bulger (whom Nicholson's character is based on), and another featurette talking about Scorsese's history in film as well as his previous experiences in the gangster genre. The Whitey Bulger segment adds an intriguing sense of realism. There are various interviews with news correspondents, former law enforcement officials, and even former mob men that talk about the scope and influence of Bulger, the power he possessed for almost 30 years, and a little bit of the of stigma a person like him carried around. I'm still a bit new to the gangster genre myself and found this to be a pretty cool piece of information. It wasn't overly factual, but still managed to tell me enough that I could relate it to the movie and give it a more objective view. The Scorsese ""portfolio"" segment was a very great watch. Like I said, I'm just now getting into him as a director and it fascinates me to learn about his history growing up, the kinds of films he made, and a lot of the similarities and influences those works share with one another. I see him as being quite charismatic, and I'm a bit disappointed they didn't include a commentary of some sort for the movie itself. Then finally, there are also deleted scenes in SD with introductions for each one. All in all, there aren't a lot of specials in terms of quantity, but I personally enjoyed them for the outright quality.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />The Departed is a fine adaptation of Infernal Affairs that really works for western audiences. It's not as flashy or well-executed in terms of screenplay, but it makes up for those losses in gritty atmosphere and more fleshed-out characters. And who better to portray this than a man who's certainly becoming one of my favorite directors in Martin Scorsese. I was shocked that he never won an Oscar prior to this film, but I'm glad to see he got his just due at some point. If you like cop/gangster thrillers, this would probably be near the top of my recommendations (though I would also say you try Infernal Affairs if you don't mind subtitles). With excellent video and audio specs and a good amount of informative extras, The Departed comes highly recommended."
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	All around weak, like a watered down decaf coffee.<br />They try some good special effects but doesnt make up for horrible character development and characters in general.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	I thought this movie was good, although it is my least favorite out of the five.<br /><br />The special effects, as always, were great and the acting was also done at the level of the other movies.<br /><br />It is worth seeing.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Some people think ventriloquists are cute or novel, but they would never actually want to go to a show with one. It's time to reevaluate your love of puppets, or not.<br /><br />I've seen a few of Jeff's acts and he's funny on his own. Add in some interesting characters and turn Jeff into the straight man and not your talking. This DVD is full of his best stuff:<br /><br />Walter - ""Shut the hell up!"" Funny, insulting, jerk of an old man who Jeff continually apologizes for.<br /><br />Peanut - ""Nnneeyroww!"" The funniest part of the show. It almost seems like he's improvising the whole thing as he goes.<br /><br />Jose Jalepeno - ""On a steek."" The banter between him and Peanut is priceless.<br /><br />Bubba J - I think this guy was made to cash in on the Blue Collar Comedy hype. Funny, but not Jeff's best work.<br /><br />Sweet Daddy Dee - Also meant to cash in on the Kings of comedy tour. Funny, but not to die for. He also makes commentary throughout the DVD which was entirely unnecessary.<br /><br />Bloopers - I was at the second show and he picked the best of the improve stuff, but I wish he had put it all in. He never is out of character. Never.<br /><br />So to sum up: Jeff is brilliantly hilarious. Walter, Peanut & Jose are funny. Bubba & Sweet are not. Bloopers are worth it. Buy, buy, buy."
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"My wife probably liked the movie more than I did but I am not really an avid movie watcher. It was nice to have the movie available as a streaming through the Amazon service because, while more expensive than retail rentals, it's on demand and convenient. I found the movie to be quite a switch from the old cartoon versions but I'm sure that it was supposed to be. It was kinda dark and eerie. The acting was VERY good. I don't know that I would nominate ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" for any kind of awards as best movie of the year but I sat through it and I give it a good solid 4-star review for the acting, plot and special effects. With that said, however, it's definitely not a kid's movie."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This flick blew me away. A friend of mine collected the comic books and I never checked them out.  But every week, we had to go to the comic store to get the latest issue.  The movie is totally awesome with the affects and the big name actors in it. Sorry, but right now, all I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	I am very disappointed in WB for not putting out the extended editions.<br /><br />To put the record straight, THERE IS AN EXTENDED CUT OF GOBLET OF FIRE!!!  Every time I watch ABC's Harry Potter weekend they add about 3-4 (or so, never counted) minutes of footage (i.e. Snape in the grounds during the Yule Ball talking with Karkarov and busting a couple in a car, Durmstrang students asking Hogwarts girls to the Yule Ball and bowing, etc)<br /><br />So why is ABC family allowed to show this version if the director said he didn't want to do a director's cut?  He obviously already made one and these versions will be released in a year or two once the Potter Series wraps up and WB feels the need to milk a few extra bucks from the franchise.<br /><br />Nothing in Prison of Azkaban, and I am all good with that, but to not release an extended cut of Goblet or Order when we know the footage is out there is insulting.<br /><br />It's like the Special Extended Editions of Lord of the Rings, or Star Wars on dvd when George Lucas said he would never release the original versions on dvd, i bought the special editions, then two years later had to double-dip to buy the regular editions.<br /><br />Why are the studios so intent on robbing us all blindly?  I own over 200 blu-rays, the format is really only 4-5 years old, and they're already doing re-releases on some of the title I bought a few years ago.  I feel ripped off, and I'm getting sick of it.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"......Because you'll laugh so hard you'll mess your pants!<br /><br />  I became a Fully devoted fan of Dunham and Walter when they<br /><br />  made several tv appearances on TNN's early days when Ralph Emory (with Shotgun Red) were co-hosting Prime Time Country) and then later when Gary Chapman took over hosting duties.<br /><br />  Jeff Dunham IS Hil-ARIOUS! and Walter has his own brand of<br /><br />  (I'll run you down with my car) sense of skeptical humor about the insanities of the human condition.. you can't help but find yourself smiling as He ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.<br /><br />  MY total All out favorite on this program though was Peanut!<br /><br />  Only once before have I laughed so hard I cried. (Robin Williams Live at the Met) was the other time. Talk about Side-splitting laughter! I laughed so hard at jeff's antics and interaction with Peanut (who accuses Jeff outright of selling his Crack)/however this is TOTALLY a *Family* funny show.<br /><br /> Peanut seems like a schiztoid on speed--but in a good and Wildly funny way. (We should wonder why his nickname isn't ""Wild thang?"" Overall... I think anyone who wants a great laugh DEFINITELY SHOULD BUY THIS DVD. If there were More stars than 5 for the rating scale, I'd say ""Arguing with myself"" was Surely--<br /><br /> OFF THE CHARTS HILARIOUS!"
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is very funny; I love his shows! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh. There is just a bit of vulgar language, so be careful around children.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	This had all of the possibilities of another great Indiana Jones movie.  The startup was very good, and the plot was looking interesting.  Then in plopped Shia LaBoef.  His character, although mildly interesting, was pretty useless.  The quest was good with all of the usual fighting on cars stuff.  Unfortunately it ends with a ridiculous reincarnation of the long dead aliens when the skull is returned.  It was worth watching, but not of the some quality as the Harrison Ford and Sean Connery team.  Karen Allen was very good in her supporting role.  Cate Blanchett and her role were over-rated.  Harrison Ford delivered, but the story faded to fantasy-land.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham has got to be the greatest ventriloquist ever. This has got to be one of the funniest comedy shows i've ever seen. I'm very glad i bought it.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	What an interesting twist on an established Fairy tale. If it's one thing I  have always been inpressed with is, originality, and for me this one hits the mark . However ,make no mistake this tale is not for children of a young age, it's dark and bruding at times. The acting is great and there are some outstanding spectacular visual effects. If I could tweek it a bit,I might just make it a bit shorter.To sum it up,I must say I really enjoyed it.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"Yep not slumdog or milk but fireproof.  I have seen many review slams of this film people (that think they are more cultured than me) who have never seen it.  What are they fearful of?....a pro-marriage film??  Tells you alot. I'm not the best christian but I do know that if we lose Marriage....you can kiss societal structure goodbye.....nothing from Govt can replace it....sorry lib ""progressives"" and sorry RINO's.<br /><br />So I say bring on the quality pro-family pro-marriage pro-life pro-liberty(and pro-gun) films.<br />Thank God we have a freemarket/libertarian-like independant choice of films that doesnt get channeled out of the ""group think"" sheep from Hollywood!!!<br /><br />Good job Kirk and crew.....keep pushing!!"
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	"I've been a fan of Alan Ball since <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEVZBW"">Six Feet Under</a>, so I had to watch this. I never read the books, but plan on it, knowing it's different from the series a bit, according to other reviewers.<br /><br />This show hasn't been released on DVD yet, and people have been reviewing it since the first episode. I've seen them all, especially the 12th one, and am very excited about what's been going on. Alan Ball has another hit on his hands. I have no doubt that the DVD release will have tons of goodies for fans.<br /><br />My only gripe is with the cliffhanger at the end...why do that? CSI did it (as I'm sure many other shows have), and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OTU"">Deadwood</a> did it too (to be fair, Deadwood was cancelled after the 3rd Season, and a shame too!)! You make people crawl the walls in suspence and then leave them hanging there. I'm sorry, Alan. I blame you for this since you wrote & directed the last episode.<br /><br />Overall, though, it's a really great show that adds a new flavor to the vampire world, something I haven't seen before. And it's got a really neat opening theme too!!"
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	Thanks for a great transaction.  The movie shipped fast, and came with wrapping on.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	My husband has not read the book series and he loves this show.  We never miss an episode and I can't wait until 6/14 - when season 2 begins.<br />My co-workers and I were reading this series before the TV show came out.  It was like we were in competition, every morning we would get together a chat about the book series.  Then the show came out and we did the same thing, every morning we would grab coffee and chat about the show.  It made waiting for the 9 book easier.  If you haven't read the book series get them today.  If you haven't watched this series - get caught up before season 2 begins you will not be disappointed.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is extremely talented and outrageously funny. I highly recommend this DVD to young and old alike.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My oldest son could not get enough of cars.  The DVD we had was worn out so I was excited to get the blu-ray/dvd combo.  We watch blu-ray mostly at home and then save our DVD's for the car.  We can't wait for Cars 2 to be out at the theater!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I have seen this movie probably a hundred times, since my 2 year old son just LOVES it ! But what can I say, I still get a kick out of this show. It is so funny and the animations look even better on the big TV screen with the blu-ray format. The extras are ok.<br />I mutch rather watch this show over and over again, than some creepy children's show with smiling, happy, singing children and dancing dinosaurs....
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"THIS MOVIE ROCKED!!!  This is absolutely the best movie in the the past 5 years, let alone 2006.  There's something seriously wrong if Scorsese & crew don't sweep at the Oscar's this year.  Everything about this movie was awesome.  From the cast (Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, ""Marky Mark"" Walhberg, Vera Farmiga, Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, & of course Jack Nicholson), their performances (Jack Nicholson was born to play this part, & Vira Farmiga deserves alot more attention as an ""A"" list star), the story & of course the direction.<br /><br />Because everyone and their mother have already gone over the plot, I'll skip that.  For those that don't know, ""The Departed"" is based on the 2004 Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"".  Alot of people were skeptical that Scorsese wouldn't be able to come threw & pull off the film.  Scorsese took it, made it his own, & knocked it right out of the ball park.  There's not one dull moent all the way threw.  The action, comedy, drama, intense violence, & the suspense keep you totally strapped into your seat from beginnnig to end.<br /><br />As for the people complaining about the violence & language...  What were you expecting?  Have you not seen any of Scorsese's other work?  Did the ""R"" rating not clue you into what was in store?  Ya, this movies really bloody.  The violence isn't cartoony, it's real, intense, & horrifying, the way it should be in a movie.  If you don't want that, I'm sure you can just as easily go catch the latest Walt Disney money machine.<br /><br />Anyway, I'll step down off my soap box.  Just go see, buy or rent this movie.  This film will go down as not only true classic, but also as one of Scorsese's finest."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"Oh how dimwitted yet incredibly intelligent Ron can be at times, as the above statement shows. He understands that the war that Voldomort has waged isn't just about Harry. Yes, he is a huge factor; but not the whole reason. And this film really starts to show us just how big this ""war"" has become. Reaching so far as to take over the ""secure"" and ""powerful"" Ministry of Magic, and even taking over the sacred halls of Hogwarts itself.<br /><br />But, Harry is still a large part of the war. He is the figure that the good stand behind now that the thought to be immortal Dumbledore is no more.  And with that knowledge, so this film begins. Dumbledore is dead, and Harry is left clueless as to what he is to do with the fragments of knowledge that were left to him. He knows he must destroy the remaining Horocruxes; magical items housing split pieces of Voldomorts soul, keeping him immortal. But what are these items, how do you destroy them, and most importantly how do you find them. This is the main focus of Part 1. After realizing that he is not safe anywhere he goes, Harry with his trusted friends Ron and Hermione go on the run to find these remaining objects and learn how to destroy them.<br /><br />Deathly Hallows is one of the most well structured films of the series to date. Many things that the amazing J.K. Rowling wrote in the novel would have weighed the film version down and made it feel disjointed, but Steve Kloves has done a magical job at finding the root story, and side stories that are relevant to this. He has also given us one of the most emotional scripts, delivered with true and powerful performances by all; particularly by our core three. Daniel, Emma and Rupert have truly become amazing actors/actresses. So many scenes in this film are very depressing and filled with tension and all three deliver. Small additions also make the film all that much more amazing. The dance that Harry and Hermione share after Ron abandons the cause, is truly heart felt and sweet.<br /><br />But the action and set design are also astounding. The opening chase sequence with the multiple Harry's being chased by the death eaters through the skies and streets of London was amazing and intense. And the infiltration of the Ministry to steal one of the horocruxes is ingenious and while funny, very intense as well, and also gives us the chance to once again see the amazing Imelda Staunton as the ever nasty Dolores Umbridge. The chase between the snatchers and the trio near the end of the film is also very intense.<br /><br />Giving props to Daniel, Emma and Ron is commendable but the supporting cast is also amazing. Ray Fiennes as Voldomort is as always creepy and nasty as Voldomort. And Alan Rickman; although underused; steals every scene his character Severus Snape is in. But I must say that the stand out in this film to me was Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange who played the role with such cunning and murderous venom that she stole each and every scene she was in. Her torturing of Hermione was a terrifying scene to hear and behold.<br /><br />Death is also a major theme in this film, we loose several loved characters and many people are scene dead or worse in the film, so to all those thinking of taking their little kids, I'd say no. The film is very dark and morbid, and has a very forboding sense of dread hanging over it. This is not Chamber of Secrets or even Order of the Phoenix.<br /><br />I was immensely satisfied with this film, even if it was incomplete, but it is a step in the right direction. I have been, unlike some, very impressed with the last few films, enjoying the more mature and tense filled films.<br />With Half Blood Prince being my favorite to date, even better in my opinion than this one. So if your wanting to see a truly gripping film than go see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	As a reformed comic book collector, I had never read any of Frank Miller's Sin City graphic novels but I had heard about them. And everything that I had heard had been positive. Then when I heard they were making a film based on a few of the novels and the it was being directed by Robert Rodriguez I was very interested in what would happed. But what really sold me on the film was hearing that Frank Miller himself would be co-director of the film. To think the man behind it all, the creator, would be involved in the film gave me very high hopes. Well after seeing the film I was not disappointed. This is one of the slickest pieces of film making I have seen in a long time. I love how the film is done all in black and white with color being used only when neccesary, mostly in the case of blood or the color of a character's eyes. The film reminds me very much of portions of the graphic novel that I have seen. In fact the whole film seems like the graphic novels come to life. The way each stories weaves in and out of each other reminds me of a comic book. This film has one of the most diverse casts I have seen. A unique blend of both old school actors (Rutger Hauer/Bruce Willis/Powers Boothe) and up an coming stars (Alexis Bledel/Jessica Alba/Rosario Dawson). But the stand out actor in this film has to be Mickey Rourke as Marv. At first you don't even recognize that it is Mickey ROurke but as the story proceeds you realize that it isn't Mickey Rourke, not anymore. Because he has truly become Marv and plays him well. It is as if Rourke identifies with the character which more than explains why he plays him so well. But I want to tell you this film is not for young children. It is a very violent film and contains nudity. In fact a friend of mine who is a die hard horror fan rented this film at my recommendation and did not finish it because she felt it was too violent. But do not let the violence scare you away from this film. It is all part of the plot and does not come across as unecessary. In fact it is integral in telling each story. I highly recommend this film and you will not be disappointed and I am looking forward to a sequel.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	Once again Hollywood insults the viewing public by trying to win them over with special affects alone. Everything from the directing the writing and the acting was sub-par at best. I had hoped for more but was left wanting.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"""Cars"" is a slickly-produced, delightful animated movie.  The main character is Lightning McQueen, the self-centered, sassy young car whose goal is to displace veteran cars and win the coveted Piston Cup, the pinnacle of car racing.  When he finishes the big race in a dead heat with two other cars, he qualifies for a re-run of the race in California.  On his way to the race, McQueen falls out of his transport van and ends up in the small town of Radiator Springs on Route 66.  While he's there, McQueen learns what it's like to work as part of a team and to really care about people.  We watched this DVD as three generations, and there was something to appeal to everyone.  Grandpa and Gran were impressed with the rendering of the cars from the 50's and 60's, Mom and Dad loved the story, and the grandkids enjoyed the action and the loveable characters.  This is great family entertainment!"
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I sat and watched this movie with my six year old granddaughter and both of us walked away with a smile.  Do you believe in Santa Claus? Have you lost the faith of your childhood and the simply joy of believing? Life deals us with some rough blows, times are often more hard than easy and sometimes hopelessnss is much easier to give into than faith.<br /><br />  This movie is about believing, it is about faith, love, hope. It isn't so much about believing in Santa Claus but its more about believing in something that you can hold onto. I think it was well done, characters were wonderful, visual great; I loved it all as did my granddaughter.  If you have not seen this movie yet do yourself a favor and watch it with someone you love.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is the funniest DVD I've ever seen.  Jeff Dunham raises the bar for comedians.  This would make a great gift for adults who like comedy.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	In case you're wondering, the aforementioned 'suckers' are anybody who paid to see this movie..and i dont mean just in a theater...i count myself in because it cost me $3.79 at my video store.. looking back, i should have given that money to a homeless person...then went home and stared at a wall while playing suspenseful music....i would have gotten the same effect of watching an M Night movie...<br /><br />This GUY SUCKS!!  Seriously, his talent level should place him as a writer for the SCI-FI channel...maybe he could write a few decent outer limits or twilight zone episodes??..but he is in over his head when it comes to big-budget movies...and where the F did the budget go?  Has the the price of 'monster suits' (signs anyone?) increased to the multimillion dollar range? My guess is he pocketed half of it and the other half went to the unwitting actors who's agents suckered them into this sham of a film. If you read the 'quotes n trivia' on Amazon's link you will find that (a) Kirsten Dunst bailed out on this sinking ship (good thinking girl) and (b) Sigourney Weaver had nightmares after she read the script...obviously she had already committed..<br /><br />SPOILER....<br /><br />Short summary of the INCREDIBLY unfeasible plot:  A bunch of people from the city who have had deaths in the family do the logical thing and go live in a wildlife preserve (although we see no animals in it), undetected by authorites , long enough to raise children, whom they traumatize into never leaving the village by dressing in monster suits and other scary tricks.  Anyone ever seen a Scooby-Doo episode?  Then 1 guy stabs another and they send a BLIND girl (with 2 guys we never saw before who wimp out immediately) to go get medicine through the forbidden forest (how she is supposed to acquire multiple-stab wound effective medicine is up to her)..but the 1st guy she meets gets it for her no problem and helps her back over the wall into the park! And the cult lives on...seriously..thats the plot.<br /><br />I've read that he stole this plot from the book 'running out of time'...not to mention the scooby-doo thing, or his camera style which he takes from hitchcock...this guy is a hack folks.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I am not big on the Harry Potter movies. Infact, you couldn't get me to watch any of them.  Now that I have an HDDVD player, my wife and I decided to try out the Order of the Phoenix movie and all I can say is ...WOW!!!  From what I have heard, this movie does not have as many action scenes as some of the previous Harry Potter films but the picture quality is just amazing.  The picture quality is so crisp and color so vivid, that this movie instantly becomes a must have.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Very satisfied with the speed of delivery and quality of the product.<br />Thanks again.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	I have already written a review on my thoughts on this film but just wanted to add that this IS classic film making not a superfical action or monster film.<br /><br />Sure M.Night is a ego manaic who really enjoys making what he believes to be masterpiece's and is probabely a tyrant to work with but the man does deliever old style story - telling, film -making and adds a few modern twists.<br /><br />In other words, the man does deliever different and classic films in the tradition of the old film makers like Alferd Hitchcock.<br /><br />I studied the movies and life of Hitchcock when i was in university and M.Night himself realtes Mr Hitch as one of his favourtite directors. There is a clear connection to the two<br /><br />However, M.Night has he own style and man, can he add emotions to even the simplest scenes. His movies tend to make me cry like a baby and i'm not a cryer.<br /><br />And for &8&8 sake can people stop relating everything to The Sixth Sense. I mean it prob one of his best films and certainly touched a larger auidence but the guy does have more to offer than this and its a tad unfair to always compare every movie he makes to that one really but him on the map. When we live in a world of fast, cellioud, popcorn movies, it is both re-freshing and important to embrace films that have directors who can make different, thought provoking films that actually make you think and question - not just eye candy for the eyes.<br /><br />Granted his films ARE slow moving, they CAN tend to make people question some of his logic, they CAN even bore people to tears but man, can he write a story that you both think and talk about for days after. He is a story teller first and film maker second and has demonstrated 4 times now that he can deliver on both.<br /><br />Six Sense was a introduction really to M.Night (yes i know he made two films prior but im talking about the commerical films only). UnBreakable was never going to live up to the 6th Sense but still delivers a interesting, fasinating story that held me to the end with a conclusion that was so obvious but yet not expected by me. Signs was a major commerical hit and once again deliver a fine story that was excuted in a way that just oozed emotion and interest for any viewer who likes a good story and film-making. Lastly The Village provides another great tale with brooding emotion. M.Night likes to make a set/or the environments isolated i have found and we tend to focus in all his movies on a very claustphobic environment that just sucks the intellegent viewer in.<br /><br />I have come to realise that people always concertrate on the suspense, horror and twists of a M.Night film and maybe thats why some find them slow and boring. But what the man SHOULD be awarded for is his ability to create a great emotional drama. I truely believe this man can film a person standing in a field and induce so much emtion somehow from the scene that it makes yah eyes tear up. M.Night is a serious film maker who develops emotional stories first and adds the supernatural elements second.<br /><br />As far as i am concerned he is a modern day filmaker using old style filmamking in the tradition of Hitchcock and his films stand out from the wham, bam movies of today. The films are about story and emotion not effects or explosions.<br /><br />Pesonally, in real life, the man would prob drive me nuts with his ego and need to write , direct,act and gloat over his films but i respect him for his clear talent in film making and ability to make a film that stands out in a Western Culture and his sheer passion towards making his films.<br /><br />In regards to The Village, i say this.....a brillant film that moves slowly but constintely and will hold for those who appriectate a good tale with dramatic flair.<br /><br />And as i said in my movie review....THIS ISNT A MONSTER FILM, TIS A DRAMATIC PIECE WITH A SUPERNATURAL FEEL.....so if u want a monster film that will scare the pants off you this aint it. But if u want creepy, spooky and at times damn sad then this is for you.<br /><br />Keep it up M.Night !!!!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I bought this movie for my son and the whole family loved it. It is a great movie
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Not the perfectly made movie but with the budget they had, they did a great job. I appreciate the message that the movie is pushing which is to fight for your marriage (for the believer) and come to Christ (for the unbeliever).
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	I have always known that the food industry is more concerned about profits than my health, but I did not imagine it was this bad!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This is great TV action and drama I recommend this show to to any one who likes new young actors. I give it a star 5.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Got the Insanity DVD's and from the moment I put them in I felt like a million bucks--don't get me wrong...it kicked my butt-but it tightened it as well.<br />Shaun-T is very motivating and is a great instructor for these videos.<br />Love the fact that the warm-ups and stretches are the same each CD-and then the workout based on the day is different.  It never gets old. Love, love, love it-<br />I don't follow the diet plan and don't follow the workout as on the calendar and I still can tell a difference. My thighs have definitely toned and tightened, but mostly my cardio has seen a great increase.<br />Did the P90X prior to this, was great as well, however my husband needs the weights the same time I do, so it didn't work out well.  Both products are true to their word--get off the couch and get moving.....
B0006989TE	1.0	b	This had to be one of the worst movies of all times... from the lackluster script to the stupid ending... as if you could not figure it out a half hour into it!!!!! And people are still buying it!!!! do yourself a favor.. save your hard earned $$$$$<br /><br />and Mr S.... oh why bother... I wasted enuff time on this...
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"You really have to appreciate this movie for more than the ""scary"" stuff it was marketed for.  I watched this movie with three other friends, and we spent (no lie) two hours afterwards just talking about the deeper issues involved in the movie.<br /><br />It is hard to say anything about it without giving anything away, so I will just say that yes, there are definitely parts that put your nerves on end, but this movie is thick.  When the end of the movie is revealed, you need to think about it's implications.<br /><br />Another excellent thing about the movie is its smashing soundtrack!  It is beautiful, and really adds flavor to the movie."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This is by far my favorite workout routine/system.  I have never encountered anything like it before.  The basic moves look very simple and the type of thing you could do without much exertion, but that is a misconception.  For those who claim the system does not work, I would question their diet and how intense they worked out.  The workout is intense, but ultimately you control the how hard you push through the intensity.<br /><br />Admittedly, there are two downsides to this workout.  First, there is a bunch of jumping so doing it in an apartment is tough.  Second, due to the intensity and moves, you may have some joint discomfort.  Personally, I have been able to work around both of these issues.  Regarding the apartment issue I have gone as far as to workout outside, or to move around some of the equipment at my apartment gym to make room (you don't need much but if you apartment is anything like mine, they cram a lot into a small space).  I have had some joint discomfort and have found it eased by two things:  first, the better my diet the less likely I am to have any discomfort; and second, when I hurt I am always able to identify a move that I am doing incorrectly.<br /><br />I know many people that have done P90X, including myself, and those who I have convinced to give Insanity a shot all agree that it is much more intense.  It is just intense in a different way.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	My husband loved the movie and couldn't wait to own the video of this film.<br />The price was good and the ordering a no brainer.  Thanks Amazon.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	"I give this 3 stars for the nice scenery and the accent that Sigur has... Southern then gradually Mexican.  But in the end, this movie left me saying.. ""this won Oscars??""  but i guess my movie preferences never really leaned towards the Oscar nominations...  Wish John Turturro was in this movie.  Josh Brolin is the man!  Goonies!! All in all... this movie wasn't as good as I was expecting from the Coen Bros."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	If Pixar can pull off an excellent movie about talking cars, they can do anything.<br /><br />When I first heard about Cars, I was a bit underwhelmed.  Talking cars?  Well, Pixar had hit gold with talking fish but...cars?  I personally had doubts about this movie, but when I came out of watching it, I was very satisfied and pleasantly suprised.<br /><br />Much like Pixar's previous films, Cars is a story diven film.  And with only three real action scenes in the entire film (two at the beginning, one at the end), it depends on it's story to stay afloat and keep the audience interested.  And i'm happy to say that the film kept my interest the entire way through.<br /><br />Cars follows a hot and fast upcoming racer named Lightning McQueen, a racecar who will stop at nothing to get to the top and become the champion.  However, on his way to a tie-breaker race, he becomes lost in a little route 66 town that's fallen off the map.  Here, high and mighty ego clashes with small town slowness and McQueen undergos a personal journey to find himself and what really matters in his life.<br /><br />When trying to think of negatives for this movie...I can't think of any. There really is nothing wrong with Cars. There are no weak points that immediatly come to mind. It pulls your emotions in the right directions at the right time and for the right amount of time.  I laughed, chuckled and applauded at all the right moments (especially the farting tractors).  So did everyone else in the theater.  Even side charachters, some of whom have only a few lines, are strong and well played.  I'd say that there are no weak charachters in Cars, something that is all too rare these days.  Even those who don't really contribute to the plot (the surplus military jeep for example) are fun to watch.  This is a great film that anyone can watch and enjoy, though action fans might find themselves a bit bored during most of the movie.  It has a great message (sometimes you have to get lost to find yourself), morals about what's really important in life, and what's worth winning, and so much more.  Heck, even a malfunctioning stoplight is enjoyable to watch.  Everyone in the theater that I attended had a blast and enjoyed watching the movie.<br /><br />Cars is easily one of the best films of the year, the kind that you can't stop raving about, and is almost certianly going to be the main contender for best animated feature. This is annother winner for Pixar, and is a great film that everyone should watch at least once.<br /><br />Oh, and be sure to stay for the credits. Trust me on this one.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	Many people deserve second chances, I guess movies are the same. I saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and fell asleep whilst watching it. Reading the book I really didn't build my hopes up, having already done that with 'Watchmen' which was disappointing. However this is a new year, and just recently seeing all six parts of the movies, I feel compelled to review this movie. It is a journey movie, and the locales of the movie are extraordinary. The actors are getting better in their performance, and throwing in Bill Nighy made the movie just a bit better. Voldemort in my opinion is not terrific cinematic villain (He's no Darth Vader or Heath Ledger's Joker)he's at best a villain worthy of showtunery. Nevertheless I found this movie to be quite a treat. Note to others I was sleeping off and on. I am eagerly anticipating Deathly Hallows pt. 2.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Great series of movies, I am looking forward to the next one and I wish there would be more after that.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I'll keep this short and simple: True Blood Season 1, like all the other seasons on Blu-Ray, is quite amazing. The audio quality is very rich, as it is very warm, and video quality is what you'd expect from a Blu-Ray disc. I use my PlayStation 3 for Blu-Ray viewing.<br /><br />As for the show itself, True Blood is highly addictive and unlike any on the market right now. Keep the Vampire Diaries and Twilight junk for the kids. And for anyone that reviews the show with one-star because it's nothing like the Sookie Stackhouse books, well, get over it. The Harry Potter movies weren't exactly like the books and look what they did for the box-office? The same could even be said about the Lord of the Rings. Just enjoy the show! Who enjoys a copy of a copy, of a copy, anyway? People could use a little change.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I missed Jeff Dunham's Comedy Central Special except for the last 5 minutes. I was upset that I missed it, but ecstatic when they advertised for this DVD. I ordered it and was extremely happy I did so. The whole family loved it! Not only did we all laugh our butts off, but the price was very reasonable too. I will definetly order from Amazon again in the future. If you want a good hearty laugh and you want to see a brilliant ventriliquist, get this DVD!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"This tape replaces the one someone ""borrowed"".  We love Jeff and all his friends so I wanted to have all of them again.  It is hilarious every time we watch it."
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	please amazon make sure that the coding for the movie is a video code 1. the movie was released previosly as a video code 4. this doesn't play in the united states and canada. the movie writeup specifies the code as unknown. please verify before releasing it.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	This video was funny, but I have to say I liked his first one (Arguing With Myself) better.  Was worth the money though.  Got a lot of laughs out of it.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I bought this for my Grand Children.They watch it all the time and love it.Their ages are 5 & 6 years
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Food Inc enlightened me mostly about the lives/death of chickens and the industry greed to make a profit.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"Really fabulous movie. Its a shame we have to come back for Part 2 (and buy it, lol) but so far, judging from this movie its well worth it. Plus, for once the book readers and the only-movie watchers are semi-satisfied. That's sort of a guarantee. Things are missing, things are modified to make them ""cooler"" but it works.<br /><br />Hollywood has to change things like they intend to with the next movie and Snape's scene, but that so that the same feelings we felt from reading the book can be felt in a movie. You can't translate things exactly the same from book to screen and make people understand and believe and feel it.<br /><br />This movie is well worth the leap of faith.<br /><br />The kids are out of Hogwarts now, and while that could have backfired on them, it worked really well. Everything really worked really well. They are much more experienced actors and it shows. The trio in particular are completely fabulous in this one.<br /><br />I'll be buying this version, on blue-ray, merely because it was THAT good. I've been a fan of Harry Potter for roughly eleven years now, and I was not at all disappointed. Ended up watching this movie twice in theaters, which I have never done.<br /><br />The effects are not cheesy, even the ""shield"" or ""protection"" magics, and its pretty clear to anyone; it doesn't skip too many things that the ""only-movie watchers"" need to know. Did I have to explain a few things to the guy next to me that kept taking me away from the movie? Sure. But I have to admit, I had to explain a great deal less than what I thought they'd cut out.<br /><br />Worth buying and watching again and again. Best Harry Potter movie yet."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I was fortunate to see this show live in Newport Kentucky back in July and have been anxiously awaiting the release of the DVD.  Jeff and company are totally hilarious and I did not stop laughing the entire show.  I love a comedian that can bring on laughing tears.  Of course Walter is my favorite, but his new additions bring a new spark to the show.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	If you are a Harry Potter fan or have fans in your family, this DVD is a must.  It gets watched over and over.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Was a fantastic part 1 of the last movie of the Harry Potter films. Wish they would of won something for all the hard work they had done making the movies.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"Maybe you have to be a baby boomer to appreciate the detail and sly references made in Cars. I saw things like a Pontiac hood ornament shaped rock formation and Cadilac tailfins in the mountain range. There are so many cool ""little"" things in this movie that after seeing it in the theater, I had to buy the DVD. All of the Route 66 and NASCAR elements made this a movie I can watch many times, as I always notice something that I missed during previous viewings. I think that the younger viewers may not ""get it"". Paul Newman as a Hudson Hornet is classic and real people voiceing their cartoon characters is an added bonus."
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	"This film's over the top violence reminded me of ""Natural Born Killers"", but this film was infinitely better directed and had a much better story line.  I can certainly see how many people can love this film and find it terribly exciting.  I can likewise see how others will rate the film 1 star, based on the fact that the three interesting stories may soon be forgotten but that the graphic, horrible images may stick around for much longer.<br /><br />I don't think it can be overstated that this film is not for children.  In fact, anyone who would let someone under 12 watch this should literally be charged with child abuse.  The director appears to revel in graphic human torture; even the ""heroes"" in the story prefer torture to accomplishing a mission (or maybe torturing an adversary IS the mission).  This is the kind of film, even more than the name implies, is about the dark side of mankind.  Some will say that some characters are heroic, but even Bruce Willis brings much pain to the world by not finishing off a killer, prefering instead to torture him.  The writer really went after police and the clergy, ranking them well below prostitutes who tend to have a heart of gold.<br /><br />All that aside, the story lines are good and the film is extremely creative and well made.  Given the level of violence, I would normally turn a film like this off, but this film's creativity, storylines, and film quality keep me watching.  It was an enjoyable film, but I didn't think it was great.<br /><br />One of the attractions of the film was the all star cast.  Here's how the actors fared:<br /><br />Bruce Willis - Great job.  He IS his character. Wow. A+<br /><br />Benicio Del Toro - Also excellent.  A+ performance as expected from someone of his caliber.<br /><br />Micky Rourke - The most overated actor in Hollywood finally hits a Home Run. - A+.<br /><br />Clive Owen - Shows much more here than in ""Closer"" - A<br /><br />Jessica Alba - Although very attrative, doesn't bring more than looks to the film. B-<br /><br />Elijah Wood - I keep looking for Gandalf when he was on screen - C, but not really his fault.<br /><br />Brittany Murphy - Better than expected performance - B+<br /><br />Rosario Dawson - Miscast in her role - C<br /><br />Nick Stahl - He fits his character - A<br /><br />The others, such as Rutger Hauer, Michael Madsen, and Josh Hartnett do well in their brief performances.  Devon Aoki gets noticed.<br /><br />Overall, this film is not for everyone, but if you're not too offended by wallowing in violence and discussions of raping and torturing children, you'll probably find you enjoy the film and possibly even love it.  Although there is a lot of violence, there is also a lot to like about the film."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	You need to watch this and then buy it for every member of your family. It needs to be spread, pass it along!!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	OMG THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAIZING I DONT HAVE ANY OTHER WORDS THIS IS BY FAR THE GREATEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME (FITNESS WISE) ITS RIDDICULOUS BEEN SEARCHING FOR THIS BODY RESULTS MY WHOLE LIFE!! THANK GOD FOR INSANITY.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	A great mini-series, I highly recommend it!  This is NOT a family show.  Scenes of tarring and feathering and an amputation at sea make it most definitely a show that is inappropriate for kids, but it will bring back everything you learned in history class and more.  Highly recommend you read McCullough's book (that it is based upon) too.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I am ahead of the curve this year.  Due to the repeated usage and viewing from the little one, this is yet another replacement for an awesome movie.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	The movie itself was good but it was difficult to see everything going on because it was always extremely dark.  My son watched it on his computer and it was much better,  but we were disappointed in this.  We also would have purchased the next one when it comes out - the second part of this story - but now we are wary that it is going to turn out the same way.<br /><br />Incidentally, we now live in Springfield, TN, not California.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I thought that this was an exceptionally good movie for kids and grown ups alike.  The characters that the actors play are very funny. I would definately buy this movie again for a gift for Christmas or a birthday. Check it out and it will make you laugh again and again, but it also has a really good moral to the story. When you start out small and make your way to the top ALWAYS remember the little people that helped you to get there.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Purchased Import HD DVD and it is just amazing. PQ is a 10, audio a 9, HD bonus content a 10 also.  If you have a HD DVD player why buy anything else? Also the whole HDi, that only HD DVD can give you, is going to blow Blu-Ray out of the water! I think we have found the next-gen winning format! Check out www.hddvd.com for more information on HDi.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Food Inc. was a very insightful look into cultivating, raising, and processing of food in the United States. This movie provides the information we need to motivate us to stop supporting the poisoning of our bodies by buying chemically treated and processed foods. At the end of the movie, I was convinced that my time had come -- I moved to the organic side of the fence (after just a couple of weeks I am already clearer and my weight is heading down).
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I don't own the set, but I would love to have it. i have watched all of the first season a few times. It's that good and addictive. Those who picked the cast did a wonderful job. If you love the show, the books are a must read.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"Comedy Central only shows parts of this ""Insane"" Video.  Every member of our family enjoyed it and found our selves chuckling over things two or three days later just thinking about them.  What a wonderful way to unwind after a bad day at work."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Excellent movie! So well done, from the interviews to the video coverage. I think every doctor, health care worker, nutritionist, teacher, sports coach, personal fitness trainer, and parent should see this film. It would also be great for college students and maybe even high school seniors. In other words, I think nearly everyone should see this film. If more people knew where their food came from and how it was prepared, they would make different food choices, possibly improving their health.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"I must start off by saying that I am a dark fiction writer, so I am, perhaps, slightly more critical of ""horror"" than others are. That said, I am sorry to admit that my hero, the usually delightful Mr. Shyamalan, has produced a movie that somehow lacks plot elements that were necessary to make this movie a good movie.<br /><br />For a length of the movie, it had great potential, although it was slow. I decided to give it a bit; that he might have been trying for good ol' gothic ""boo!""s. But the time dragged on, and suddenly, when my moviegoing companion and I were expecting the normal M. Night Shyamalan plot twist that makes everyone go ""what? wow"", there was the plot twist-one of the worst plot deviced I have ever seen! It introduces elements that do not make sense and go unexplained. Viewers are left with more questions than answers and, for the first time, I left one of this man's movies quite unsatisfyied. It is such a shame that acting talent like who was in this movie was wasted. Frankly, I am shocked. I wondered if it would make any more sense if I was able to ask him personally to explain the movie to me before I remembered one of the key indications of a bad plot: if you, as the writer, must explain to each and every one of your fans what your project is about, it is time to go back to the drawing board."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I have not laughed so hard in a very long time, my face hurt, my eyes were watering and I had to watch it several times because I would miss something when I was laughing so hard. Have spread the joy around by having neighbors over and then I can watch them fall on the floor laughing.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	DVD arrived timely and in great shape. Nicely packaged. Subject matter difficult, as I had been warned. Glad to have bought the DVD used, as I'll pass it on rather than keep it for future viewing.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	For the real HP fans, that was the whole purpose of getting the ultimate editions; to see the the movies in their ultimate and complete form.  It simply indicates a lack of understand on the part of WB regarding their real audience.  Collector cards and fancy boxes might be great for the kids, but most of us bought the ultimate edition for the full movie.  One more thought from a fan.  Up until HP and the Deathly Hallows P1, the earlier movies have remained pretty true (if not complete) to their books.  Not so with HP and the Deathly Hallows P1. (Harry not disguised at the wedding; Harry and Herminoe not not under the clock when they entered Godrick's Hallow, the real reason the Lovegood's home was destroyed, etc.)  Although a good movie, I hope they do a better job with part 2.
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	"The single star is not a review of the movie, but to agree with other reviews that object to Combo releases. I question there is a real market for Combo releases and see this as a means to charge higher prices for the most popular movies. I refuse to buy any Combo releases for the higher $$$ and urge other buyers to do as well. We need to send a message or we will see everything released in Combo adding up to 40% to the price!!! The arguments made for Combos are that (1) you can also play it on standard DVD players and (2) it ""future"" protects us in case the HD DVD format becomes obsolete. For (1), there may be some interest in this but for me I didn't buy an HD DVD player to watch movies on a standard DVD player. For (2) frankly, I'll take my chances because if HD DVD becomes obsolete, existing players will last for quite a while and combo players will be available. Also, I can afford to buy into Blu-Ray or any other new technology with the money I saved not buying Combos (I wouldn't take a step backward to DVD). If the studios think there is a market for Combos, fine! -> Just release a HD DVD only version also at the same time. See how many they sell of each. Frankly, I only moved up to HD DVD when I saw Amazon pricing them comparable to DVD. If you don't think there is a strategy on the part of the studios using Combos to generate more revenue just look at the upcoming releases of White Noise (HD DVD only) and White Noise 2 (Combo). What sense does that make other than to create interest with the first movie and then sock it to you on the second! Look at this and other series (Harry Potter, Bourne, Oceans 11-13, etc.) same pattern. If they truly want the launch of HD DVD to be successful (as I do!), Combos pricing is very counterproductive. Annoyed and frustrated."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Overall I believe this dvd set was very well done. It gives the viewer the chance to see the second President in a very well laid out manner. It shows him in the beginnings of his career right up to the end. I also especially like the extra the Facts are stubborn things, which showed historical facts during each video. For the price, this set is well worth it. Paul Giamatti also plays the part of John Adams very well.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"One thing that the had missing from the Indiana Jones trilogy was science fiction. Well now we have an X-Files version of Indiana... for what it is worth.<br /><br />  Let's be fair - it is a little better than Temple of Doom - however, it is a far cry from ""Raiders"" or ""Crusade"". The first half of the movie was reminiscent of the Raiders of the Lost Ark and had my expectations high... however at that point it takes a right turn and turns into a 1950's B movie that focuses on aliens. Most surprising is that this was exactly what Lucas and Spielberg were aiming for. According to the interviews that is included in the extras Spielberg states they wanted to redo Indiana and stylize it into the 1950's era. Not a bad idea, but it did not work for me.<br /><br />My biggest complaint - Shia Labeouf was terribly miscast and (in my opinion) nearly ruined the movie.  Let's hope that if another Indiana Jones is made that he is left on the sideline.<br /><br />Final Verdict -<br /><br />  Not bad - however, most Indiana Jones fans will range from mildly satisfied to devastated. For me - I am glad that I watched it - but when I am looking to kill a little a time by watching a Indy movie... I will grab ""Raiders"" or ""Crusade"" and leave<br />The Crystal Skull"" on the shelf.<br /><br />3 Stars"
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	That's the only way to describe this film.  It has a talented all-star cast, but a horribly mapped out plot.  By movies end, I was left wondering why so much useless information was thrown it, while important tid bits where left out...what was in that letter?<br /><br />Not to mention, the amount of blatant murder that went on was too far fetched for my taste.  I mean, I am sure there are and always have been many crooked people serving in law enforcement, but there has to be many more who aren't, to sift through and figure out what really happened...<br /><br />After spending 2+ hours watching this, you are left feeling a bit short changed!! Which means I would have to agree with other reviewers who say this isn't one I will be watching again and again.<br /><br />Not one I would recommend...
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	I've read the book, and while this film was short, it got to the nitty-gritty of the continuing series. There were some things that might have gotten more mention, such as the Centaurs and their argument,but it was straight forward in showing the way the Ministry was slowly interfering in the day to day affairs of the school under Voldemort's spreading influence and the unfair nature sometimes revealed by those in league with it. The scene where Harry becomes an impromtu Defense against the Dark Arts teacher was both funny and a joy and seeing Neville coming out of his shell shows that there is more we need to see of him. The battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore is not to be missed, proving the old professor has style. I hope this isn't the last of the Potter films. I've read how it ended, but now I want to see it.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"Stunning.  Simply stunning.  SIN CITY is, by far, one of the coolest action thrillers I have ever seen.  Watching it was like being thrown into the dark graphic novels that comprise Frank Miller's world: gritty, dark, bleak, and hostile.  It must have been a monumental task to film, judging from the featurettes included with the DVD.  The actors had to film almost entirely in front of a green screen, allowing the visual effects team to create the most intricate of backgrounds for each shot.  For my eyes, it is the ultimate noir piece.  Due to the computer backgrounds, there is perfect control over the lighting, black & white textures, etc.  Everything is controlled in this film (visually) right down to the smallest detail.  In turn, I think it is safe to say that Director Robert Rodriguez has done the best job of any director at bringing a comic book to the big screen.  This is not a corny adaptation with little men running around in costumes.  Rather than force the comic book world into the theater, the audience is dropped into that world.  The effect is stunning.<br /><br />Yet, despite the fact that the film is visually stunning, it does not rely solely on its effects to make the film.  The acting is quite good.  The entire group is perfectly cast: they seem ripped right out of the graphic novels.  In particular, Bruce Willis seems particularly suited to his role.  He belongs in this world.  But more so than any other actor, Mickey Rourke takes the cake.  He is a great character to open the movie with given that his performance and makeup job instantly set the tone for the entire film.  I hope to see more films working in this style and you'd better believe that Rourke should be at the top of the casting list next time.<br /><br />Even if you've never heard of Frank Miller or are not a fan of traditional action movies, SIN CITY will knock your socks off.  It is very unique and hopefully we haven't seen the last of its kind.  Of course, take my recommendation with a grain of salt: if you are opposed to graphic violence, you might be offended by the film.  Sin City is not the land of ""It's a Small World After All."""
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"In Pixar's CARS, directed by TOY STORY director John Lasseter, the world is populated entirely by - you guessed it - cars.  So it's only natural that the biggest event in the entire car world is the Piston Cup, the world's most popular race (inspired by the ever-popular NASCAR racing).  This year, the public's rooting for Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), an immensely-talented albeit egotistic rookie.  While traveling to California to prepare for the Piston Cup, Lightning's driver, Mack (John Ratzenberger), dozes off and sends Lightning off into the middle of nowhere.  The middle of nowhere happens to be the small town of Radiator Springs, or - as Lightning described it - ""hillbilly hell"".  Though at first Lightning wants nothing more than to escape from Radiator Springs and win the Piston Cup, he gradually becomes more and more attached to the town and its citizens, eventually realizing that friends and family mean more than fame.<br /><br />Pixar makes family movies better than anyone.  Adults find their films just as entertaining as do children.  CARS is no exception, though it lacks the power of many of Pixar's previous creations, such as TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  Also, it is becoming more and more clear that Pixar's films seem to revolve around the same sort of formula.  Eventually, I believe that this will begin to bother some adults, but the children will go on loving these films, and that's what the films are here for in the first place.<br /><br />The cast for CARS is even more impressive than that of previous Pixar films.  The cast includes, along with Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, NASCAR racers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr., FINDING NEMO/A BUG'S LIFE director Andrew Stanton, Jay Leno, and Michael Keaton.  That is quite the cast.  It also features music by Randy Newman and some fantastic animation.<br /><br />Despite all that it has going for it, CARS was considered a flop at the box office, primarily when compared to Pixar's previous masterpieces.  I believe that this is due in part to the advertising, which I thought made the film look like many of the other stupid CGI family film imitations in theaters recently.  All I can say is disregard the advertising and see the film for yourself.  It's another delightful family film from Pixar.  Your kids'll love it, and you'll love it too.  What more could you ask for?"
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	Enjoyed this rendition of a classic. Was a little hard to follow in parts but other wise good. Will watch again.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	this is by far one of the best harry potter movies to date, and I can't wait to see how it all ends
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	First of all I did enjoy the first three Indiana Jones flicks. Raiders had great action scenes and special effects that are still hard to top today. Temple of Doom heavied up on the action and some scenes scared the crap out of me when I was a kid, especially the guy getting lowered into the lava. Last Crusade was probably the best of the bunch PERIOD. Now we have Crystal Skull. First of all, I'm glad that Harrison Ford came back and so did Steven Spielberg as director. Oh, can't forget Karen Allen as Indy's love, Marion. Shia LaBeouf just did not carry the film at all with his performance. I went to see the movie just to see Indy in more action and the science fiction story with the aliens did play a descent part in the movie. My stepfather plans to buy the film on Blu-Ray, but I want the DVD release. Is the movie worth watching? Yes, if you are a fan of the three previous films, which I loved. I did enjoy this movie, but it was nowhere close as good as the original three. I still give the movie 5 stars because I left the movie theater impressed as I'm sure anyone else did when they saw this film and the original three. I say it's worth it and if they do another Indiana Jones film, bring back Harrison Ford if they can. As for the movie, SEE IT!
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	"Just wasted $3.99 on this video. Highschool-esque actors, recycled Lord-of-the-Rings props, road movie storyline. Let's not forget the ever-so-popular ""public adress"" towards the end, that Hollywood so loves that they build it into seemingly 90% of their flicks these days. Booooring! Enough time spend on this cringeworthy Twilight spin-off."
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	"Robert Rodriguez make good children movies.  Sin City is not very different from Spy Kids in intelectual delights or graphic innovation.  The violence (that is only strong for American viewers  that don't watch world cinema or, let's say, news) is relentless and a little pointless (I mean, there is no use to it, no interesting commentary about it, it simply exists).  The CGI backgrounds are well used this time (vs. the well-received and far-from-good ""Sky Captain..."") but some of the shots (for example, when travelling in cars) are so stilized that take from the possible force of situations all the tension: in a fantasy world, the world of videogames and C-movies Rodriguez and Tarantino grew in, you never die even when you do and so there's no danger.  The non-linear screenplay ala ""Pulp Fiction"" also takes out of the film its share of interest, and so we are left with the esthetics and the gorgeous girls (and maybe that was the intention of the auteur).  I don't know if the film is going to survive the relentless advancement of technological eye candy (that makes fx made for fx wonderment some years ago look like, ahem, garbage) but the undoubtful interest of Rodriguez in his material and the efforts put in the realization makes this film at least a candidate to top the comic adaptation sub-genre for many years to come."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Awesome DVD; Service was great, no damage to the DVD and arrived in a timely manner.  Thanks
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	Jeff Dunham is an excellent entertainer! The DVD was brand new and arrived very quickly!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Do you like Vampires who don't sparkle in the sunlight, or sulk around high school like little emo jerks? Do you like love stories that actually have depth? What about characters who are multi-faceted? Do you like nudity, violence, and comedy? Are you not a 13 year old girl? If you answered yes to all of these questions, then True Blood is the Vampire story for you. This show is both a creatively interesting fantasy, and a realistic drama full of analogies for social and political problems. The setting and period make the issues faced in the show easily relate to issues like racism, and gay marriage... or really, prejudice of any kind. If you like fantasy, are socially aware, and don't mind using your brain from time to time, I really recommend watching this show. Also, the dvd has some interesting features, such as commercials (from the states, and over-seas. Personally, I think the french commercial was better), and PSA's about Vampires, which help make the world of True Blood a little more real.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	I can't believe that this film is rated so highly.  There were three types of males in this movie:  Bad guy, bad cop, and good cop with a bad attitude.  There were four types of females in this movie:  Hooker, dike, stripper, and whore.<br /><br />What kind of a freak could like a movie like this?  Once again, Tarrantino is overrated because of his shock techniques, and not because of any viable talent.  When I realized that there was no plot to this film, I looked for art.  No art was visible.  Basically, this film is a freakshow that freaks will enjoy...GAG!!!!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This product came in a very short time, and the price was less than I could have purchased the dvd here in the stores.  Including the shipping.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	This movie is lean, solid entertainment. It wastes no time, is well paced and smartly written with snappy dialogue and good subtext. The action delivers the goods, but not at the expense of story or character.<br /><br />  Most importantly, this movie is FUN! Robert Downey Jr. is a one man party onscreen - funny, smart and compelling to watch throughout. It seems as though he's having more fun than should be legal ( I know, don't tempt him).<br /><br />  The effects are breathtaking, seamlessly switching from practical to cg without calling attention to artifice - a major feat these days. All the gadgetry seemed plausible somehow and delivered ( for me at least ) a sense of giddy wish fulfillment - I totally bought that this guy could fly around in a high tech suit of armor.<br /><br />  Gwyneth Paltrow is a pleasant surprise. I have to admit that I was ambivalent about her, but here she's great, and mines a layer of vulnerability in her character that could have easily been unrealized by lesser talent. Oh, and did I mention that she looks really HOT?!?! She looks really HOT!<br /><br />  Terrence Howard is good as the straight man and there were a couple male-bonding scenes with Downey Jr. that rang as being particularly genuine.<br /><br />  Jeff Bridges ( always a pleasure ) does a great job of taking his character from ambiguous manipulator to outright villain without any breaks in logic or motivation.<br /><br />  The movie balances humor, drama and action with a light tone while still managing a fairly serious subtext about war profiteering and global violence.<br /><br />  It all adds up to one of the most entertaining popcorn flicks around and a serious contender for 'best superhero movie' award. A better time at the movies is hard to find.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Its really hard to review a standup comedy routine  ""critiquingly"". If it's GREAT, like this one is, I would have to resort to the overwhelming non-lack of cliches plastered on the covers of movie boxes and posters across the Land.<br /><br />What it boils down to, is this (and its very simple): This is one of the funniest and most tallented stand-up acts I have ever seen. You have your all-time greats like Pryor and (fill in your fav here) but did they hold three-way conversations at lightning speed and legibly conveying three unique voices with three different personalities? Either he has incredible tallent or he's related to Emily Rose.<br /><br />In short, its fantastic - Excellent - pullamuscle funny - and man does it deliver. Highly recommended for you adults who need a change in pace.  ~saos~"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Excellent Movie and great action.  Robert Downey, Jr. is one of the best actor's in Hollywood.  He makes this look effortless.  Wow
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Let me start by saying that this was our first time to see this movie. We are agressively searching for 3D Bluray movies for our new 3D sets. We were thoroughly impressed with the effects and sound of this movie. We highly recommend this 3D Bluray.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Well-acted drama. Enjoyed historical settings and interiors. Interesting cast of characters and superb development. At times outrageous, but nevertheless appealing, even spell-binding.<br /><br />Inasmuch as I enjoy period/era dramas, I would certainly recommend this one very highly and would buy others of similar quality and interest.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Pure and utter propoganda.  Not once during the entire content of this movie is there any mention of evidence to support the 'Intelligent Design' hypothesis.  The whole film is dedicated to exposing perceived prejudice against those that wish to espouse ID as an alternative to the Theory of Evolution and yet no-one seems able to explain what the strengths of ID are.  Ben Stein's attempt to link the Holocaust to Darwin is simply shameful, the disingenousness of producers whilst interviewing participants has been widely reported across the internet and everyone but the most religiously biased individuals understand that Intelligent Design is nothing more than a long line of efforts to promote Biblical creationism.<br /><br />In short, this movie does exactly the opposite of what it intended.  It merely exposes Intelligent Design advocates as the fundamentalist nutcases that they really are.  Ben Stein should hang his head in shame.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"I, personally, found this movie to be quite excellent.<br /><br />The opening scene is just terrifying with Javier Bardem.  (Although, the thick accent of Tommy Lee Jones' voice over was a bit of an obstacle at first.)<br /><br />I think the overall film was just great, and true to the novel it was based on.  Every performance was mesmerizingly good!  The eerie absense of a score made it all the more real for me as a viewer.  And the cinematography was well executed.  I could not have asked for a better adapation.<br /><br />A word of caution: I know many people cannot stand this film, but I think it deserves at least one impartial viewing.  I liked this as a modernization of ""the western"" genre.  In stead of trying to cram modern ideals into an historic setting, the Coen Brothers updated the western using great source material as their guide.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, especially for Javier Bardem's chilling performance as one of the greatest maniacs in movie history."
B0006989TE	3.0	b	First off this is an ok  movie but it would have been great  if it were in the movie category of love and drama but a love story is definitely not what i expected. Im very assured that everyone who sall the previews for the movie expected a film full of suspense and  have you at the edge of your seat like i did. It seems as if  M. night miss lead his viewers into believing that the movie would be scary and  bone chilling but it's not i get scared a little easier than others and i was ok for the entire movie.This movie also had twists to it that  was very much not needed M. night likes twits in his movie but in the village he should of stuck to the horror and suspense script these twists make take the movie from good to bad to awful.To end this i have to say this movie could have been great  but the crazy mind of M.night just doesn't  work  with this film.Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard  had the best performance's of their carrer even know bryce is a rookie it was as if this were her 10th movie these two might be the only thing that kept me in the theater.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	The only time I can remember a film deservedly won the Best Picture Oscar was when Return of the King won but that seemed more like a cumulative work than of the film itself (plus the fact it practically swept the whole night made it boring to watch). Ever since then we've had years where a film should've won or wasn't even nominated and we debate on whether the film is that good or if it was just a slow year. Crash is still a bad movie, most people forgot Chicago and Shakespeare in Love and I don't know anyone who watched the English Patient. No Country for Old Men, the latest winner, is a film where some say it was more than deserved while others thought it was well made but not the best but that's always the case huh?<br /><br />Texan Llewellyn Moss stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad, with one left alive and a bag with around 2 million in it. Against better reason, he returns to give the survivor water but people catch on and are hot on his tail. Notable is Anton Chigurh, a cunning and quite psychopathic man with a silencer-equipped shotgun, a cattle gun and a detachment to his kills and maybe even a bit of pleasure. Trying to save Moss and catch Chigurh is Sheriff Bell who's finding it more harder to be a sheriff when a lot of the old values have seemingly disappeared.<br /><br />Last year, Martin Scorsese's The Departed won the big prize which I felt was more like an award for his whole career rather than the film itself. With the Coen Brothers, they have had a wildly varied career from hits (Fargo, Big Lebowski) to failures (Ladykillers or the decent Intolerable Cruelty) so a lot of people can say No Country is most likely their finest since Fargo or Lebowski but strangely No Country didn't sit well on the second and third viewing. Not that it isn't a finely made film, remarkably restrained and not as showy, but I felt the film didn't improve when I saw it again even though most films do the more you see it.<br /><br />The 3 leads do super jobs playing their roles from 2007's big hitter Josh Brolin who had no less than 4 prominent roles, Tommy Lee Jones and the Award winning Javier Bardem. The latter of whom probably portrays the most evil and chilling villain in some time with intelligence yet a complete resolve to kill all in its way, it's certainly worth the nod as well as the win (though I'm sad Casey Affleck didn't get it for Jesse James). The rest of the cast has Woody Harrelson who is somewhat unneeded and Trainspotting's Kelly McDonald playing Moss' wife.<br /><br />Where the film might be an issue for some is in its ending which is quite unresolved and leaves quite a few questions unanswered and one scene involving a cat lover that I didn't like and it becomes one of those films that becomes well known because of what ending it was rather than how it fitted with the story, even though the book had the same thing. Not that it's a bad ending but it's one where it kind of nags in your mind for its emptiness rather than its emotional impact.<br /><br />Not being entirely familiar with their oeuvre, I'd recommend No Country but then again just because it won doesn't mean everyone will love it.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"While interviewing Gillian Anderson on Late Night many years ago, David Letterman heard a synopsis of the X-Files and said, ""Basically, you're running around chasing after space monkeys!"".<br />Too many years later, Harrison Ford is reduced to doing the same thing. As an added bonus, they managed to take all the fun out of the movie too. Good grief. Let's pray they don't try another Star Wars with Han Solo."
B001OHS8BQ	3.0	b	"I'm a Christian. There are so many wonderful elements to this movie, it's hard to say anything bad about it. However...<br /><br />The many strong and good points of this movie have been beautifully articulated and thoughtfully explained in the 40 prior reviews. I'm gladdened to see this type of God-centered, faith-based movie getting the attention and praise it so richly deserves.<br /><br />However, there were some significant inadequacies in the movie that didn't set well with me.<br /><br />The movie begins with a little girl getting tucked into bed at night with a Mom's loving kiss on the forehead. As the camera pans the room, we see a wall plaque which reads ""Daddy's Little Girl."" The child tells Moma that she wants Daddy to come tell her good-night. Moma tells her, ""Daddy's at the firestation tonight..."" Other sweet comments are exchanged and we're given the message, this little girl is dearly loved and cherished by both Mom and Daddy.<br /><br />Fast forward 25 years and it shows that the little girl is all grown up and married to a fireman, just like Daddy. Problem is, their 10-year-old marriage isn't working anymore and they both want to call it quits.<br /><br />In another scene, we see young hubby Caleb talking with his parents, both of whom are solid, good citizens, living the suburban dream in a beautiful home about four hours away from Cat and Caleb's over-gabled McMansion.<br /><br />So what's wrong with that? Well, a lot. Both Cat (pretty young wife) and Caleb (handsome young hubby) came from an Ozzie and Harriet family. Mom and Dad on both sides were still happily married and living the American dream and everything was all buttoned up and beautiful.<br /><br />Instead of Mom telling the little girl, ""Daddy's at the firestation tonight,"" what if she had to tell her, ""You know Daddy's living with his new girlfriend now in another state and he's told us he won't be coming by for any more visits. I'm so sorry, my dear little girl. It's just you and me now.""<br /><br />My point is, if you had the incredible blessing of being raised by two caring parents who managed to stay married for 30+ years and then you go out into life and manage to find someone else who also had the incredible blessing of being raised by two caring parents who managed to stay married for 30 years, you're 4,387 miles ahead of most of us. And with that as your backdrop, if there is no abuse or violence or drug addiction in the marriage, you *should* be able to work it out and keep going.<br /><br />But most of us don't come from that background. I know so many people (myself included) who came from a background where a father walked out the door one day and didn't look back. I know many other people whose parents were so mired in addictive, screwed-up behaviors that they never should have even tried to parent a child.<br /><br />Cat (the young wife) came across in this movie as a woman with the emotional depth of a mudpuddle. If it weren't for the occasional facial expressions, I would have wanted to poke her with a stick to see if she was a real person or just a life-size, cardboard cut-out. Maybe it's my age (50) or life experience (seen lots of sadness) or some other undefinable feature of life, but I wanted to grab both these young people and shake the selfishness right out of them.<br /><br />If these were real people, I'd tell them, ""Have you any clue how blessed your life was? Have you any idea how many blessings God has placed in your life? Have you any idea how amazing it is that your parents - both of them - cherished you and loved you and nurtured you?""<br /><br />As I said in the beginning, I'm thrilled to see these ""Good News"" movies hit the mainstream. I'm glad to see the message of ""work harder to stay married"" being shouted from the movie studio balconies. But it lost me when it showed the backgrounds of these young people. Our world would be a wholly  different place if we could all grow up with two parents who loved us.<br /><br />In today's world, that's just not the reality.<br /><br />And please, don't slap me with a negative vote just because you disagree with my opinion. The negative vote means the review was poorly written, off-topic or unhelpful."
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	This easily ranks as the worst, least intelligent movie I have seen in years. If I could give it zero stars I would.<br /><br />Its claim to be a serious treatment of the evolution issue is absurd. Ben Stein is obnoxious, boring, and melodramatic. His weepy act at the concentration camp was just offensive. As if it does some sort of justice to the victims of genocide to lay the blame at the feet of a scientific theory with unfounded assumptions and baseless associations. Please do not further this ridiculous cause by buying the DVD. It is not an elegant presentation of one side of a vigorous debate. It is a silly, unspohisticated romp through nonsense that debases the debate itself. Stein's interview with Richard Dawkins was probably the pinnacle of ridiculousness in this waste of time. In his efforts to try and make Dawkins look silly, Stein comes off looking, quite frankly, like an idiot. While I don't particluarly care about Dawkins one way or the other, I don't think the debate desreves the ignorant mudslinging hack treatment that Stein gives it.<br /><br />The film does accomplish one thing. It ultimately becomes a propoganda film for its cause, much like the Nazi propoganda it associated with evolution. This film could be dangerous if its simplistic arguments and baseless hollow accusations are persuasive. I don't believe it will. I am certain it will be heralded only by those who already believed in its perspective, and anathema to those of us looking for a real exchange of ideas.<br /><br />[...]
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"I didn't listen to anyone, except I heard it had crappy reviews. Sorry, but I was totally taken in by M. Night's most recent addition to his respectable filmography. Let's just say that I can say no more than has already be said by ""Spotlight Reviewers"" Lawrence M. Barnabo and Brittany Hinson. Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, is definitely a force to be reckoned with; she is so natural and lovely, there is no question that her career in on the move. Also, William Hurt showed more passion than I've seen from him since ""Children of a Lesser God"". Hey! He can still act. This was a good performance. Adrian Brody was fine; he probably finished this just before he won his Oscar. And...I've loved Sigourney Weaver in almost everything she's done, and she didn't let me down. Mr. Shyamalan still has it. Don't write him off too soon."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	First of all, I know that this isn't a review either. But after reading quite a bit of the reviews (um, comments) from both camps, I'd like to add my two cents.<br /><br />I watched Ben Stein's film last night, and from the onset it is overtly obvious that, as an ID proponent, he does have an agenda. But after all is said and done, if those in the Creationist camp are indeed a bunch of imbecilic, propaganda-spewing, anti-science establishment crazies, then let us settle this the good ol' American way. Let us create a free and fair forum for a lively and equitable debate. (And I do mean more that just posting opinions for reviews.) And to up the ante, let us take the debate to the classrooms of our great USA so that the facts - or lack thereof - may fight for themselves.<br /><br />If Ben is as IDiotic as half the reviews (um, comments) purport, then what does the Scientific community have to lose. Seriously! In fact it will just buttress their anti-God establishment. Won't it?<br /><br />Just a thought...
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Slam bang, rip roaring, old school comic book hero movie, that's ""Iron Man! The purest of comic book movies, who has a message, but does not overburden the audience with to much emotional baggage.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is ""Iron Man,"" he may be the brightest acting star of his generation, as he can play almost any part, & he plays the wealthy industrialist, swashbuckling, chick magnet, Tony Stark to perfection, with a wink of his eye! Jeff Bridges, who is also one of the greatest actors of his generation, plays the double dealing, money hungry, evil surrogate father figure, Obadiah Stane, of Tony Stark, with malicious glee, as he plans to take Tony's inventions & sell them to both sides of the fence. Tony's personal aid/secretary, Pepper Potts ( Gwyneth Paltrow) is perfect in her role as the faithful secretary, that is thinly disguises that she is in love with her boss. She is vulnerable, yet ready to take control of any situation that is bestowed on her with total competence. These three actors make ""Iron Man,"" sturdily solid, great popcorn entertainment for those who want to escape for a couple of hours in their lives!<br /><br />Recommended to everyone who loves a thrill ride of a film, with a great confrontational finale!"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This was the first movie we brought our 3-year-old son to see in the theater, and he loved it so much we had to pre-order it on amazon. We have since watched the DVD a million times, and it is still very fun for the family.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Good flick, Enjoyable, Very good effects, Could have had a better ending and selected a better actress for Snow White
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	For once I think I'd like to read a review that concerns the DVD version not the film... if I want to buy the DVD there's a good chance I don't care what someone thought of what was and wasn't left out but maybe what extra content there is in this particular version. Is it worth to buy the 2-disc collector's edition? Were there any extra features included that I really wouldn't want to miss? I wonder how many of these reviews for the 2-disc collector's edition were written by folks who bought and viewed it rather those that saw the movie and have something to say. I will come back and review once I have viewed the DVD and rate appropriately.<br /><br />Make it relevant please.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"After getting some uncalled for flack recently for his films ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"" director Martin Scorsese returns to those gritty mean streets he seems to know oh so well. How odd it is then to find out that the film did not come from Scorsese's imagination. Instead it is a remake of the 2004 Hong Kong action/thriller ""Infernal Affairs"". But, that doesn't really matter because Scorsese takes the material and makes it his own.<br /><br /> ""The Departed"" is going to get some unfair comparisons with ""Infernal Affairs"" from devoted fans of the original. I never like to do that. I also don't like when people compare the book to the movie version. Both pieces of work exist within their own world. They are seperate from each other.<br /><br /> Leonardo DiCaprio (the recent favorite of Scorsese, whom in my opinion needs to find a new muse already) plays Billy Costigan, who comes from a poor working class family that mostly consist of family member who were on the wrong side of the law (depending which side of the law you're on). He has managed though to work his way up and become a cop.<br /><br /> Matt Damon plays Colin Sullivan, who appears to be the exact opposite. Sullivan is one of those people who probably got straight ""A's"", stayed at home and studied while you were out playing baseball and was a loner. He too has become a police officer who is well thought of and clearly on a successful path.<br /><br /> These two characters never share a great amount of screentime together in ""The Departed"" but their impact on each other is apparent throughout the entire film.<br /><br /> Costigan is told by one of his superior officers Oliver Queenam (Martin Sheen) that because of his background he is not really ""police material"". Queenam flat out tells him you will never make it as a cop. So Queenam tells Costigan he has a special assignment for him. He wants Costigan to go undercover and get into Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) inner circle where the Boston Police have been trying to arrest him for years.<br /><br /> ""The Departed"" soon takes on one of Scorsese's favorite themes, childhood loyalty. Sullivan, back in his youth, became very friendly with Costello and now as a cop has turned into a crooker officer. How will the Boston police ever catch Costello?<br /><br /> The performances in ""The Departed"" are all pitch perfect. DiCaprio and Damon, who get top billing, are not just the only two worth watching. Even supporting characters like the ones played by Alec Baldwin and just so it's not all all boy's show, Vera Farmiga as Madolyn are both enjoyable to watch. But, perhaps the most memorable performances is the one given by Jack Nicholson. Rarely has an actor relished playing a villian moreso. The sheer exuberance of his performance makes the screen come alive. This isn't the Jack of recent films like ""Something's Gotta Give"" and ""About Schmidt"". Jack lets loose here and plays the role with the same spirit he did the Joker in ""Batman"". I would even go as far as saying every performance here deserves to get an Oscar nomination.<br /><br /> Some people may ask is this film as good as Scorsese's other films? That's a stupid question. Who cares? It seems, according to the reviews and box-office numbers (this marks Scorsese's highest box-office debut) people are responding well to this film. It is a powerful, well made gangster film that is about more than violence. As I said it is about loyalty and who we choose to give that loyalty to. This is one of the best films of the year! In fact the movie is so good I'm sure Scorsese will lose another Oscar race, just as his best films always do.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: One of the year's best films. ""The Departed"" finds Scorsese going back to the gritty mean streets of his past and makes this remake a work of his own. Every performance here deserves to get nominated."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I very rarely write movie reviews, mainly because I'm not that good at it, but I have to make an exception for this one.  ""Sin City"" is by far one of the most creative and stunningly well-made movies I've seen in quite some time.  I got the same  feeling from watching it as I did ""Kill Bill"", in that I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and couldn't stop thinking about it for days afterward, simply because it's so freaking good.<br /><br />First of all, there's the cinematography, which is just unbelievable.  The whole movie was filmed in a studio here in Austin, and nearly everything but the characters is digitally inserted.  They used basically no set for the whole thing, but everything looks so real (in a surreal kind of way).  And, the use of color is just brilliant.  The movie is mostly black and white, but other colors are sporadically thrown in for emphasis, and to brilliant effect.  The flashes of red blood, the cold, murderous stare of Elijah Wood, Alexis Bledel's gorgeous blue eyes, the vivid, um yellowness of the Yellow Bastard, all are brought out wonderfully amidst a black and white world.<br /><br />Now, just the special effects alone are enough to make this an entertaining movie, but it doesn't stop there.  The performances are all great as well.  I've never cared much for Mickey Rourke, but he does a spectactular job as the relentlessly vindictive Marv.  Bruce Willis has long shed his action hero image, for which he was once well-known, but here, he returns to that style with a vengeance (no ""Die Hard"" pun intended) as the hard-boiled Detective Hardigan.  Elijah Wood is just amazing as the silent but deadly Kevin, and of course we have Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, and many other lovely women with sedutive and memorable roles (I wish I'd known when they were filming this; so many girls I could have hit on ;).<br /><br />I don't want to reveal too much about the story, but basically it consists of several smaller stories, that all weave together into one larger plot.  The constant shifting of main characters, and the voice-over narrations of each one help to keep things interesting, and to demand your attention.  Much like ""Kill Bill"", it sort of skips around chronologically, but I think the story is initially much easier to follow overall.  And, like ""Kill Bill"", there's a lot of graphic, over-the-top violence, but the black and white sort of helps to dull it over a bit, so it doesn't really seem quite as gory as it is.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a fantastic movie that any fan of excellent cinema should see.  Robert Rodriguez has said that he wants to make movies of the entire ""Sin City"" series (and Johnny Depp is even slated to be in one), so I greatly look forward to the next installment."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I laught every time that I watch it. Jeff Dunham is one of the funniest people that I have seen in a while.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	My actual rating is MINUS 5 Stars.<br /><br />This movie was good up until the end.  What a major let down.  As another reviewer put it ... the ending leaves you pissed off, I mean really pissed off.  I wasted an evening of my life watching this film.  The useless ending ruined the entire movie.<br /><br />I find it totally unbelievable that so many people would rate this movie with more than 1 star, it deserves minus 5 stars because of the terrible ending.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Good movie. I was not expecting it to have any ties to the alien series but it did, and that was a plus for me. If you haven't bought it this is a good movie to add to your collection if you like science fiction. I wouldn't recommend letting children watch it since it does have a sexual scene in it.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"This is exactly what I expected from the man who brought us Goodfellas. Scorsese has created a masterpiece and its name is The Departed. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much walking into the theaters to see it, mostly due to the actors who star (DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg), but because of all the good things I had been hearing I decided to see it. ""Wow."" Was all I could say as I left the theater (same reaction from my two buds who tagged along) and called damn near everyone I knew who enjoyed a good movie. After this film I see all of the before mentioned actors in a whole new light. This film is definitely at the top of my favorites list!"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"This is one of the best social responsibility themed documentaries I have ever watched. I feel that this documentary covers all the bases on animal fair-treatment, the food safety impacts of industrial farming, and sustainable food production practices.<br /><br />Food Inc goes in depth on the production operations of a sustainable Virginia chicken, beef, and pork farmer. This farmer is probably at least a little eccentric, but everything he says about pigs exercising their ""pigness"" and cows being cows makes total sense. He invited the cameras in to see how he raises, feeds, and even slaughters the animals. The film treats very fairly the contrast between this approach and the approach that industrial-scale meat packer Perdue requires its farmers to follow.<br /><br />The film provides some focus to food safety, particularly as it relates to the role industrial processes play in promoting toxic e. coli proliferation. Alas, the film fails to make as clear a case for how e. coli has become such a problem as it has for the issues related to fair treatment of animals.<br /><br />I appreciated the film's exploration of public food subsidies and how they impact food choices and public health. We follow a low-income Los Angeles-area family that is forced to buy cheap fast food instead of broccoli due to price and time. To summarize, a hamburger would be more expensive, but corn, soybean, and wheat overproduction paid for by the US farm-subsidy bills feeds cows and keeps beef cheaper than it should be.<br /><br />There were pretty naive complaints of Monsanto's practice of prohibiting farmers from using the seeds that are naturally produced season after season on-farm by the plants it has engineered and patented. Monsanto prosecutes farmers doing this because this cuts into Monsanto's sales -- there's no reason to buy Monsanto's product if you can, in essence, re-use their product season after season. Unfortunately, the arguments were only skin deep and were akin to those that throw up their hands at the fact that pharmaceuticals cost so damn much money. Yeah, the seeds only cost a a tenth of a cent to produce, but the first seed cost $100 million, so what is Monsanto to do? Food Inc should have probed this issue deeper.<br /><br />I would encourage anyone watching the DVD-version to catch the extras. The deleted scenes could have easily been rolled into the feature but for length."

B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"Director Ridley Scott has again caused a stir among his fans with the spring 2012 release of ""Prometheus"", a science fiction/horror film which is ultimately a loose, muddled prequel to a much superior series of films: ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien Resurrection"". Scott also directed ""Alien"" which was released in 1979 and is now considered one of the great triumphs of the science fiction genre. The primary question seems to be whether this film ought to be judged against its predecessors or merited on its own. Ridley Scott situates himself among the greatest science fiction directors of all time: Stanley Kubrick (2001), Steven Spielberg (Close Encounters of the Third Kind), George Lucas (Star Wars) and John Carpenter (The Thing). My favorite film of Scott's is ""Bladerunner""; a Philip K. Dick adapted futuristic dystopia focusing on a grim and dark Los Angeles governed by detached corporation magnates. Scott put a tremendous amount of time and effort into this film. His potential for another great science fiction film is clear, and I suggest that it is quite relevant to measure a long-awaited prequel in relationship to Scott's earlier cinematic achievements. Consequently, I make no reservations that this response draws consistent parallels to Scott's earlier films.<br /><br />The cast is assembled with all of the hot new talent - Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw, the intrepid archeologist; her lover and fellow scientist, Charlie Holloway, played by Logan Marshall-Green; Michael Fassbender as David (the synthetic); and Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers, the cold yet pragmatic corporate supervisor whose focus never diverges from the interests of the Weyland Corporation. The very talented Guy Pearce pops up at the end as Peter Wayland himself, an odd casting decision that I think Scott should have taken more consideration of. The actors are all excellent and this ensemble really could have made the film work. In a science fiction movie of this scale, the cast's chemistry is crucial to the story, especially when we are thrilled at their every next move, either individual or collective. I found it hard to care or have compassion for any of the characters which is odd because these are A-list actors.<br /><br />The film lacks character development which is essential because we are instantly thrown into the idiosyncratic worlds of our heroes and are meant to experience their on-screen, scary situations just as they do. In ""Prometheus"" we are taken right into the action before we have a chance to get to know and to develop interest in the main characters. What makes ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" so special is the introduction of what would become an iconic action/sci-fi/horror hero in Sigourney Weaver. We are poised at her every move. She has energy, courage and resolve unmatched by any previous science fiction film protagonist. ""Ripley"" is truly what made the ""Alien"" series so special. Sigourney Weaver recast the role of women in not only science fiction movies, but across film genres. Noomi Rapace as Shaw simply lacks a main character's energy and enthusiasm. I yearned for a heroine that may if even in a small way match the magic of Ridley Scott's ""Ripley."" This was really disappointing. Following the Homer literary tradition, our hero must be strong and ready for any challenge!<br /><br />I was really looking forward to watching Guy Pearce in action. He is a phenomenal actor. He is sidelined and given very little on-screen time. Although Pearce is quite good as a morally-bankrupt mogul - the authority behind the whole mission - the question I kept asking myself is why not select an actor closer to Weyland's age. He is an old man. The makeup-job is poor and the plot trajectory does not allow for an interesting foray into Weyland's own story. Michael Fassbender is very good as Weyland's right hand and works in a sinister manner to try and help him achieve his goal of immortality.<br /><br />Reviewers are almost unanimously praising the movie's special effects. Yes. They are impressive. The world Scott creates here is rivaled only by the meticulous mind of James Cameron in his own recent creation: ""Avatar."" Special effects are commonplace among top films today and are often accepted as a compromise to an intelligent story, interesting characters and a smart script - screenplay. There has never been an occasion that Ridley Scott has not wowed us with his magnificent cinematography, complex sets and rich color palettes. ""Prometheus' "" special effects and visuals do not save the rest of its aspects which are lacking, and this is predictably so with most movies today.<br /><br />The film is also being praised for a so-called ""philosophical"" premise. What is this - that the film's awkward series of events will lead us to an ultimate conclusion regarding the beginnings of life on Earth? This intrigued me at first, but failed in the end. The films existential questions are at best inconspicuous. The second half of ""Prometheus"" moves us away from the answers and substitutes yet another typical formulaic ending - a failed mission, an anarchic crew, a last-minute take-off and a hero left unscathed. What is the relationship of the ""Humanoids"" to the ""Xenomorphs""? Why is there not even the smallest ounce of camaraderie among the crew? There are opposing agendas among all of the characters. If this was developed in much more detail the film may have really worked. The tenuous relationships between the characters should have been set up more carefully.<br /><br />As did many of my science fiction peers, I left the movie theater disillusioned with many questions and concerns. Some suggest that this is a good thing because it will enable us to revisit our curiosities when we see the next installment - Perhaps. But I find that when a first-of-a-series movie disappoints in so many ways it is always very difficult to redeem it in subsequent attempts. I wish Ridley Scott the best of luck. To his credit, the film has interested me enough to see if he succeeds next time."
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"It strikes me as funny that the ""star"" that this edition of the movie that Amazon.com opts to promote is Jessica Alba.<br /><br />Basically, Sin City is an adaptation of Frank Miller's series of graphic novels/comic books, which I haven't read.  What you'll find if you're not a comic/graphic novel geek is a compelling visual experience.  It has the standard Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarantino level of violence, so be careful.  This is an edgy, engaging journey through a different world.  What Rodriguez/Miller do with color and movement in the movie is really interesting.  The directors end up relying on the Tarantinoesque Pulp Fiction mode of semi-related stories to get through the movie, but the experience seems to me to be more aesthetic than narrative.<br /><br />Do the benefits of the ""Special Edition"" really add up to the cost?  I don't know.  I could barely tell the extra scenes that were in this addition, but I find that the many bonus features and the multitude of commentary tracks made this edition more worthwhile than the ""plain jane"" version."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I am reading the books now and its kind of differnt but  i love it and am so glad i purchased these. Def have to get the rest of the series!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	When I first saw Jeff Dunham's Arguing with Myself, I thought he was a wonderfully talented man.  He has done another great job of making me laugh once again with this video of his Comedy Central routine!  Bravo, Jeff!  Stand up comedy has a bright and shining star in you!
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	I enjoy this film every time I watch it. There was a lot of hype going into Iron Man, and the film satisfied nearly everyone. The action is just enough to please, and to leave the viewer wanting more. The film's pace is brisk and there is nearly no downtime. Downey Jr. perfectly portrays Tony Stark, an immature billionair turned empathetic hero. Jeff Bridges rarely plays a villain, but turns out a believable performance that is a good counterpart to Downey's character. Terrance Howard has a somewhat minor role, but Howard pulls it off greatly; it is too bad that he was replaced for the sequal. Paltrow's take as Stark's assistant is the heart of the film. I hope the sequal is just as good.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	"This is an excellent movie. It will grip you until the end. The entire cast come together in this brilliant adaptation of the clasic story.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098VYCCE"">Snow White & The Huntsman</a>"
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	Not much beats the gym for a good all-around workout. weights, cardio, etc. but these DVDs are a great workout when i cannot get to the gym. now that i started them, i want to see the program through so i purposefully haven't been to the gym. i feel like i'm working out different muscle groups as well.
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	This is the worst-quality DVD I've ever purchased. The color quality is awful, the skin tones are waxy and the animated scenes are pixel-ated. It was a great movie in the theater, but don't waste your money on this DVD.
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	Ok, first of all, I have read all the books but do not consider them literary classics. Rowling leaves a lot to the imagination, and when you write a screenplay adapation it gives you much more freedom to cherry-pick the best ideas of the novel. Alfonso Cuaron did a MARVELOUS job of this in Prisoner of Azkaban, which I feel is the best-made HP movie by a WIDE margin in terms of direction, cinematography, and being as true to the novel as possible. This movie, as others have so graciously pointed out, is extremely flawed in so many ways I pray that books 6 and 7 will have more competent screenwriters and they should pay Cuaron whatever it takes to direct the last book. That being said, the performances are the best since all the returning actors have perfected their roles to a T and Imelda should get an Academy Award nomination for her bit as Umbridge. I hope the final two get better treatment than this one did.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This is a great movie and a real eye opener. Makes me want to be vegan and support local organic farmers. I plan to share it with my family and friends.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"I really looked forward to this film, for several reasons including the fact it was a prequel to one of the best movies in my collection. I saw the display at the theater last year and had it on my list to buy from that point on. I don't do many movies in the theater. I prefer to buy them later on Blu-Ray and save the money. It's cheaper to own most movies than to take my wife and myself to the theater, and we can watch at our leisure.<br /><br />While I was waiting for delivery I started reading some of the reviews and found out it left a lot to be desired. It was a good movie, and since I no longer expected it to be on the same level as Alien, I enjoyed it. I try to watch movies for the entertainment value alone, and if it is something I really enjoy then go back and watch to see if I can find deeper meaning and mistakes. Knowing some of this movies mistakes ahead of time made it a little harder to do that, but, it made me understand I should not expect quite the movie I'd planned to see.<br /><br />That being said, it was a good movie. It was entertaining, it did have some character build out. The affects were great, it was fun to see the ship design, the image of the ""Engineer"" in his control seat with his helmet on that matched what we saw in Alien on the crashed ship. The shape of the ships, the development of the creatures as they assimilated DNA from their hosts. Even the corridors in the base brought back images from the Alien movie.<br /><br />I recommend this movie, BUT, I recommend you sit down to watch it without the assumption you will be blown away like the first Alien movie did. If you approach it looking for an entertaining movie, you should enjoy it as well."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"I like Ben Stein, and the trailer for the movie looked funny.  Then I read the reviews on Amazon and from different movie critics and thought, ""if so many people hate this movie with such unholy passion, it must be worth seeing.""<br /><br />I am an academic.  Having said that, my professional colleagues in many cases do not come out of this movie looking like more than highly-educated stooges, repeating the mind-numbing litany of ""Darwinism is all we need.  Darwin explained God.  We need no god.  All we need is what science has given us and continues to give us.  All hail Science.""<br /><br />As someone that works in the social sciences, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about.  This was highly interesting, very entertaining, and frankly, frightening.  There is no doubt that the sort of blinkered, philistine, pig-ignorance highlighted in this movie is fairly common in the scientific community.  What is disturbing, however, is not just the way in which the social Darwinists are so determined to uphold a standard (Darwinism) that is obviously flawed even to many of them.  The truly horrifying aspect of this film was the jihadist approach taken by those same scientists in relation to Intelligent Design: ""IT IS HERESY.  IT MUST BE STAMPED OUT.  DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE ID PEOPLE.  THEY ARE EVIL.  THEY WANT TO CONTROL YOUR LIVES WITH GOD AND RELIGION AND.....""<br /><br />Thank you, Ben Stein, and company, for not only making this film, but having the courage to put it out there."
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"I thought this was okay...not the revised updated character like Sly Stallone did with Rocky Balboa and John Rambo. I think the problem here is George Lucas. This guy has not been relevant since the Empire Strikes Back!! Keep George out of the next one...and get some new ""eyes"" for the next time. Yes, there needs to be another try. I don't want the bad taste of this latest one to linger in my memory!!"
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	There are things I liked about Martin Scorcese's The Departed - it's grittiness, the tough, Irish Boston atmosphere, the dialogue, most of the performances (particularly Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, DiCaprio and MATT DAMON) and the plot which, despite some holes, is engaging.  Having said all that, The Departed is good but far from great.  Why?  It's shallow, none of the characters have any real depth to them, it's flabby and bloated, Jack Nicholson is basically on over-the-top , one-dimensional cruise control, and the closing shot of the film with the rat is completely unnecessary and possibly one of the clumsiest attempts at symbolism I've ever seen in a film.  I also think the camera work was good, but wasn't up to par with Scorcese's previous work, and the quick editing bothered me after a while.  I think the most disappointing thing about the Departed is that after you finish it you're entertained but at the same time you're left feeling that the film should and could easily be a lot better than it is. 3 1/2 stars out of five.
B002QZ1RS6	3.0	b	"Let me start off by giving a frame of reference: I'm 43 years (God that was painful to type...), 5' 10"" and 170 lbs. I'm a pretty fit guy who's engaged in regular physical activity since high school. I've done weight training, mountain biking, yoga and several martial arts. At 35 I started training in Muay Thai, so I'm no stranger to a brutal workout routine. I'm also a proud graduate of ""P90X"". Like many others, I truly loved that program and it revolutionized the way I approach fitness. It made me a Beach Body fan for life.<br /><br />A few months ago, I started training in parkour and realized how ill-equipped I was for ""The Movement"". So, I turned to Beach Body and Shawn T to help me get into shape for my new hobby. For the most part...it worked. But a few things caught my attention.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Insanity Delivered - I got the results I wanted. My Rest Heart Rate and waistline went down while my plyometric ability and conditioning have shot up. And though I may not have nearly the grace the parkour ""traceaurs"" do, at least I can clear most obstacles.<br /><br />No Additional Equipment Required - All you need for ""Insanity"" (aside from a DVD player and viewer) are some good workout clothes, your own body and some serious determination.<br /><br />Great Recipes - Although I didn't strictly follow the diet, I have toyed with some of the recipes in the meal book. They're pretty good tasting...AND good for you!<br /><br />Easy on the Eye - Each DVD features attractive, telegenic people, all of whom appear to be Fitness Professionals (trainers, dancers, runners, etc). Many even appear in other Beach Body productions<br /><br />Short Workouts- During the first month of the program, the majority of the workouts will about 40 minutes long. They get to around 60 minutes during the second month.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Not a Balanced Workout - As other reviewers have stated, this workout puts tremendous focus on cardio and lower body with hardly any on upper body or strength training. I've read reviews suggesting that one intersperse strength training (possibly P90X)with Insanity cardio. Not a bad thought...<br /><br />Extremely Hard on the Joints - Again, all the other reviews (even the five star ones) raise this point. While I didn't injure anything per se, ""Insanity"" definitely put undue strain on my knees, hips and lower back...especially during the so-called ""Recovery Week"" (more on that below). Be warned; this is a high impact set of very repetitive movements.<br /><br />Can Become Tedious - By the time you've reached the third week, you've pretty much seen it all. After that, it's merely different combinations of the same basic moves. After a while, it can become a bit of a grind to go through them over and over and OVER again.<br /><br />Not Very Inspiring - ""Insanity"" is basically a workout that nobody can do. Watching closely, I realized none of the people in the video were actually able to complete a session. Everybody, including Shawn T. himself took frequent breaks, completely lost their form or just started ""doggin' it"" (as Tony Horton would say). Okay, that's a testament to the intensity of the routine. But if even these Fitness Professionals can't get through this thing, what have I?<br /><br />Shawn T Didn't Really Click for Me - Maybe I miss Tony Horton's goofy, self effacing sense of humor, but I just couldn't get into Shawn T.'s style. I found him loud and a trifle annoying. He also didn't do a very good job explaining the logic or science behind his routines.<br /><br />""Recovery Week""??? - This workout flat out confounded me, so I welcome any insight. This so called ""Recovery Week"" consists of same workout for six straight days in a row. I fail to see the benefit of doing repetitive high stress (though low impact) movements every day without giving your muscles time to heal. By about the fourth day, my knees, hip flexors and quadriceps were so sore, I had to abandon the workout for the rest of the week.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />Even at moderate intensity, it's almost impossible NOT to get some sort of positive results from ""Insanity"" since you're doing cardio in six-day blocks. Going forward, I'll probably head back to the gym on strength days and mix in the ""Insanity"" DVDs on cardio days.<br /><br />I have to say, it did help me reach my fitness goals. But not without some lingering pains in my joints."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Robert Downey Jr. once again shows why he is a truly gifted actor. Great movie! Cant wait for the next installment!!!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"It is so refreshing.  Does not follow what hollywood thinks is ""cool"" today.  It really makes you exam the what is going on in our own schools and government."
B000S5KGH4	1.0	b	Just wanted to let all the parents know that there is plenty of profanity here.  I know most probably won't care, or already know this going in, but if you don't like bad language, stay away.
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	"Okay, so I don't understand the Coen brothers crap that they give to Hollywood. I still don't see why Tommy Lee Jones was even cast in this movie. Yeah, yeah....old men, times change, people change; and all that rubbish.<br /><br />The story was really about Josh Brolin (Llewelyn) who stumbles upon an a large amount of cash from an aborted drug deal gone bad between a bunch of dealers and buyers (everyone's dead on the scene, except one guy in a truck - he's later killed. But not by Brolin). And the Psycho killer, Anton (Javier Bardem) who goes around capping off people shooting bolts into their foreheads, or blowing them away with a suppressed shotgun (right) in his attempts to recover the cash that Llewelyn has taken. Anton acts like sort of an automaton throughout the movie. Sometimes flipping a coin to see if he'll take the life of his next victim (the victim is supposed to ""call it"". Uh-boy.<br /><br />Leewelyn's girlfriend, Carla Jean (played by Kelly MacDonald) was a really annoying stereotype of ""trailer trash,"" with a double-digit I.Q. to boot. Seemingly spaced-out and unable to do any thinking on her own. Or maybe it was because she was so used to taking orders from Llewelyn (who cares).<br /><br />Woody Harrelson plays a short part (that's right, he gets blown away by Anton) hunting Anton and trying to get the money back from Llewelyn without really wanting to kill him.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones goes about the movie blabbering lines and contemplating this and that....oh my gosh, you really have to be into this existential garbage that the actors are attempting to convey to the audience. I got it - it was just plain stupid.<br /><br />The killer gets away in the next to the last scene. And then we see good 'ol Ed Tom who blathering to his wife about a dream. Oh, help me. I can see why it grossed ONLY $74 mil. With the exception of the shootout between Anton and Llewelyn - Bad movie. Lousy Movie."
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Very poor directing made for a disappointing movie. All the ingredients were there, but I'm not sure the director had the vision. The ending was stupid; what was with the long . . . take on Kristen Stewart with that ridiculous expression? I like Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, but even they couldn't save this one. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this at the theatre.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	Love this movie!  A must see movie!  Hate these kinds of releases though.  I'm waiting for the Dec 2 disc release with all of the extras.  The only thing I'm happy about is that they told us another deluxe DVD was coming.  It doesn't make the wait any easier though.  I was anxiously awaiting this movie on DVD, but now I have to wait until December.  I guess I might rent the DVD so I can watch the movie again, but I'm tired of buying movies and then having a deluxe version coming out later.  Hellboy, Daredevil, X-men 1.5, etc...  We have to get the industry to stop this.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"The next anticipated movie from the Marvel line of comic books is ""IRON MAN"". There has been an overload of comic book films and thankfully, this one doesn`t have ""Fantastic Four`s"" quality. ""Shellhead"" goes to the big screen courtesy of director Jon Favreau with a solid screenplay by Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby. Yes, the movie is great and as with ""Spider-Man"" is the cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be. Yes, everything but it didn't quite unseat ""Spider-man 2"" as Marvel's best comic adaptation. (in my opinion)<br /><br />Anthony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a billionaire industrialist/inventor and dubbed as a ""Merchant of War""; Stark makes most of his fortune making weapons for the military. One day, fate intervenes and Stark finds himself captured and injured by terrorists. With the aid of a man named Yinsen (Shaun Toub), Stark creates a suit of armor from scratch and escapes the clutches of the terrorists.<br />This experience had apparently affected Stark in a life-changing way. Now he intends to use his resources to the betterment of mankind, much to the dismay of Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). To atone for his sins, Stark builds a steel-mesh suit and becomes the ultimate human fighting machine...<br /><br />When I said that the film is a cardboard cutout of everything a comic book film should be, it is because the screenplay carries references to the Shellhead's comic series from his very origin. Never try to ""fix"" something that's not broken. The backdrop has been changed from Vietnam to Iraq; and this is a very clever move since it does relate to current events. Characters from the comic make a appearance; Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Yinsen, Obadiah Stane (strong references to ""Ultimate Iron Man""), Jarvis the robotic assistant (Jarvis the butler was probably avoided due to similarities to Batman's Alfred) and Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard). S.H.I.E.L.D., ""War Machine"" and the Avengers Initiative anyone? The film carried a surmountable amount of teases that can have the avid comic fan very excited. Writers Fergus and Ostby definitely did their homework on this one.<br /><br />All these factors and the solid direction by Favreau makes for a very entertaining fun movie. The direction has near-excellent structure. I didn't notice any plot holes at all and the execution is solid, the direction knew exactly what it wanted to do and sticks to it. This can be a double-edged sword and I'll explain in a minute. I truly commend the first act of the film as Stark is portrayed as a man very much in for himself who realizes the consequences of his inventions. Why is it so much easier to invent weapons of destruction than to make things to advance mankind? The film does have a strong moral message and a nice touch of humanity. We're fallible, but what matters is how we make our following choices.<br /><br />The film is also blessed with a great cast. Downey does make a good Tony Stark, and the supporting cast does mesh well. Gwyneth Paltrow's ""Pepper Potts"" may seem a little ""doopie"" but I rather thought that it was her character in the comic. Tony is a playboy and boy, I was very amused by his escapades. Hopefully, the cast is signed for its sequel. The action scenes are decently shot and the best one I think is Shellhead's invasion into enemy territory. The battle with ""Iron Monger"" is a little short and not exactly as bone-crushing as I would've preferred it to be but I suppose it fits the film's pace. Boy, the CGI can trample the EFX in ""Tranformers"". Shellhead is a ""global"" super-hero with concerns that surpass bank robberies and criminals.<br /><br />Now, before anything else, let me make it very clear that I really thought that ""Iron Man"" is a great movie. Great structure, AMAZING special effects that puts most CGI to shame and clever dialogue. But the film seemed too `safe"" and while the script was very good, it just didn't feel that it was willing to take risks and somehow, I think it didn't realize its full potential. The villain is a little underwhelming and as to be expected, the hero will encounter his exact opposite, that ends up being predictable. Just who is Obadiah Stane in the comic book? He is the man who trampled Stark to the ground and drove him to alcoholism. The man should be cunning and evil, not reduced to a power hungry, greedy businessman.  As great as the movie is, it just didn't offer any surprises and I felt like I was just watching just another ""super-hero"" movie and I`m ready for the next one. Maybe if this came before the first ""Spider-man"" (that launched the super-hero new wave) then this film would be just awe-inspiring. The film just put me in very familiar territory that I really felt as if it was the same old thing. Some scenes proved too silly for my tastes but it was still entertaining. Are these signs of super-hero overdose?<br /><br />Despite the feeling of ""super-hero"" burnout, the villain becoming too routine and with the film being too ""safe"" for its own good, I really believe ""Iron Man"" is still a great effort in the super hero genre. At least, it knew what it wanted to do; entertain the young and old alike. The film is not pretentious and despite the limits it imposed on itself, the film is a very entertaining and a great summer film. Undoubtedly, this film will stand as one of the best super-hero flicks to grace movie theaters.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! [4  stars]<br />This review was drafted in June 2008."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	This is the my first review on amazon, although I have been shoppng here for 4 years. When i went to see this in the theaters, I was a little wary because of some of the actors in it. After leaving the theater, I saw those actors in a new light. If your reading this review, then your thinking of buying it. Just do it. I cant relay how good this movie is through the phenomonal acting, directing, and story. 5 stars......anyone who says different, I WILL fight you!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	As a person that attends movies on a weekly bases, I definitely agree that Iron Man movie was the num #1 movie of 2008, followed or pretty much tied with the Batman movie: Dark Knight. I'm really huge on comic books turned movies as long as there done the right way, and so I'm glad to give this movie 5 stars & definitely glad to own it on Blu-Ray. The Blu-Ray dvd came in a timely manner as stated so I appreciate that.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	THE MOVIE WAS NOT BAD, BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER AND HAD MORE ACTION. THE MAIN ACTRESSES WERE VERY GOOD. MAYBE THEY SHOULD BRING OUT PART 2 WITH MORE MAGIC SPELLS AND MYSTERY.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	While the original OOTP book was not the worst of the series (that honor goes to the 2nd book, COS, and from it COS the film is easily the worst of the HP films even though it featured the least amount of the appalling Emma Watson but did feature way too much Rupert Grint), reading OOTP was like sitting through a big budget movie that goes nowhere. OOTP as a book was long but didn't really have much of a plot. Oh, it sure did ridicule the government and offered a lot of teen angst moments, but the story was more less non-existent. Ironically, OOTP was the longest book yet it is the shortest of the HP films, perhaps WB's reaction to criticism of the first two films being too long & slow.<br /><br />Well, Daniel Radcliffe is still a fine Harry, better than his sidekicks anyway. Grint wasn't as annoying as he was in past films, but he has nothing to do and nothing funny to say (granted, Ron was nothing but an emotional punching bag for Harry by this point). Emma Watson as usual is just plain annoying, coming off as a spoiled school princess instead of a well meaning book worm.<br /><br />Imelda Stanton is well cast as the obnoxious Umbridge, and Evanna Lynch is spot on as Luna Lovegood. The lack of Sirius is a crime though, and some scenes didn't have enough emotion. Still, at least it doesn't drag on forever.<br /><br />The eye candy is glossy as always.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"Race car Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) has had a fantastic rookie season and could easily become the first rookie to win the coveted Piston Cup.  All he has to do is win the run off race against veteran The King (Richard Petty) and perpetual runner up Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton).  If he can do that, he might be able to get a new sponsor.  After all, being the spokescar for Rust-Eze is a little embarrassing for a sleek racecar like Lightning.<br /><br />On the way to the big race in Los Angeles, Lightning accidentally gets separated from his transport truck and finds himself in Radiator Springs, where he accidentally destroys the road.  Much to his dismay, he's sentenced to repave the road before he can continue on the way.<br /><br />Radiator Springs is the town that time forgot.  A former way station on the famous Route 66, it is barely surviving now that the big interstate has been build nearby, making stopping there no longer necessary.  Of course, this is exactly the type of town Lightning wants to avoid.  He's living life in the fast lane and just wants to get on his way.<br /><br />But to complete his community service, he has to deal with the locals.  Mater the Tow Truck (Larry the Cable Guy) quickly labels Lightning his best friend and wants to help him have a good time.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is cute and distracts the rather single focused Lightning.  In fact, everyone in town seems to enjoy having Lightning around.  Everyone but Doc Hudson (Paul Newman).  What kind of secret might he have?  And will Lightning take what he is learning to heart?<br /><br />This movie might bore kids.  More so then other Pixar films, the main conflict is internal, focused on what Lightening is learning from his experiences in Radiator Springs.  There is a villain, but he gets little screen time.  And this is the first movie to not have on of Pixar's patented climaxes that will not quit.<br /><br />All this isn't to say that the movie is bad.  I saw it twice in the theater, and loved every minute of it both times.  The story is ultimately heartwarming, the characters endearing, and the movie is funny.  The tractor-tipping scene alone is guaranteed to make you laugh.  Plus there is lots of fun during and after the final credits.<br /><br />And then there's Pixar's attention to detail.  Watching the car's backup lights turn on and off or the bugs being VW Beetles, for example, add to the charm.  The animation in the movie is flawless, and many of the scenery shots are absolutely breathtaking.  If I didn't know better, I would say they were real.  This is a movie to watch on the big screen for those shots alone.<br /><br />Surprisingly, this is the first Pixar film not to get a two disc special edition.  Frankly, I find that disappointing.  Still, the movie looks and sounds wonderful.  There's a new short with Mater, deleted scenes, and the ""One Man Band"" short that showed in theaters before this movie.<br /><br />While kids might not find it as engaging as Pixar's other films, they will enjoy it.  The lack of extras is disappointing, but the film more then makes up for it.  This is another triumph for Pixar."
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	I was waiting for This moive to be released and when fliping through my Amazon Account i noticed it on the instant video on demand. I grabed it right away Which was a mistake the Video quality is total Grabage. I Paid for the Reg version $14.99. I'll never buy another instant video Again. no refunds no fixs.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	I am not a fan of Robert Downey Jr., but he is a great actor in this role.<br />Tony Stark (Iron man), a scientist specialized in weapon development, is kidnapped by terrorists, and during his hostage, he creates an Iron man to his escape and soon the Iron man becomes his new identity.  Upon his return, he decides to lead himself to a new direction but a weapon developer. His decision accidentally moves him closer to unveil a nasty truth and also exposes his assistant, Pepper Potts (Paltrow) in danger.<br /><br />The character of Iron man fits Robert Downey Jr. who is not afraid of authority, witty, brilliant, and ultimately makes this flick a gem.<br /><br />Iron man definitely brings a different atmosphere amongst the superheros who are usually low-profile and secretive such as superman, batman, and spiderman.<br />Additionally, Iron man shows himself in box office just in a right time since we are a tad fed up with the aforementioned superhero sequels.<br />(at least I am ...)
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Love the movie, great for a family night.  Can be enjoyed by all ages
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	The DVD was in perfect condition. It came in the time frame that they said with would. No complaints here!
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Great movie!  Now that we've seen it, we are definitely adding it to our collection! Great action and the cast is amazing!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I have shared Arguing With Myself with many family members and friends and it is popular with one and all. Peanut and Walter are especially delightful.  I do not like the interruptions of Sweet Daddy Dee from the green room and such.  I thought those bits added nothing and were distracting from the flow of the show.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	I was expecting it be more along the story but as usual the movie industry glamorized it with their own twist on the original. No worth buying. Charlize was awesome I it she made the movie as others have said.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"The fifth instalment of the Harry Potter series is not an easy read. It deals with death and loneliness and the ""age of nobody understands me"". Despite facing death for the first time in the fourth book, this is the first time Harry is facing the aftermath of death and learning how to deal with death itself. The theme was clear right from the beginning when he saw the ""winged creatures with bones on their bodies"" drawing the carriage and nobody except Luna, who had seen death, could see it.<br /><br />David Yates managed to capture all these very well in his vision of the Harry Potter world. It is dark all through and the loneliness of the boy wizard that creeps in from time to time does show that the audience should now be ready for something more epical and drastic coming. Book five is a bridging book of the series and it is not easy to please anyone. So is the film. Critics have not been easy on the movie itself but a more closely look to the book, and then you will be able to appreciate more about the movie. There were lots of details from the book that were left out because of the natural confinement of the movie medium itself, but it does keep a lot of the originalities inside. The rendenz-vous with Luna is more memorable as compared to the book, but the whole nerdiness of the character was gone. Luna became a creepy, calm but very interesting character and Evanna Lynch did a fair job, considering the substantial change to the character in the script. The importance of the Order itself was shifted in the movie. As a result they became side line story instead and all the relationships among the people in the Order became unimportant in the movie. So if you are up for the Order you might be disappointed. However, it seems like the new Order is formed under the Dumbledore Army is being the new theme of the movie. The passing of the baton became very important as compared to the book. The more mentioned character in the Order is undoubtedly Sirius Black but that is understandable, considering his pivotal role in the book itself. However, the way he showed up in the flame this time is different as compared to Goblet of Fire. That might be the sort of details producers need to look at - how can the same magic performed by the same person in the same space look completely different between the two movies?<br /><br />Daniel, Rupert and Emma gave a fair performance but really in this movie they didn't really shine. Daniel looks angry all the time. Yes, the character is supposed to be angry but not superficially with an angry face and just panting heavily with a few water drops on his face. If his performance as an actor in Equus receives critical acclaim, sure he should be able to deliver more in Half Blood Prince. But again, is Harry a demanding character to perform? The screen stealer is no doubt Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge. Her appearances showed a well interpretation of aggressive gentleness - and she is not shy to deploy that on her students. Emma Thompson brief appearances were still very enjoyable although in the book her character is more important than in the movie. But again, the movie is now more about the younger generation.<br /><br />The special effects are up to standard as usual but a lot of familiar things are back, e.g. the moving staircases and of course the centaurs. The battle at the Ministry is a well orchestrated end to the movie and the swift movements between the Death Eaters and the Order certainly are cool eye candies for the movie. The youngster also played out well as the successors of the Order for the future. The battle between the opposites - light and darkness, fire versus water, were well done, though a bit obvious. The score of the movie is spectacular and captures the emotion of the movie extremely well. That added a lot of substance to the movie itself. For the well, kissing scene, it is just really overrated. Maybe it is an impact for kids, but for adults, it is just another kissing scene.<br /><br />Squeezing the book into a 2 hours or so movie is not an easy task. David Yates sure did a good job for the book. The book itself was not an easy read, so the movie will not be an easy watch for a lot of people, especially if you are expecting a standard Harry formula of just imaginary fantasy, because the fantasy is over. What is in stall for the audience this time is some serious action that will cause the lives of a number of characters in the upcoming finale. The Potter movie has grown out of the kids premises and like all teenagers' coming of age, it is not easy to handle and appreciate."
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	One of the sad realizations i have come to in the recent years of movie production (and a possible reason ticket sales are at an all time low as of late) is found in Hollywood creativity and new ideas. Sadly, there just isn't any, and if you think Movies are lacking fresh ideas, turn on the TV set after reading this review, but i digress.<br /><br />In my years of movie watching i have enjoyed a variety of movies that set the standard in regards to their genre of story telling. For example as far as star sagas and wars are concerned nothing will likely come close to Star Wars, as far as horror in space, ALIEN might well have the title there, demon possession, one only need watch the Exorcist in the dark alone, where the battle of man against machine, i guess is a throw up between Terminator and The Matrix. Such movies have set the bar relatively high with the quality of their stories; thus leaving other movies with similar topics often to seem like cheap imitators. (Now to all you people who are saying get to the point, the movie review)<br /><br />For quite a while i would have easily said that Pulp Fiction set the bar pretty high in regards to the brand of producing that had multiple stories all tied together. However, it would appear that Sin City took a great idea and just made it better. This movie takes a style of talk and feel of the 30's, mixed colorization of the 60's, violence and sex of...... well pick a year I'm sure it will fit, and the special affects of the 90's and beyond, and rolls it all together into a visual masterpiece. In this movie you will see Mickey Rourke play one of his best roles ever as Marv. Sadly (although i love his work) Bruce Willis play his traditional role of the down and out cop who breaks the rules to save the day (he played it well in this movie but not really a stretch for him) and although his role was small, the most mesmerizing role might well be found in a Fine Young Cannibal named Kevin (Elijah Wood) (sorry for the spoiler).<br /><br />The one fine point i liked about Pulp Fiction was in the Karma to be found within the story, in that in the end everyone pretty much gets what they deserve and that sometimes the people we believe to be good really ain't so good at all, and it takes a unique, sometimes nasty form of justice to make things right. Such a point touched on in Pulp, is the center of SIN CITY in a nutshell.<br /><br />Is it the best movie ever?........no, but it may be one of the best of its kind. If you are the type that can't appreciate the story, just go into it for the sheer artistic and creative value this movie presents and i think you will be moderately pleased. Oh if you didn't already know this movie is not for the squeamish.<br /><br />The only disappointing aspect after watching this movie is knowing i might have to wait another 5 to 10 years for another fresh idea to come out of Hollywood to set a new standard and make me want to return to the theaters.<br /><br />P.S. Hollywood Moguls looking for a fresh idea (A Marv prequel)
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	Why it was decided that the longest Harry Potter book should become the shortest movie, I will never understand. Well, maybe I do understand: greed. It's certainly cheaper to produce a shorter film!<br /><br />Throughout the plot development was uneven. I sometimes wondered what happened to many of the incidents from the book which would have tied the action together. The Devil is in the details: we never did find out what that arch in the Ministry really was, and we should have. But that is only one of the shortcomings of the film.<br /><br />Read the book before you see the film, so that the film makes sense.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Alright, I am not here to take you through a step by step synopsis of the movie. I have been reading Marvel comics for as long as I remember and have basically experienced the rise and fall of their illustrious movie career. I lost faith after Spidey 3 and Ghost Rider and when I heard Iron Man was coming out I nearly hung myself. I watched it last night and I nearly cried for Marvel has redeemed itself finally. The movie was awesome, the dialog was snappy and the fact that they did not concentrate on the armor was excellent also. And when they mentioned S.H.I.E.L.D at the end, I jumped for joy because Marvel finally incorporated another part of their universe into one of their movies. Now my faith in Marvel has been restored and you know what, I started collecting and reading comic books again. I feel the fan boy coming back and I love it. I hope they don't massacre the sequel and I pray they don't massacre the Avengers, Thor and the Punisher War Zone. FANBOYS UNITE!!!!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I have 2 dvd from Jeff and love them both. This guy is wild. Would like to see him live.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"I hated the ""sixth sense"" and I thought the ""Signs"" was even worse. To my amazement, I really enjoyed the ""Village"". This is very creepy and suspensful and it doesn't let up until the end. I guess its a matter of opinion since my husband was bored to tears through the whole thing."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	True Blood is the best of 2009. It brings a whole new view of vampires. Creating a whole new story line T.V. has never aired before getting the whole series isn't gonna be something to regret!!!!!!!!!!!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I'm new to the True Blood phenomenon and I'm glad I finally got on the band wagon.  I'm now up to season 4 episode 5.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	a thoroughly enjoyable movie by the remarkable coen brothers.<br />right up there with their classic 'fargo.'<br />i read the cormac mccarthy book right before seeing the film and i concur with the academy about the excellent job the coen's did in tranferring the novel to the big screen.<br />the values of the old are mostly forgotten by the young and our society is paying for that.<br />anton chigurh is evil incarnate and there is no destroying evil and sheriff tom bell knows this.<br />this is a cynical movie, based on cynical times in a cynical world!<br />cormac mccarthy and the coens have created the ultimate documentary about<br />our modern society which lacks any kind of moral compass.<br />btw, i,too, wonder about the inherent nature of humanity, when one can not<br />spell 'awful.'
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I have never seen my daughter laugh so hard!  She was actually rolling on the floor with tears running down her face; she finally asked me to stop the DVD before she wet herself.  I know, too much information, but it was that good.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"This is a great movie...very unorthodox from most movies...The pace is slow and then...wham!!! The Cast was perfect and the setting was great!!! I haven't seen this great a villain since ""The Musketeer""!!!<br />I do wish the ending wasn't as dry as they made it...It had nothing to do with the movie!!! Besides that...everything went perfect in this movie!!! A must see!!!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I believe that losing weight is most peoples goal, but this program requires rigorous determination and discipline because it is downright hard. Its hard work and while I believe you will see results with just following the workout schedule, it wont do much good if you are continuing to eat trash, so you have to be committed to the program AND eating healthier.  Results will always vary, but the workouts are SO intense that I thought I could get away with just watching what I ate, around 1500-1700 calories most of the time, following as much of the recipes I could follow but not leaving my chocolate cravings behind. In 60 days, without skipping one workout or shutting the dvd off early, I only lost 5 pounds. But I lost inches in places I needed too, my thighs, waist and love handles and I started the dvd's at the point where I needed to lose my last 15 pounds, so it's stubborn stubborn weight (in my case). I have had 4 kids, had only run 2 miles at a time at a mediocre pace, quit P90X early, done a bit of Turbo Jam and Chalean Extreme in the year leading up to starting Insanity. So I basically started with only a little cardio endurance, very little muscle and little motivation. I was sore for the first 3 workouts, and the dvds got tougher but it was easier to turn on the program, I set out a time each day (the first 30 days was in the AM before my kids woke up, the last 30 days had to be at night since the dvd's get longer) and found I was mentally committed even when I was sore or lazy. I have 4 kids, I had guilt free pregnancies, and did not try to lose all the weight gained in between each, and my last child turned 1 when I started. I believe anyone with a healthy body can do this, complete it and be proud. I highly suggest purchasing Asylum as soon as you start month 2, I found once I finished Insanity, I continued the workouts but at my own combinations, I was not as motivated because I got bored, I knew what the expect. Asylum took it to another level, so if youre looking to thin out, and then get lean muscle, that's the route to go. I am starting the Insanity Asylum hybrid next week and I couldn't be more excited about my results... am I at my goal weight yet? No, but Im getting there, Im eating WAY better, less on the snacking, less on the sweets and my results are WAY better than when I was just doing Insanity. I DO NOT like working out, but I DO like fitting in clothes I fit in before I had any kids, I do like having some upper arm definition, I do like having abs, and not feeling self conscious in skinny jeans, I am proud to say I am an Insanity graduate. Its worth it, and its even more worth it if you make the lifestyle change nutritionally with it.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Must see if you belive in god. People who do not belive in god can still watch it and start to belive in god.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	It is one of the funniest comedy acts I've seen.  He is great.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Prompt and speedy service.  Received the video within a few days in perfect condition.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	My family tends to lean toward the darker, moodier films that go against the norm and this did not disappoint. I am not a particular fan of Stewart, but the storyline of this movie made it worth my two hours and eight minutes. The cinematography was good enough for my liking and at the end of the day, that's what counts - whether or not I liked it, not everyone else. I would give it five stars, but that seemed overly biased. As yes, for the type of film it was, I liked Mirror, Mirror too.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Ok, everyone before me has written all the details about the film so I'll get right to it.  In summary, this is the best Harry Potter film to date...at least for adults.  The pacing, plot, and special effects are all true to the book and make for a very enjoyable ride.  I hope the next two films can keep up with this quality!<br /><br />Yes, the film follows the book very closely picking out the highlights.  However, this means it is darker than the previous films and really is aimed at older Potter Fans.  You may not want to let young children see this until they are older or nightmares may be in their future.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Best action scene in the film is when the pit bull chases the guy through the river. Those things don't quit.<br /><br />Best laugh is when Chigurh fails to kill the trailer park manager. She is the one person you would kill too, the one person you want to see killed, the one person you know he will certainly kill (wha- where's your air tank, pal?).  But she backs him up and then the confrontation is broken off with a toilet flush.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Never watched it. I overheard my daughter tell someone she loves this movie and wants to get it so I surprised her with it.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	As with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, they have chosen to leave out parts which I wonder how they will justify in book 7's movie. Overall, enjoyed the movie. Added to my collection of Harry Potter material.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I fell in love with this series while it was airing for the first time on HBO.  Having read the books I think this is one of those rare times where the series is just as good as the book.  Charlaine Harris does a wonderful job creating the world of Sookie Stackhouse and her magical friends.  I love the direction that Alan Ball took the series, making it his own without losing the foundation that Charlaine Harris created.  Awesome series, I have watched it over and over and cannot wait until season 2 comes out in July.  One of my all time favorite series.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	That is one of the better lines Peanut has.  All of them are hilarious & the best part is in the bloopers.....its Peanut & that's all I'm gonna say about that, go watch it, totally hilarious!
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	"I was so excited for Snow White & The Huntsman to come out; not because of Stewart and her Twilight involvement, but for the simple fact that the trailer looked amazing.  I should have stuck with the trailer.  The costumes and cinetography are as beautiful as the trailer would have you believe but the acting and script are subpar.  I would watch it again but only with the mute button on and if we can skip Stewart's classic and always there ""oh no.  What should I do?"" face.  Even when she rides to battle and is supposed to be a strong heroine, she has her ""I'm conflicted"" face on.  I think I may hate her as the heroine even more than the script.  By the end of the movie, I was bored and secretly wanted the Snow White to die again just to spice up the movie."
B0006989TE	4.0	b	MOVIE: Boy, oh boy is it hard writing a review for this movie without giving away anything that will ruin it for the audience. Let me start off with this, DO NOT GO INTO THIS MOVIE EXPECTING THE SIXTH SENSE OR SIGNS! If you do you will guarantee yourself with a dissapointment. This movie shows a different side of M. Night Shyamalan, the more poetic and literary side of him rather than the dark and suspenseful side. Don't get me wrong, you're guaranteed to jump more than once and there is a handful of tense moments, but the truth of the movie is where the purpose lies. The movie is about the simplicities of life and the human emotions that come with it. If you think about it there is an extended metaphor within the movie. These people are almost governed by the creatures of the woods. Because of these creatures, boundries are set, limitations to their way of life are set, and there is the constant fear of death if someone were to break these set ways. Coming back to human nature, Shyamalan really only explores two human emotions; life and love. There is also the mild exploration of fear and death, and how by fearing death it forces us to enjoy life and love, but I'm getting way too into it here. The only downside of the movie is actually the ending, but it's funny because the ending is also the key to the movie. But how can the movie be good if the ending is bad? Simply put, the ending works. It really does. The thing about the ending is that the ending itself lowers the credibility of the movie by being a little too absurd. You can expect the Shyamalan Formula here, he'll throw all the answers at you first and then present you with the questions and then hit you with the final thing that makes it work. This is where people start becoming dissapointed because its not something huge like The Sixth Sense or Signs, but something subtle and meaningful in a real way, not fictional.<br /><br />ACTING: There are no aging action stars in this movie, but there are some veteran actors and a newcomer who all pull it off quite nicely. The big names here are William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Joaquin Pheonix. Adrien Brody has his 2nd major role since The Pianist playing a mentally challenged resident of the village. The fresh new face here is Academy Award Winner Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard. She makes a very smooth transition into the acting world and you'd think that she's been acting for a while when this is her first major role. There really is no main character here and you feel that, no one actor has a noticeably large amount of screen time and that works. Mel and Bruce were the stars of the previous entries in Shyamalan's filmography, but even with the big names everyone is treated equally here. This will make more sense once you see the ending.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: People expecting another thriller will be dissapointed, instead try a new flavor. Enjoy this meaningful poetic film for what its really meant for, not for suspense or scares but for exploring the one thing that confuses us the most. . . ourselves.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	Yuck. Kristen Stewart prettier than Charlize??? Please! Not even a good story. Don't waste your time or money. Disney is better than this.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	This was a great movie,Charlize Theron as the witch stepmother was just down right frighting. She deserves every award she wins for her acting skills, I fear for anyone with a stepmother like her. I hate the way the movie ended though, maybe they left it wide open like that to make room for the sequel. From the rumors they are not going to use Kristen Stewart, that would be a shame because I would like to see the battle between the Huntsman and William for Snow's heart.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is a genius. I couldn't stop laughing. If you haven't bought the DVD yet, i strongly recomment that you buy it now.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	As far as I know, M. Night Shyamalan's lateset film 'The Village' has gathered as much (deserved) complaints as the cash from the unsuspected audiences -- with the boxoffice tickets exceeding $100 m. -- and I am one of those who were not impressed with his trademark 'surprise.'<br /><br />As this 'surprise' in case is the part which vastly disappointed us, it is hard to explain why this is a huge letdown.  I only say this; you will surely be 'surprised' at the ending, but probably not in the pleasant way when you see a first-rate magicians.  The truth is, the surprise is made for the sake of 'surprise' only, nothing else.<br /><br />Well, the film starts with a very somber tone.  So somber that you easily accept the apparently contrived situations.  That is like, you see people in 'The Village,' perhaps New England or somewhere like that, and the time is unspecified but looks like 100 years ago.  No detailed explanations are given at first except their peculiar lifestyle.  For example;<br /><br />They live very quietly, observing the religious ceremony;<br /><br />They prohibit the color red (which brings something bad, they think);<br /><br />and they are very afraid of the woods nearby.  But why?<br /><br />As you see, the secrets would be all revealed.  One blind girl Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Haward's daughter) is the key to the revelation, who falls in love with a laconic man Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix).<br /><br />Now, to be fair, the director has not lost the power to create the spooky feelings, greatly helped by the camera of Roger Deakins (famous for Coen Brothers' films).  I found the acting is all so-so, including Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, Michael Pitt, and Adrien Brody.  But to be frank, I thought Ms. Howard needs more training.  Ivy is supposed to be blind but she doesn't look like that -- she is clearly seeing things, and that is not as the blind people do.<br /><br />There are so many hints, or signatures, which suggest something sinister, and something creey, all over the film, and they are pretty interesting until the end of the film.  And  everything loses its credible power when you see the truths, which are too impossible and laughable too.  See it, and check it, but that's after you rent it.
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	So, this series is a blend of lots of R rated sex scenes along with lots of blood sucking and other scenes of violence.  As the season progressed, the acting improved and there were some welcomed surprises! The characters are developed nicely and as aforementioned, as they calmed down and relaxed as actors, they improved and it became a much more fluid and interesting story.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	"Let me be straights, I liked ""pulp fiction"" it had a story to it.<br /><br />But, Sin City was nothing but gratuitous violence, bodies cut up, people tortured for no reason other than psychos wanted to. Beautiful sexy women turned on by blood and gore.  Sex, rape, murder, torture, cannibalism all glorified like these are the best ideas a person can have to make their life more meaningful.<br /><br />It should have been rated X, and the commercial should let you know how much nudity, blood, gore, sex, and violence is in the movie, instead of showing it as if it were artsy and clever.<br /><br />There is no story, or very little story. If it weren't for the constant violence the movie would be nothing but black and white boring depressive scenes. You feel no sympathy for any of the main characters through they certainly tried to make you feel sorry for them by beating them half to death."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I HAD to get this movie to complete my harry potter collection. I had all except the deathly hallows parts 1 and 2. So I made sure I bought part 1 and got part 2 for christmas. Amazon priced it perfect because it was cheaper than walmart!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"I was wary of this movie because of the ""all-star cast,"" which too often in movies means that egos clash and you're left with a half-made film that still makes money because of the names involved.  However, my fears were swept aside within the first ten minutes, which indicates that this is a new take on the classic gangster films in the vein of The Godfather, and by the end, I was convinced that this film is destined to become a classic.<br />The dialogue is a lot like the violence - visceral and unforgiving without getting in the way of the central plot or themes.  The acting is simply superb, and every member of the cast deserves recognition.  The pacing is near perfect, and there are several twists at the end.  Again, though, this movie does not revolve around its twist, unlike other recent films, and it's amazingly re-watchable even when you know what's coming.<br />I gave this movie five stars because you get exactly what you pay for - a gritty crime drama that uncovers new territory for its genre while still delivering a solid film."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I dont know what half of you are looking at but from my Mitsubishi 3D 1080p 65 inch HDTV and the mitsubishi 3D starter kit this 3D movie was INCREDABLE... Everything in the Movie was 3D this looked just as good if not BETTER than Cristmas Carol
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	I tried hard to watch this, but I kept falling asleep.  The movie is dark in its filming, but not in its characters.  So the filming puts you into a mood the characters and action does not really support.  And speaking of action, this moving is terribly lacking.  The previous potter movies were action packed with all sorts of jokes and interactions.  This movie has some action, then it goes on some long drawn out hiatus.  The characters blink onto some deserted island or forest, and its totally barren.  And they sit there and look at each other for like 5 minutes.  I just can't get into it.  Seems like this is how they stretched two movies out of this.  By putting in all this dead time.<br /><br />Then the tension between the 3 main characters seems forced and strained.  Its unnatural, based on the previous films.  Even if there is some underlying magical reason for it, it does not come across right.  Even the story.  The way this begins with characters that are not really bad, being in league with bad characters is awkward.  The whole story is not a natural evolution from the previous ones, its totally out of left field.<br /><br />I gave it 2 stars because it actually has a plot in there.  It had acceptable acting, and good sets.<br /><br />I might have enjoyed it if I did not expect so much from it.  That expectation did not hurt my view on the previous entries in the series.  This one just fails.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Let me start by saying I'm a 22 year female that just had 2 babies within a year that does a lot 2 a girls body.<br />I started working out but didn't see the results i wanted so i got this and have lost over 50lb. Its<br />No joke its freaking hard like the hardest work out i have ever done in my life<br />But it pays off i feel like I'm in the best shape of my life on day 1 i couldn't even do<br />The worm up with out taking a break its no joke but shawnT is awesome and a great trainer if your<br />Looking to lose weight and will actual stick with it i would say this is the best DVD out
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	I was very happy it took alittle longer to get then everything else ive ordered but that was my fault i didnt notice it was coming from califoria so always look to see where its coming from
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This movie is an absolute blast! I haven't read any of the graphic novels but this movie has made me want to. Beware, as it isn't for the faint of heart, as it contains strong violence but great humor like in Kill Bill. The movie is divided into 3 parts. The first one is concluded at the end. I don't want to give anything away but Bruce Willis plays a cop with a heart problem hunting a pedophile; Mickey Rourke is a BEAST ( he's huge) framed for murder; Clive Owen hunts down crooked cops and tries to save prostitutes from extermination. It's a must see and is original as it is in balck and white with color only appearing at certain moments. Reccomended for anyone that wants to watch a movie that's just absolutely AWESOME!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	It's amazing how these types of movies/documentaries/investigative films are being produced.  When are we really going to act on it?  I can say that this affects me and makes me want to be a vegetarian (maybe vegan).  We can rally together for an American Idol contestant, but not for our Government to take a stand against these companies.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This TV production was amazingly accurate and well done.  Paul Giamatti's performance was absolutely flawless.  I watched the entire movie twice in three days!  All the actors and actresses were chosen perfectly for their parts.  The rhetoric between Mr. & Mrs. Adams was great.  She really was the amazing woman that was his helpmate.  I give this selection the highest rating, and plan on viewing it over and over again.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	We love Pixar animation in general, and are particularly fans of Cars. Our 3 year old son would watch it on a continuous loop if allowed.<br /><br />The story is sweet and addresses loyalty, friendship (making and keeping), team work, and respect for the more experienced.<br /><br />The music is great, there is as always funny adult things that make it entertaining.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I was dumbfounded by this movie. The black and white film with the splashes of color mixed in was fantastic. The movie was very reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"" in the way that it begins with the end (sort of) and skips around, finally bringing everything together at the end. There are also scenes that will definitely bring to mind ""Kill Bill"". If the movie itself doesn't grab you, the way in which it was filmed WILL. This has fast become one of my all-time favorite movies, destined, I'm sure, to become a cult classic. I absolutely recommend it!"
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	One of the greatest things about living in the digital age, is the MOVIES THAT CAN BE MADE! This tried and true Stan Winston comic character comes alive in a very relevant, fun and exciting adventure. From the first minute to the last, you are engaged in the story. If you think this is just for kids, think again... Everybody... and I mean everybody will love this film and like my family, wont be able to wait until the second installment. It does not disappoint.<br />Metaldiva Sez: This is a movie you will watch over and over again.  A must have for all ages. Get this home..<br />ON A PERSONAL NOTE: Thank you Robert Downey Jr. for staying with us.  As a fan from way, way back I knew that you were a gifted actor and great human being and looked forward to the great things that I felt would come from you down the road. I was heartsick when you were going through so much for so long, as were your fans and friends all over the world.. I thought we were going to lose you.. Thankfully, you stayed, strayed and finally stayed for good.. and just as I expected, great things have been done, one after the other and the other. Thank you for staying alive..M
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	This review is based on the Amazon Instant Video HD version (I mention this because you don't get the extra material at the end in the Standard Def. version) I can't believe all the people that said they are big fans of the Alien movies that said this movie has nothing to do with that series. The Aliens in this movie are the same aliens that were found in the first movie. I'm referring to the dead alien found in the pilots chair inside the alien space ship. They don't look the same because the alien in the first movie was wearing a space suit. The same space suit that is seen at the first encounter with the aliens in this movie. To make this more clear, in this movie  there are 2 alien life forms in the movie. A human like alien and a monster like octopus alien that starts out like a worm. This movie takes place before the first Alien movie. Another misconception is the one where the humans had touched the alien goo, and how dumb that was. Watch the movie again but more closely this time. It's the android that does all the touching of the alien substances . I didn't see this movie in the theater because of all the criticisms. And I have to admit that the previews made the movie look dumb. But after I saw it I thought it was mostly misunderstood. But I had the advantage of reading the reviews and I was looking for what was said regarding the dumb things that were reported. As my title says, after the credits there are scenes that were cut out and should not have been that show a more recognizable alien bursting through the chest of the human like alien. As stated in the first Alien movie, these creatures take on DNA from their host that changes their appearance. So what you see in this movie as far as the octopus like creature becomes the aliens that were in all the other movies. I've got enough spoilers in my review and I'm sorry for that but I thought there was to much confusion (and intentional misdirection from Dir. Scott) to just review the movie. There have been a number of poorly made Alien Vs Predator movies recently and that's probably why Mr Scott said that this wasn't another Alien movie like the previous ones.<br /> So do I recommend this movie? Well if you know the difference between interesting SIFI and Horror SIFI, then I would say it's good interesting SIFI. But if your looking for a movie more like Aliens where the monster aliens eat everybody, or turn them into incubator's hanging from slim covered walls, and lots of machine gun action and space marines then your out of luck. Mr Scott has made a movie that's more like there were no other sequels to Alien until this one. I would suggest anyone that wants to make more sents of this movie watch the first one again, then this one and rather then paying close attention to the action, and all the other visual attractions, listen to and remember what's being said. you'll find there some interesting connections.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	The movie was received exactly as described. The case is well preserved and the DVD runs beautifully.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	When i heard that Martin was going to make this movie I couldnt wait for it to be released.  I went in the theater with high hopes a was not dissapointed. Dicaprio and Damon both put out kickass performances and you cant for get Jack is back. Best movie of 06 and deserves oscar for best picture and actors.
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	this is one of the best.  seen him live and I couldn't wait to get this DVD. Well worth the money.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	We have this movie, but I purchased this one for my Grandson who is 2 1/2.  One of the few movies he will actually sit and watch.  He loves cars and trucks right now.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This man is truly talented - if this don't make you larf, then consider watching CNN
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I had seen many of Jeff's appearances on TV specials in the past, so I bought both of his DVDs. I wasn't disappointed. I laughed my butt off! If I was a thin-skinned person, I might take offense at some of his jokes, puppet characters, and some of the adult language. But I have heard language like that coming from the mouths of young children! The DVD has a ""bleeped"" version, but for me, the humor suffers with this editing. This is adult humor, so don't play it around the kiddies if that is a concern for you. As I write this, there are 608 four and five star reviews, and 15 ""pans"". You do the math."
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"Robert Downey Jr. makes the movie for sure - he plays his character to a ""T"".  There is a reasonable amount of Iron Man action, but much of the movie seems to be setting up the sequel.  I agree with one reviewer's comments regarding the not-so-subtle political message in the film that powerful people in the business of making weapons delight in conflict and will create conflict if none exist to maximize their profits and power (""evil war mongering capitalists"" versus patriots with a desire for freedom to triumph over tyranny).  Contrasted with Batman, The Dark Knight, in my opinion a better (albeit disturbing) movie - the notion of inherent evil is recognized as a force to be battled with unyielding courage, strength, and ingenuity.<br /><br />Tony Stark is confronted with the fact that that up close - war is a dirty business and when advanced weapons fall into the hands of ruthless people with a lust to control others - harm will come to innocents.  In his subsequent conversion to a less capitalistic humanitarian - eschewing the advancement of weapons to wage war and the profits that follow - he manages in a twist of irony to invent a weapon more deadly then anything he's ever created.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good film - good cinematography, special effect, action, acting, and story.  On the down-side: as a family movie, I would have preferred that the gratuitous sex scene was implied vs. demonstrated (I realize it was relevant to develop Tony's character);  a fairly large portion of the action was Tony perfecting his suit vs. battling villains; and, I would have preferred a less trite portrayal of the defense industry and scientists.<br /><br />Hopefully, the sequel will get down to the business of heroic action battling evil."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	No messing around here.  I thought I was in decent shape, but this really pushes you.  Love love love it!<br /><br />The only thing: if you live in an apartment without a sturdy/ solid floor, there's major potential to irritate anyone living below you.  If you can't do a tuck jump and land without the floor rattling (and then do it again about 80 times), you might want to consider how often you'll be able to get your workout in without disturbing anyone.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	Just because it is a holiday, should we teach kids it is temporarily okay to go out in the middle of the night, not dressed for the weather, leaving their homes to be with perfect strangers?  I rate this movie not worth buying or renting.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	You can not even blame Harrison Ford's age for this disaster. The blame lies directly with Spielberg and Lucas for this pathetic attempt. From the flying fridge to the monkey rescue, this movie is worse than the last installment of The Mummy series. Poor effects and horrible script. I saw it opening weekend and twenty minutes into it I was looking at my watch and counting the minutes.<br /><br />However, I do hope they release another one because the current pattern dictates that the next one should be a classic. Raiders was, Temple of Doom was painful, Last Crusade was fantastic, and Crystal Skull was trash. If the pattern continues, the next one should be worth checking out.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	THIS IS THE SECOND DVD OF JEFF DUNHAM THAT I HAVE AND I MUST TELL EVERYONE THAT THIS MAN IS A GENIUS!!!!  NOT ONLY ARE HIS PUPPETS INTRIGING, BUT THE COMEDY ROUTINES THAT ACCOMPANY THEM IS HYSTERICAL!!!!  I HAVE KNOWN ABOUT HIM SINCE HIS EARLIER TIMES WITH PEANUTS, AND WALTER.  I JUST WISH THAT I COULD PROCURE DVD'S OF HIS EARLIER PERFORMANCES.  HIS WIT AND CHARM ARE OUTSTANDING, AND HE IS THE BEST WHEN IT COMES TO HIS ART!!! WE MUST CHEER HIM ON AND HOPE THAT HE MAKES DVD'S OF ALL HIS PERFORMANCES!!!!
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	"This was not a good movie.  I waited and waited for it to improve, never happened.  Some of the visual effects are cool, but even that gets redundant.  Theron does the best she can with what she was given.  Hot Huntsman, so a little eye candy for the ladies.  And Stewart, oh that poor girl.  I have seen her in other movies (not Twilight) where her style is appropriate for the role.  Think ""Into The Wild"" or ""Adventure Land"".  It looks like her Twilight success has pushed her into a role that is beyond her abilities.  I do not recommend."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I love this DVD.  I don't think it was as good as his first one but DEFINITELY worth having.
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	"This movie had some great special effects and I still love the gang from Hogwarts, but it was also very disappointing.  The story was shortened so badly that elements that should have been emphasized got lost in translation.  If you read the book you could probably follow along, but I feel sorry for those people who just wanted to see the movie.  Too many things weren't explained.<br /><br />The dreams that Harry had about the ministry of magic were a key element in the story, yet they were barely shown in the film.  The attack on Mr Weasley and the ""hunt"" for the prophecy were much too vague in the movie, yet the prophecy and Voldemort's desire for it was the key point of the story.<br /><br />At Hogwarts, the appointment of Dolores Umbridge as the High Inquisitor, and later as the replacecment for Dumbledore, was also a key story line.  She banned groups of three or more students from meeting, which is why they needed a secret place to train together.  She didn't want them to learn defense, so she taught them the book.  She passed one decree after another making life miserable for the stundents, yet that was relegated to simply showing Filch hanging one frame after the other.<br /><br />This movie had very little impact on the understanding of the continuing story of Harry, Hermione and Ron.  The important of the OWLS for the students was downplayed, as was the intense scrutiny of the teachers by Umbridge and her dismissal of Trelawny.  Let's don't forget about the departure of the Weasley twins.  In the film it wasn't much more than a quick fireworks scene and them flying away...not the impact that their leaving should have had.<br /><br />And where the heck was the Order of the Phoenix in all this???  There were very few hints at the Order throughout the film...kinda of defeats the purpose of the title.<br /><br />All in all, I wasn't very satisfied at the end of the film.  I really think they could have added 30 minutes and done more justice to the story."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	The movie was sent and worked just fine, still waiting for p/t 2 to come on pre order cant wait
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Makes you feel like you know what life was actually like back then.  Very interesting.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I just got to watch this on DVD and it is amazing! I can't wait to see part 2. I have read the full series and thrilled with how the movies have turned out.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	The Movie arrived in record time and is even better then was described! This is only my second purchase through Amazon.com and I couldn't be more pleased.<br /><br />Thank you for excellent service I'll be back
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, amazed at the concepts behind the making of the suit, special effects made it realisticlly possible. Humor was dry and witty. Interesting ending.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"I'm sick of everybody saying that this is a Tarantino film.  Granted, he did do a guest director job.  But c'mon, DON'T forget about Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller(the one responsible for the ENTIRE realm of Sin City).  Anyways, i'm sure you all know that this film is a visual masterpiece.  It's like they took the art off the comic book pages and turned them into real life, it's just rediculous how awesome it looks.  so yeah, see it, make others see it.<br /><br />one more thing..it's also annoying when people bash on the narration and ""cheesy lines"".  Check out a sample of the comic book and you will see that it is necessary and very well done.<br /><br />enjoy."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I thought that the filmmakers did an excellent job.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. brings the perfect performance for Tony Stark making him believably both conceited and compassionate (though usually not at the same time). He makes the hero a very human character.<br /><br />Both the ending and the beginning come across slightly shaky in their storytelling aspects, but the middle of the movie more than makes up for it. The action is well shot and there is a good pacing. It's interesting to see the evolution of the Iron Man suit from the very utilitarian origins to the more finessed version that emerges in the end.<br /><br />The special effects are very well done, merging practical effect work and physical suit shooting with CG very seamlessly. You never find yourself being distracted by an obviously inserted special effect plate or having to force yourself to overlook certain aspects of the visual that don't quite blend well enough.<br /><br />And it was definitely refreshingly different to see Jeff Bridges play the heavy. He does it very well.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I have had a copy of Polar Express from Amazon, last year, and my mom loved it, so I gave her my copy, and then got another one.  Now a friend of mine who has a 12 year old daughter loved it too, so I just purchased her a copy for a Christmas present.  It is a wonderful<br />Computerized fantasy, and one of my favorite scenes is when the waiter's come dancing into the club car, serving hot chocolate to the children on board.  You will enjoy watching it over again.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	a movie than stands out and should be at a 5star standing its a good movie plain and simple go out and get this one today its enjoyable!!!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is probably the best Christian movie I have seen. I first saw it at the theater, which my daughter recommended. I bought the DVD as soon as it was released, watched it, gave it away to a family member, and bought the second DVD.<br /><br />The movie is very touching--it even made my husband cry, which is rare. It makes both husband and wife think about their responibility to each other and why they fell in love in the first place.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This DVD's special features are non-existent, much like the first release of Kill Bill.<br /><br />This is not a comic book turned into a movie, it's a movie turned into a comic book! Frank Miller's gritty tale of Sin City is summed up for us in this masterpiece with excellent visual effects, damn sexy women, and some of some hard-as-nails men narrating the stories. Even if the story was crap, it's visually stunning. Turns out though, it's fantastic.<br /><br />Recommended if you like Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, etc.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	There has been a lot of negative remarks about Kristen Stewart in this movie. I don't think she was all that bad. I am sure there are other actresses who could have given a stronger perforamnce but the way this script was writtten, in my opinion, the story line was not about Snow White it was about the effects on the people after the Queen came to power, Snow White was a by product of those effects. Kristen may not have added anything extrodinary to the film but she really didn't detract from it either. Charlize was magnificent as always, and the special effects were awsome, and Chris well he is just a cutie!! Over all a pretty good movie.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This was a great gift for my three yr old grandson. Loved the fact that we have DVD and Blue ray to play now. Best price also!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	My review may be a little biased as I love all things Harry Potter, but this movie was GREAT! I laughed, I cried, then I laughed and cried more. Great job at keeping to the story and the actors are super comfortable with their characters, but after 7 films they should be.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	"Are you an Indy fan? Then avoid this movie! I love the original 3 films, this last one was disgraceful! Raiders of the Lost Ark dealt with the Ark of the Covenant, heavily based in magic and myth. Temple of Doom (originally the weakest of the 1st 3 films) dealt with the Thuggee cult also based heavily in magic and Hindu myth. The Last Crusade dealt with the Holy Grail, you bet, heavily based in magic and myth. The Crystal Skull...aliens?!?! Come on! I admit, the film gave the series an ending, but Shia LaBeouf's character was hollow and totally unbelievable. Indy was named after the dog, so Shia's name is ""Mutt"". There were a number of scenes with Indy and Mutt that was reminiscent of Indy and his dad from ""Crusade"", but it wasn't enough to make it a good film. Once again George Lucas took his classic and ruined it (i.e. Episodes I,II and III)"
B00447G29S	1.0	b	In this ever-changing high tech world, I have fallen prey to ignorance. We had just purchased an HD plasma TV and could not wait to view this wonderful movie in HD. What no one told us was the DVD player had to be HD also. And the battle between HD and Blu-ray dvd is not over -who knows which will win??? Meanwhile, we own a dvd we can not view!
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	This film was a huge disappointment.  Flat characters with no development; a plot that was so predictable I was almost able to say the lines of the characters as they were talking!  There were several inconsistencies throughout the film (i.e., scares appear then disappear).  The religious overtones were also over the top.  All in all the film was a big disappointment and a let down.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Excellent movie that should open up the consumers' eyes. My personal experiences at stock barns, farms, food factories, grocery stores, restaurants, etc., was realistic and many times a horror, but this movie shows us what our country has come to and what the average consumer isn't aware of, is complacent to, or just plain apathetic about.<br /><br />It shows us who's running the country in regard to what we are dependent on... FOOD. It should kick the mentality of intelligent people into not buying into the propaganda we are fed, and becoming less dependent on the buying that we now experience. Peoples' lives are apparently not as precious as the almighty dollar. Our government is also slacking off by letting this go on by not putting more people with integrity into the jobs associated with our food consumption system. Animals as well as humans are being degraded and treated less than inhumane. Putting thought back into how we live now as compared to 50 years ago, may rattle some cages and the truth may get them to show some real patriotism and caring about others in this country.<br /><br />I think that watching this movie would be educating as well as motivating to any human being who watches it! Diseases and health issues are rampant and this movie gives us a glimpse into that. What I really admire, is that this isn't a PETA documentary, but written by an omnivore just like me.<br /><br />I thank Bill and Louise Daniels of WellSpring Lifestyle Retreat in Goodspring, TN for recommending this movie to me.<br /><br />Carpe diem, ya'll! Make a difference, even if it's a small one.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.  I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.  If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Okay, so I must confess I am not a comic book afficionado so I was blissfully unaware of the Iron Man comic series, but I don't think you need to know the comic strip to enjoy this movie immensely, because I did.<br /><br />I love the quirkiness that Robert Downey, Jr. brought to the character and that he's more than just a spoiled genius with unlimited financial resources, he's got a conscience and he's determined to do right in the world.<br /><br />The special effects are great but they don't overpower the storyline, which is a wonderful change of pace because the story can hold its own, even without all of the special Iron Man CGI stuff.<br /><br />The interplay between the two main characters, Trask and Rhodes, is believable and you see how much both men care for and respect each other.<br /><br />The character of Pepper is tedious and a bit whiney, but that might simply be what Ms. Paltrow bring to the part.<br /><br />This movie was a refreshing and very pleasant surprise, which makes me want to see how the sequel is handled...  In fact, I think I'll put it in the DVD player right now and see how well they did!<br /><br />It was a surprise to find a really great, entertaining movie and not feel like I had to endure the heaps and gobs of special effects to get back to the actual story.  I cannot recommend this movie enough for the sheer enjoyment of being entertained without being patronized or bombarded with loud explosions and foul language.<br /><br />This is a true gem of a movie.
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	As always Jeff Dunham is very entertaining. I was very pleased with the content of this video. I would recommend this purchase to anyone.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I ordered 7 copies of Cars for Christmas presents.  They came in quickly, and in perfect condition.<br /><br />Thanks.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	I looked forward to seeing this movie for months, however I was disappointed in the end.  For the most part, this was an excellent movie, the cinematography was fantastic, the story was great, the supporting actors were fabulous (Charlize Theron as the Queen was just perfect).<br /><br />However the leading role was very poorly played.  The actress showed virtually no emotive skills.  I just could not sympathize or identify with Snow White, because the role was played so incredibly poorly.<br /><br />It's a shame.  This could have been a great movie.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	A very interesting adaptation of the Disney told story of years ago!  Excellent special effects, actors were very good in their rolls, I'd watch it again!<br />Blu-Ray & DVD arrived on time as ordered, price was fair.  I did not know much of this production prior to actually seeing the story unfold, it held my attention.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This DVD set is fantastic.  The workouts are difficult, but they are *not* for folks who cannot perform high-impact exercise.  I am most impressed with the format.  Shaun T comes across as very genuine and motivates you without patronizing you.  A lot of other DVD fitness instructors seem like people who are insecure because they couldn't get a date in high school, but Shaun checks his baggage at the gym door and encourages you to motivate yourself.  The other people in the video are fit and attractive, but they come across as real people.  No matchy-matchy outfits and 'fitness models' with implants, here.  Everyone in the video is moving at their own pace, and pushing themselves.  The clock at the bottom of the screen helps you keep going.  This would be a great program for people who travel, since you don't need any equipment.  My preschooler loves to do the videos with me.  She likes to try all the running in place and jumping, so this has been a fun way for me to model healthy behaviors for her, as well.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	Mirror...Mirror starring Julia Roberts was a much better movie.  Neither the Huntsman nor Snow were fully developed characters and didn't deserve their status on the marquee.  An imprisoned Snow White doesn't emerge as a warrior heroine but as a girl lost to her circumstances.  And who is the huntsman...an actor stuffed in a role for his looks because he cannot be the love interest of Snow White? This movie suffered from a case of reaching for too much while giving too little.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	It is a very cocky from Jeff Dunham to realease HD Discs of his shows, but it's worth it.<br /><br />He is handsome, funny and great ventriloquist.<br /><br />His puppets: Peanut, Walter and Jos&eacute; Jalape&ntilde;o are crazy, but Achmed makes you laugh till you cry.<br /><br />I just love this show.<br /><br />Enjoy it !
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"During the early portions of this film, some time is taken to try to express the idea that Intelligent Design is a science, not a religion, that it has nothing to do with ""God.""  By the end of the film, however, this is completely shown to be false as it is God that becomes the focus of the discussion.  The final interview with Richard Dawkins, for example, is for the most part just Stein asking if Dawkins believes in various gods (Do you believe in the Hebrew god?  The Trinity, the New Testament god?  The Hindu gods? And so on and so forth).  As Dawkins says during the interview, these questions are ridiculous considering the fact that Dawkins is probably the most high profile and vocal atheists in the world, and throughout the interview he repeatedly stated he believed in no god, that he found the idea that a god might exist to be highly unlikely.<br /><br />But all of that skirts the issue... why would a documentary supposedly about science make its climax a stupid and pointless conversation about whether or not a single person believes in God or not? It completely and utterly destroys whatever arguments he was trying to make, without even going into the weakness of these arguments to begin with.  This film is propaganda and poorly executed propaganda at that."
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	this movie was really cool.its not just about a few cars going left a lot in circles.first,theres a 3 way tie at the winston cup[nascars world series].this never happened before although kurt busch did finish 1st and jimmie johnson was 8 points behind 2 years ago.theres a lot of nasbar related stuff in there.1-only like 2 actual #s ftom a real nextel cup car are used.2-one of the cars on a 3 way tie is called the king.thays richard pettys old nickname.and the car was a old dodge superbird like the one ol king used to drive once.then theres a green and white car thats really aggressive.thats obviously dale earnhardt with a different paint job.then theres lightning mcqueen.hes the cool break out rookie who gas a chance to break a record by being the 1st rookie to be champ.anyhow,those 3 must race in a 3 car only race off at the end of the movie.any nascar fan i think will really enjoy it.it isnt just tossed together.someone actualy took time to research racesars.there the bump and run ,drafting,the skingshot and also as an asses bonus the racecars do famous things from nascar history like the pass in the grass and winning a race backwards.i think in all movies for children only toy story 1 and 2 are better.there are 2 poinrs i didnt like.1-mcqueen isnt a very cool name for a manly racecar hotshot rookie.unless of course you mean lightning is like jeff gordon then it all makes sense.2-the other thing i didnt like was the outcome of the big race  at the end.of course i cant say who won but they were booed and  had stuff thrown at them.thats just not a good thing to teach kids eveb if they font know that car was patterned after the greatest racecar driver ever.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Great movie-it opened my eyes to some of the deplorable practices of the food industry.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Excellent Christmas movie. The entire family enjoyed watching it, especially the children. Our 3 year old niece wanted to watch it over and over. The animation is first rate. We could watch this any time of the year.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I absolutely love this movie. It was wonderful! It is so creative and interesting. I can't wait for a movie marathon watching all the HP movies with my fiance!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	If you've ever read the comics, you would know that this movie is frame-for-frame, line-for-line (almost) accurate. There has never been a movie adaptation this close to a comic book before, and that's a good thing.<br /><br />I saw the movie first, then bought the graphic novels, and now I'm in love with Sin City. Do yourself a favor and pick up the Sin City Graphic Novel Library. Amazon sells it for $125. It's worth every penny.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	One of the most influential movies I have seen. I have decided not to eat meat or chicken because of this movie. I owe it to myself, the animals and the planet!If everyone would watch this movie maybe we have a chance of fighting the corporations who are destroying the farming industry. It's time to speak up and support our local organic farmers and the companies who buy from them. Anyone with children should watch this movie!
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	I guess it's my own fault for not really looking into this movie before I saw it.  I thought this was going to be a little heart warming indie.  Much to my surprise, it was nothing but a proselytizing tool.  A bad one at that.  Come to Christ, and everything is gonna be alright.  Turn your back on him, and you'll become addicted to pornography.  Tell that to all the Christians in their second and third marriages.  Let's forget for a moment that this just a bad attempt at converting people.  Let's talk about the non bash you over the head with a sappy message moments.<br />Cameron's performance isn't horrible.  He actually has a few moments in the film where you might buy him as a human being.  That can't be said for the rest of the cast.  Listening to some of the lines delivered, was almost unbearable.  This would be hard pressed to make it as a Lifetime movie of the week.  I can only assume that most of these actors were pulled out of the local community.  So it isn't there fault.  It's the producers.  At no point during the film did I connect with, or care about any one in the film.  If only I was addicted  to porn.<br />The comedy beats, or the attempted comedy beats, all fall flat.  The two action sequences are about the only thing that made me laugh.  No sense of peril at all.  I realize they probably were working on a ridiculously low shoe string budget, but that's no excuse  You don't large scale effects, or set pieces to create nail biting suspense.  You do however need good writing.  Good direction, Good editing, and good acting.  This one missed on all counts.<br />What I don't get about this movie is what they are attempting to do with it.  I know they are trying to witness to people through the screen, but the only people it's going to connect with, are the people that have already sipped the Cool Aid. So, really.  What's the point.  If you're a non Christian, this movie is laughable in the points it tries to convey.  If you're a Christian, you would be much better off seeing one of your congregations stage plays, about the dangers of pornography, abortion, atheism, secularism, humanism, evolution, other religions, rock music, or the gays.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	An excellent series; well acted and thoughtfully written.  If you hated history growing up this series will change your outlook on it.  Costuming and make-up also outstanding.  All around a valuable purchase.
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	Scott if u wanted to do a remake of the Alien franchise please just do that next time..this movie was a boring,dull and lifeless failed attempt..ughhh highly dissappointed in this film
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Great product, Beachbody delivers what they promise.  I'm only a couple of weeks into it but I feel 100% better.  Shaun T is a very good motivator.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Ok so the movie itself was good and everyone in this movie was good except for Kristan Stewart for some reason I don't know if its just me but she only has one facial expression and its the one that looks like she's always in excruciating pain she is a horrible actress and anyone who hires here is stupid she only has one facial expression really come on!!!!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Hands down, the best movie of 2006.  Director  Martin Scorsese has created a masterpiece. Filming, script and atmosphere are all top notch. The acting of the large ensemble cast is first rate, especially Leonardo DeCaprio who gives the best performance of his career thus far. This 2-disc Special Edition couldn't be better.
B001684L0A	1.0	b	Great movie. The problem was that I ordered the disc set off of Amazon and the first cd was scratched up so bad that the movie never functioned once w/o having skipping & disc issues.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Great for long trips in the car. Works on U.S. PSP's. Be sure to have a car charger for your PSP. You can get the Part 2 also.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"If you like movies that give you a murder a minute, this is your movie. IF you enjoy basic themes where psychopath kills everyone in sight to get a case of money with virtually no other plot substance, than this is for you. If you delight in movie endings that have you saying outloud ""what the hell kind of an ending was that"", this is a good choice for you. If watching blatant brutality gives you an adrenaline rush, than this is a good pick.<br />  If you're a fan of the Coen Brothers as I was, than this movie will seriously disappoint you.<br />  Definately not a chick flick.<br /> Mind-boggling to see so many positive reviews. Makes me wonder about the inherent nature of humanity."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This was probably one of the best mini-series I have ever seen on television.  It's authenticity is beyond compare.  I recently read that they used real horse manure on the streets - ugh - but effective.<br /><br />This film was beautifully done.  Paul Giamatti is absolutely brilliant, Stephen Dillane aka Jefferson is incredible and steals every scene, Tom Wilkinson aka Benjamin Franklin is superb, Laura Linney is fantastic, Danny Jones, David Morse, Rufus Sewell, and Sarah Polly etc. are equally as wonderful.<br /><br />The dialogue is spot on for the time period.  You can feel the hand of David McCollough in this movie.  You can also tell that Tom Hanks was involved.  Tom is known to do justice as a producer to period films (i.e. Band of Brothers and From Earth to the Moon)<br /><br />If there was ever a mini-series in which everyone and everything deserved an award this is it.<br /><br />Note - this is a mini-series for those of us who like historical and period film.  It's starts slow, revs up in the middle, and ends slow but once you start watching you can't stop.  You get really invested in this film.<br /><br />If you are not interested in period movies this is not the movie for you.  It's pretty long --but wonderful!
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I felt compelled to do a review on this movie due to the bad reviews. Give this movie a chance! It kept me interested from start to finish. It was very visually stimulating and Kristen Stewart's acting wasn't bad at all! The movie revolves around good vs. evil. Dark vs. light. There is also some well placed symbolism that you can notice if you're looking for it.  I absolutely LOVED it! Glad I watched this movie even though it didn't have the best reviews. Don't go off the bad reviews here people, you'll miss out if you go by others bitterness. They must be on the evil queen's side ;) lol It was a dark/beautiful story.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Top to bottom this is the standard that all comic book movie will be judged by. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. It is the perfect blend of comedy, and a movie that stays true to the comic. The special effects are great! Jeff Bridges does a great job as the villian and I must say that the bald head looks cool as hell on him. Even Pepper Potts is good. I am not a fan of Paltrow but she is great in this part!<br /><br />GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!
B001684L0A	4.0	b	"Okay; first off, even the first episode relies on a glaring error that likely can be attributed to David McCullough's book, seeing how this film is based on his best-selling biography on John Adams for which he received a Pulitzer Prize for his writing abilities.  Certainly it can be attributed to the culpability of the author or authors of this HBO series--not for its adaptation--for its repeating the same mistake as in McCullough's book if not having researched the premises or facts that McCullough had supposedly checked.<br /><br />Contrary to popular misconceptions--one obviously seconded by McCullough through this film series--the Tea Act of 1773 DID NOT impose new English taxes against the American colonies.  It instead allowed the East India Company to monopolize against Colonial tea companies with low-priced tea through a tax exemption (read: a tax break) which that corporation could turn into profits from the American colonists--take, take, take.  Parliament's interests in the Company would subjugate Americans by leaving the taxes off so that American colonists would rather buy that company's lower-cost Tea, to direct the profits taken from the low-price incentive of not paying taxes into the pockets of a failing British tea company in which English members of parliament and the Crown held stock! We were fighting against aristocracy!  Boston's Tea Party wasn't so much an American rebellion against England as it was a rebellion against inequality in the economic subjugation of the General People by Aristocracy!<br /><br />Taxes themselves are re-investments toward the People.  If England's people weren't going to do something about economic subjugation and inequalities, certainly America's colonies could choose to, which is why this Act is so important to U.S. History.  Sam Adams, John's cousin (the guy who plotted the Boston Tea Party), wasn't against having taxes; he was for representative taxes! Because, importing duty-free merchandise (duty-free means tax-free, i.e. like an impact tax or import tariff) would lower the price beyond that of a fair-market, local pricing.  It's an unfair competition tactic that would put American local money directly into the pockets of an already-wealthy aristocracy--an elite--a select few with notions of protecting their own aristocratic interests in a failing company, and those of no one else. Certainly it would draw funds out of the American people's market.  Such tactics prevent the many who work for success to obtain it, and the few who should fail to not fail, because those few have control of the Law.  It's unfair.  The Patriots knew England's parliament held private interests conflicting with those of the [general] People.<br /><br />I would let this movie's pretense go, but I get sick of people getting it wrong.  The notion that McCullough's book is supposedly so popular as an accurate word on the life of John Adams yet gets this as wrong as everybody else deserves a reflection to any opinion of it.  This is just out of the courtesy to respecting the reality of American idealism--what we hoped to obtain in declaring open revolt against England.  Doesn't McCullough know what we were revolting against?<br /><br />Oddly, McCullough gives ample detail to show how John Adams and America's United States began with a conservative approach because of the country's youth and instability following its revolution, as his doing so doesn't seem particularly conservative in the same way of today's conservative movement.  Real conservatism isn't necessarily bad.  Much of today's ""liberals"" are similarly conservative and less anxious to get involved in a war in the same way John Adams is depicted in this series during France's war with England.  A credit to the progress of the film's story is Adams' transformation from a person who talks all the time to a man who, once the new country begins, talks less and does more thinking, especially in the episode in which he becomes the Second President in succeeding G. Washington who relied on A. Hamilton, though I am unsure to the accuracy of the depiction; however and interestingly, the film is and should be taken from Adams' perspective, so some historical mis-data is arguably acceptable, because we are not accounting for history in any more than the perspective of Adams which, if it paints others in bias, certainly it may be the bias of Adams, because it is HIS biography.  But, that admission doesn't excuse the common mistake painting so deliberate an error as the presumption that the Tea Party was against having to pay tax, or even to pay it to England, when the Tea Party was the opposite.  These authors presume that fact rather than get it from Adams!  It was about going against the corruption of aristocratic greed and this biography is more about his life than that of the country, meaning there is some need to regard reality over the presumption of telling only Adams' story, even when it IS based on HIS biography, despite the poetic story-telling in this well-made series.  All of McCullough's observations of Adams could be written to feel nearly the same and still have gotten the information more accurate in its portrayal of politics at that time, and if it had, there would have been no loss in describing Adams MORE faithfully, in a MORE proper context, within the current mellow-dramatic composition of what was already in this film; it would've been even better if it had gotten that part right!<br /><br />That McCullough is a historical story-teller who gets some of its history wrong, because he doesn't want to bore people by being a historian, means people reading and watching the biography won't question this misinformation while much of the normal misinformation IS corrected.  Why didn't he correct this?  Is the only context in which people remember that the Tea Party supported taxes to be in a strict documentary with a narration and a host like the Biography Show of the Arts and Entertainment Channel or one of P.B.S.?  Certainly this dramatic interpretation follows without noting an important pretense, and for no reason!  There is nothing of more historical importance than that Adams helped birth the U.S. to detach its land's people from the specific corruption of aristocratic greed!  Watching the miniseries, those American lifestyles that McCullough didn't seem to understand was very much for the reason of which he isn't conscious in his depiction of it!  Certainly I doubt that Adams' conservatism merely stopped at the fact that the country was in its infancy still, for nobody in the U.S. in the first twenty years was particularly wealthy like the wealthy of today's corporate environment.  That the country was brittle doesn't go against American themes on equality which is the reason we were in open revolt.  There's no blatant evidence within this film that the youthful brittleness resulted directly from an economic problem, or, if it were, that it wasn't created as part of the equality it sought in revolting; or in anything else--it never explains why Adams thought it was brittle or promotes any descriptive thesis: it just kind-of throws it out there without explanation."
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	"The movie was great, not perfect, but great.  You can read all about it elsewhere.<br /><br />This, meanwhile, is my honest, appalled, and feeling somewhat ripped-off review of the Two Disc ""Special"" Edition DVD.<br /><br />Where's the specialness?!  Where's the features?!  Why am I paying up to 75% more for an extra disc over the normal version!?<br /><br />For the sake of continuity with my other HP movies that come with two discs, and not wanting to be left out on the bonus features, I got the Special Edition.<br /><br />The bonus features are laughably minimal, and barely exceeding an hour in full.<br /><br />Magic of Editing: A very short documentary about the importance of editing in a scene, then a stupid game that lets you add music and sound effects to a scene from the movie.<br /><br />Deleted and Alternate Scenes: The totality of these scenes, minus the first one which seemed just a joke for the die-hard fans, added up to maybe five minutes or less.  Would it really have hurt the movie to include them in the final cut?  Most of the scenes were second-long add-ons to other scenes, such as Neville claiming The Daily Prophet really is full of crap after Seamus confronts Harry in the common room, or Harry passing by Dumbledore's office towards the end, and Dumbledore motioning for him to come in.  That's really it.  The first deleted scene was basically just focusing on the Divinations Professor (sorry, forgot her name) during Umbridge's speech to the students in the Great Hall, basically spilling her food, dropping cream in her water, and all in all making an idiot of herself during the entire 3-4 minute speech.  Clearly they had no intention of including this in the movie, simply because of the sheer ridiculousness and complete irrelevance of it.<br /><br />The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter:  Basically just describing Harry's journey through the first five movies, and ""speculating"" on what's to come, as if the books didn't exist.  The introduction tells us that there are clues all over the movies as to Harry's eventual fate with Voldemort, but the documentary didn't bother dealing too much with this.<br /><br />Trailing Tonks:  Possibly the only really fun part of this bonus.  Natalie Tena (who seems perpetually hopped up on caffeine in this documentary) dressed as Nymphadora Tonks (and occasionally appearing on screen as herself, sans makeup, talking about her experience during this scene or that) guides us around some of the set to show us how various things were done, from sound editing, catering, shooting, prop building, set building, and choreography for wand duels.  She also sings a song on a guitar, with a fabulous voice.  Whole thing lasted like 10 minutes.<br /><br />So basically, this ""special"" edition gives you a few random clips and bits of the movie that add nothing more to the story already missing large pieces according to the book readers, a documentary having little to do with the movie itself, Nat Tena giving us 10 minutes of a fun tour, and a stupid little game not even worth playing.  And they need a whole nother DVD to fit this 1 hour or less of content and package it as if it were the definitive version to own.  Clearly not worth it."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"Tom Hanks dominates this lively, warm, and sweet animated feature, based on the 1985 Caldecott Medal winning book of the same name by Chris  Van Allsburg.<br />  We travel to a home in a snow-filled suburb of Michigan one Christmas Eve, where a young boy on the verge of adolescence lies in bed, hoping to hear the sound of Santa's sleigh bells. His parents (voiced by Tom Hanks and Leslie Zemeckis) check on him and his sister, Sarah (Leslie Zemeckis/Ashly Holloway). But as logic, reasoning, and concrete proof are becoming more essential to the young lad, he has reason to doubt that he will hear the bells; his World Book Encyclopedias tell him the North Pole is a barren wasteland where life cannot be sustained, therefore, no place for Santa to have a toy facory. He has a newspaper story about striking department store Santas, and a copy of Norman Rockwell's painting, ""The Discovery"", featuring a child discovering his father's Santa Claus suit.<br />  Soon enough, there is a mysterious rumbling outside his house. Clad only in his pajamas, robe, and slippers, our Hero Boy wanders out into the snow to investigate. In so doing, he is confronted by an enormous train called The Polar Express, and a conductor urging him to get on.<br />  Reluctantly, he does so, and as a smiling snowman waves in the distance, he is off.<br />  He encounters a group of children in one of the cars, clad only in nightclothes like himself despite the cold. Another little boy(voiced by Peter Scolari) is hesitant to get on, and almost misses the train. Once aboard, he remains by himself in a dark box car.<br /> The Hero Boy becomes better acquainted with his fellow passengers. The most prominent of these are the Know-It-All (voiced by the Eternal Nerd, Eddie Deezen, who is very much in his element), and  the Hero Girl (Nona Gaye), the latter of whom expresses a motherly concern for the Lonely Boy, whose name we learn is Billy.<br />  The children are entertained by the waiters who treat them to an amusing performance while serving hot chocolate.<br /> During the heart of the journey, the children engage in various acts of kindness and civility towards each other, and the Lonely Boy is made to feel more and more included. At one point, a train ticket goes astray and has an interesting journey of its own.<br /> The conductor, Hero Boy and Hero Girl deal with goofy engineers (voiced by the late Michael Jeter, to whom the film is lovingly dedicated), and a dangerous jaunt down an exteremely steep slope.<br />  The Hero Boy has periodic encounters with  a mysterious Hobo(also voiced by Hanks) who confronts him about his lack of faith in Santa, but does help him save a life.<br /> The conductor comes up with an unorthodox way of getting a herd of caribou blocking the train out of the way, and the Hero Boy and Hero Girl view a car filled with damaged toys and are exposed to the concept of recycling.<br />  In the meantime, the Lonely Boy watches the night and begins to sing a wistful carol which becomes more hopeful-sounding when the Hero Girl joins in. Soon, the four main characters are treated to a viewing of the Northern Lights as they approach their destination.<br /> The Christmas City is lively and full of light. The children are surrounded by a multitude of elves, and the three children on whom the story focuses break away from the others after disembarking.<br /> Amid an array of Christmas carols from the 1940s and '50s (in marvelous counterpoint to Alan Silvestri's glorious score), the three observe the inner workings of Santa's toy factory, watching the elves as they monitor the behavior of children all over the world.<br />  Traveling in a tube-like vehicle, as they saw the elves do, they find their way to a conveyer belt where Billy finds a gift with his name and address. But soon the children and  the gift are dumped into the bag on Santa's sleigh. The Know-It-All is found among the packages as well.<br />  To the strains of ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"", sung by a young Frank Sinatra, Santa Claus appears, and the crowd of elves and children go wild with delight.<br />  From his position in the crowd, the Hero Boy cannot see Santa. A bell  falls off of the sleigh's reindeer harness and the Hero Boy picks it up, listening for the jingle and trying to believe with all his might. Of all the children in attendance, Santa selects him to receive the first gift of Christmas before taking off to deliver the gifts.<br /> Watch for a fun cameo by Steve Tyler as an Elf Lieutenant and Elf Singer!<br /> Soon, the children are homeward bound, and the conductor punches a special message of either praise or suggestions for improvement into each of their tickets.<br />  The Hero Boy discovers the harness bell missing, and he is as disappointed about that as Billy was about relinquishing his gift to an elf.<br />  But the magic that both felt had slipped away, is indeed reclaimed on Christmas Day--a theme touched upon the the film's beautiful closing anthem, warmly and soronously sung by Josh Grobin.<br />  While the story focuses on the magic and myths of Christmastime, the Hero Boy and his family are presumably going to attend a church service that day. We learn that as he gets older, the Hero Boy gradually becomes the only one who can hear the sleigh bell.<br /> I wish those on Amazon a fond Christmas 2006, and may we always enjoy the sweetness of the sleigh bells!"
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	This is an enjoyable movie that will put you through a rollercoaster of emotions. Kirk Cameron delivered a good acting performance in this film. Although, I believe many people who are not religious might not FULLY enjoy this movie, as religion is a powerful force that drives this movie throughout; don't get me wrong, you can enjoy this movie if you are not religious, it's just possible that you might not enjoy it to the full extent.<br /><br />There are plenty of posts that explain what his movie is about, so I'm just going to touch on a particular issue I had with it.<br /><br />******SPOILER ALERT BELOW******<br /><br />To tell you the truth, Catherine wasn't worth all the work. The new Caleb deserves better. I understand that she had not touched God yet, but you don't have to touch God to have a heart. I understand that she is upset at him for 7 years of neglect, but her reaction towards his continued acts of kindness would make you think that he beat her like a pinata every night for 7 years. From my observation of their interactions early on, it is clear to me that she is at least 50% of the problem in this marriage. Yet, the whole theme is that he is sorry and the conclusion is that she forgives him. A monster of a husband could have received more warmth by day 20 than he did. Heck, even the father couldn't believe how long it was taking for her to warm up. The guy had his hand on his mouth in disbelief in one scene.<br /><br />Let's put into perspective the type of husband Caleb was the first 7 years: he watched porn and he didn't always listen to his wife; jeez, if real women graded on as high a scale as Catherine, nearly all of us would be out on our behinds!<br /><br />From a religious perspective, I realize that I might be missing the point, but I believe this review is useful for those who are not religious and might have the same line of thinking as me.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Thanks to HBO, I have a much better understanding of the foundation of our country.  Great product for the high school level home schooled student or anyone interested in American history.
B000S5KGH4	2.0	b	This is funny, but it had too much sexual humor. It should be R rated. I would not watch it again or recommend it.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This movie, Oh this movie is so Friggin Awesome. What's it about? What's it about? Its all about being a spectacular film. It has the most originality since Citizen Kane. The color scheme, the direction, the stylized violence, the truly well thought out characters all combines to make this one helluva film. And dare I say it, but maybe the return of sensless nudity? Sin City had a definate Noir influence, and the dialogue is right out of the time when Noir was king. Also the monologue of the characters was very helpful, and lent the movie even more of that comic book feel. The characters were able to tell us, in their own words what was going through their minds.<br />To tell you the truth I was starting to wonder about Rodriguez, after Desperado and Once Upon A Time. But that is all behind us now Robert, if you ask me he has made the best film in the 20 years. Like Kurosawa you have once again risen above the ashes, to bring about a cinematic masterpiece.<br />3 stories from Frank Miller's Sin City were chosen to make their theatrical debut. Though I never read them I did pick up Yellow Bastard and read it at the local book store to see what all the fuss was about. Mickey Rourke as Marv, Bruce Willis as Garrety and Clive Owen as Dwight all do one stellar job in bringing their penciled characters to cinematic life. Though if you ask me Mickey stole the show, he was, as far as I'm concerned Marv.<br />There was a blatant de-masculinization aspect to the film, I mean I can't count the number of times that someone got shot, stabbed, mutilated or hit in the man's bathing suit area. Furthermore this trend or theme was cemented by having prostitutes who run their own part of town (Old Town) without the help of male pimps. But in the end their livleyhood hinges on a man.<br />The only complaint I have is, is that I need to see this one again, my attention was too torn between watching style and the story line.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"People have criticized the random violence and ""empty"" ending of this film.  I am no fan of gratuitous violence or inconclusive messages, so it surprised me that I loved this movie so much.  After reading many reviews and comments on Amazon, I agreed with some of the negative points people made about the film.  But they didn't change my mind.<br /><br />This is because No Country for Old Men succeeds in embodying fear.  Bad-guy Anton is the most frightening figure since Hannibal Lecter.  Why?  Because he is intelligent and on a soul-less mission to kill.  Again: this alone does not make a film good - not by a long shot.  Yet as opposed to other figures in murderous-rampage cinema (take Natural Born Killers, which claims to have a ""message""), this character's made to look plain and ugly, and is no shining beacon of Hollywood that we secretly sympathize with because we know him from other, gentler roles.  At least for the American movie scene, Bardem comes out of nowhere, and that helps make his character alien and unlikeable, and us feel uncomfortable and disturbed in his on-screen presence.<br /><br />Anton and his mission, seen in the context of the film - the dawn of the drug war - brings me back to the character embodying fear.  How many drug-related deaths have we seen in the States in the last decades?  How many innocent people have lost their lives, or survived, by pure (or bad) luck, like the toss of a coin?  Anton embodies (the fear of) this randomness.  It's ugly and scary, it comes and disappears, worst of all never answering the question ""why"".  That, to me, is the crowning achievement of the story. Putting that on the big screen is indeed amazing and is, among other reasons, why I am so floored by the film.<br /><br />If you decide to see No Country for Old Men, don't do it because of the hype about the Coen brothers, the awards, or my commentary.  This film means something different to everyone, and you may say it's just a waste of time.  Or you may end up agreeing with me that it's a masterpiece.  I'll go flip a coin now and see what you decide."
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"The basic premise was good - scientist think they've found our ""creators,"" but also find the creators believe they made a mistake in our creation.<br /><br />But the execution was seriously flawed.  Some action was simply unnecessary and formulaic (like dropping the head and the subsequent rescue from the storm or the deaths of the two explorers who decided to separate themselves from the group - they might as well have been extras on an ""away mission"" in the original Star Trek).  Much was just plain stupid, such as re-animating a 2,000+ year old decapited head with electrical stimulation - this was doubly stupid as it did nothing to advance the plot, just like the storm rescue - David's infection of one of the characters, putting everyone on the Prometheus, including his boss and creator Weyland, at risk (he appeared to rever him), and Shaw's operation, from which she seemed to recover waaaaay too quickly (I thought these Alien creatures were virtually impossible to remove?  Obviously not when you have an autodoc - nod to Larry Niven).  Then there was the simply unbelieveable - like setting down on the planet right where they needed to land, just by coincidence!  (Hint for the next director to tackle such a movie - explain that a probe went into orbit six months before the astronauts' arrival, and a planetary survey was transmitted to them before they got there.)  Common sense left completely when a late scene shows Shaw rappeling out of the creator ship.  Why didn't she just get out the way she went in?  If she did go in that way (the fact that her ATV was awaiting near her point of exit suggests that she did), how did she get up there?<br /><br />The list goes on.  Other commentators here have pointed out several other equally ridiculous plot devices, cliches, and similar problems.<br /><br />It would probably deserve 2 stars, but coming from Ridley Scott with such fanfare and expectation, it falls all the more mightily.  God, I hope he doesn't make a new ""Blade Runner"" movie.  I fear it may be as awful.  ""John Carter"" was actually a better movie (it was fantasy, at least), yet inexplicably, it was panned by the critics while ""Prometheus"" is getting decent reviews.  It was terrible!  Scott has directed a bomb here, and it deserves to tank (although it will probably make a mint)."
B0006989TE	2.0	b	"The Village is a completely frustrating film.  It's shot beautifully, boasts a talented cast of actors, showcases a clearly talented new comer in Bryce Howard, but leaves the viewer with the dreaded, ""Is that it?  Is that all there is?""<br /><br />Scores of armchair film reviewers along with seasoned pros, have criticized, scorned and outright panned the film for it's obvious borrowing from Rod Serling's classic TV show &lt;M. Night, if you NEVER did see that TZ episode, I'd be shocked!> so there's no reason to go over well trod analytical territory.  What I'd like to comment on is the inherent weakness of the character motivations.  After all in a film such as this, everything hinges upon character mindsets and decisions.<br /><br />I should say bizarre and unbelievable character motivations.  Granted, there have been public - and private - cults of people who would make the denizens of The Village look tame - Rev Jim Jones Cult, Korseh in Waco Texas and the Halle Bopp Comet come to mind, however it strains credulity in most every way to believe that so many would give up so much to gain so little.<br /><br />But they had a pristine green valley, sturdily built cute houses and fashions that would make Laura ""Half-pint"" Ingalls Wilder green with envy!  Yes, they did.  They also had no sense of natural progress, no sense of bestowing free choice and entitlement onto their children and of course no sense of reality.  These people were on par with the Truman Show - living a life of illusion while only the elder anointed knew the truth, because it was for the ""better.""  The Village reminded me of just another lavish reality show, except in this case, nobody was voted off, nobody won a prize and nobody was laughing.<br /><br />On the contrary, because of their refusal to keep any type of modern medicinal supplies, tragedy almost happened.  Plot devices like this one are what's so frustrating - there was a thousand reasons why Ivy could have ventured ""beyond the border"" - this one is contrived, convenient and ultimately idiotic.  If only the director had added scenes of regret, or philosophical doubt on the parts of the participants - something.  Instead we get a rushed scene about how ""our life must continue in this fashion.""  If you plan a community that much, if you put that much work and financial resources into it , you don't ever consider medical emergencies?  Yes, it was an experiment in ""utopia"" - things like that SHOULDN'T have happened in such an environment of innocence.<br /><br />And therein lies the irony, for despite a thoroughly pleasing looking movie with great acting, The Village should not have happened either."
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	If there's anyone out there who actually enjoyed watching this flick, I'd be amazed.  What a shame they destroyed the final segment to an awesome franchise with this stinker.  I'd rate it a 3 out of 10.  It's worth it to watch just because it's Indiana Jones, but DON'T buy it; rent it!
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"I bought this movie in BluRay 2 weeks ago. I paid almost $30 for this movie and thought it would be great. What a dissapoinment it was. When it was over, my wife and I both said to each other ""give me back the last 2 hours of my life"" or at least give us our money back! This was a very violent movie (not unexpected) but, the ending left us wondering whether we were cheated because it made no sense! While the acting was reasonable, the ending was the dumbest ending to a movie I have ever witnessed. This was not award winning in any stretch of the imagination. I want a refund!!"
B005ZMUQCK	2.0	b	I purchased this DVD for my husband who is a nascar fan.  When it arrived I sat down to view it with him.  I only watched it for a short time before I was completely bored.  My husband said it got better but I wasn't there to verify that, so maybe it does.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	good thought-provoking thriller. it kinda drags at the begining, but it was an over-all good film. the ending is very surprising and unexpected.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"I'm not even done watching this movie and I absolutely love it. This movie is all about that meloncholy time in a child's life where they fall into the chasm between innocent childhood and cynical ""growing up"" and the beauty of finding out it's still possible to believe in magic. As Santa says in the end... ""The true spirit of Christmas lies in your heart"".<br /><br />Even though this movie is about Christmas, it is not a singularly religious film (a well-placed Jewish elf makes that clear) and it's not sappy, sweet,  stuff ...I love the ""angel"" train hobo, the mafia-esque video-monitoring elves and the ""blue-collar"" style elves in charge of the presents.<br /><br />Ohh, this is just a beautiful story turned into a beautiful film and a new classic in our family from this point on. I cried at the end and was just so grateful that my kids can grow up knowing the true spirit of Christmas, which this movie helps teach."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Waited a long time and was not disappointed. The acting was wonderful and displayed the maturity of the cast. Each movie the acting has improved. I loved the books and was worried that they would not be depicted in depth as  so many are, but found the movie flowed beautifully. Am impatiently awaiting the second part from Amazon when it comes out. Ive purchased many books and DVDs from Amazon and am very satisfied with the price and speed of delivery.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I received great service and a great product. LOVE this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone as a great family movie.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"I'm writing this initial short-form of a review as a 'placeholder' for a more developed one that I will probably write as an update in the near future.<br />I will preamble it by saying that this film is what happens when the story concept of ""structure"" becomes a deaf-dumb buzzword; this story is what happens when you become too comfy-cozy with the Big Hollywood Industrial Complex; when profundity becomes diluted in a rationalized 'Loud, Dumb & Obvious' school-of-thought; when a filmmaker apparently becomes intoxicated with the guaranteed myth of his own ""Visionary"" label; when said filmmaker's projected response to logical critique is his own precedental ""Don't Try And Rationalize With Me""; when a film is made with an in-built, plausibly deniable, schizoid nature that simultaneously denies being a 'direct, solid' prequel (that merely has ""strands of Alien DNA"") while possessing a structure, idiom, and iconography that is not only wholly predicated on that first film, but betrays a shallow, derivative creativity.<br />Apparently, the conceptual premise of ""Prometheus"" entailed the exploration of 'something' derived (or inspired) from the Alien mythos (or should I say, in this case, FRANCHISE), but the result lacked any profundity or any actual 'exploration' (theological/existential discussions with disembodied android heads notwithstanding).<br />I find it almost mind-boggling to what degree this film is rife with plot 'illogic'. There is a sustained stream of sappy, simplistic narrative, dramatic oddities and weaknesses that just keep on begging frustrating questions.<br />I think I'm going to refer to this film as ""Plan 9 From LV-426"" from now on.<br /><br />At this point, I would like to quote fellow Amazon reviewer and ardent ""Prometheus"" crusader mao_soup:<br />""All da izdiots complainin bout dis movie is just haters. They just didn't get it. They went into dis expecting to see another ALIEN and when they got something differnt it turns them into little whiny babies (like goo lol). Y'all just have yer expectaters too high. Absolutelilly none wrong with this'n film or da plot or characters. In facts, dis is most thought-provoking film I ever seen. It made me realize god created us'n and all science and this evolutions is a bunch a hooey. Done diddly.""<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />""THE TRICK, WILLIAM POTTER, IS NOT MINDING THAT IT SUCKS.""<br />  David Ex Machina ...

B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	I originally invested in this product because of the special features, however ONLY the blue ray comes with the special features!  The DVD in this combo pack is the movie by it self.  If you do not own a Blue Ray player, (or are not planning to own one soon), DO NOT GET THIS COMBO PACK.  Just get the DVD with the less extensive special features.  The movie is worth owning, just the packing of the separate features is misleading which is why I am giving this product 1 star. The movie itself rates a much higher score.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	The man in the hat is back.  That's almost enough for me.  Indy is one of the great characters in american cinema.<br /><br />I think the rest of the reviews have covered plot, so I will justify my rating.  I thought it was great how there was continuity between the films.  For example, there was a great little moment in which Indy looks at a picture of his father and some music from Last Crusade plays.  It was great to hear Indy take on some of the mannerisms of his father which is believable and appropriate given the circumstances in which they are at play.  The characters behaved how they should have.  I know there is much criticism here, but realistically, people change when they age and I think that Indy and Marion were both very much in character.  The score was excellent and that old familiar Raiders march was missed for many years.<br /><br />I've heard much flack about the plot, and I guess my own feelings about that were that it wasn't that much more difficult to swallow than that of the previous films.<br /><br />I really hope there will be a 5th movie.  But if not, this was a satisfying end to a spectacular film series.  It was just absolute giddyness to see Indiana Jones crack that whip again.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Although not as well known as other Marvel Comic icons as Spiderman or X Men, this film adaptation of Iron Man works due to the sure hand of director Jon Favreau (Swingers, Elf) who cleverly mixes action, drama, humor, and a totally winning performance by comeback actor, Robert Downey Jr.  In terms of a first film showing a superhero's origin, it is the one of the best to date.<br /><br />Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer whose cavalier attitude and playboy appetite are matched only by his sheer genius in technology.  On a tour of his weaponry in Afghanistan, he is wounded in the heart by shrapnel and captured by rebels who order him to build a super weapon of mass destruction.  With the help of another civilian, Stark changes up and instead builds a powerful suit of high tech armor that sustains his weak heart and enables his escape but not without a price.  Guilt ridden and traumatized by his experiences, Stark has a literal change of heart and alters the militaristic direction of his company much to the chagrin of his elder partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).  A couple of friends, his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and military liaison, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), stick loyally by Stark's side despite his earlier predilections.  Intent on improving and perfecting his Iron Man suit, Stark experiments with its design and takes dangerous risks.  His mission is to utilize his Iron Man technology to fight the evil in the world, starting first in Afghanistan.  When the truth comes out about what Stark Industries is really doing with weapons sales, it leads to a deeper conspiracy and a battle of titans as Iron Man meets an old foe.<br /><br />Buffed and in terrific physical condition, Downey is quite convincing as the prodigy whose initial devil-may-care attitude must undergo a transformation.  (It is not without irony that the role and the person should merge in light of Downey's real life, personal setbacks.)  The movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes the most of his role.  Bridges is great at playing a businessman with a sinister agenda.  Paltrow strikes sparks with Downey and you yearn for more scenes with the two of them.  The same goes for Howard as Stark's best friend.  What is a little hard to swallow is how Pepper and Rhodes could put up with such a pompous persona in the early goings.<br /><br />Favreau has an amusing bit part as an assistant to Stark.  Further, the robotic voice that assists Stark in his technological work is actor Paul Bettany!  And yes, Stan (the man) Lee, one of the comic book creators, has a fleeting cameo.<br /><br />The scenes, which show Stark developing his updated Iron Man suit and test-driving it, are realistic and at times amusing.  The Iron Man suit 2.0 is a marvel of construction and is the coolest thing imaginable. There is no way that this concept of a hero could have been rendered as convincingly even a few years ago.  My how movie magic has caught up with these stories finally and done them justice.  It is clever how the film incorporates the original Iron Man design (which brings to mind a sort of poor man's version of Robocop) and progresses through its more modernized version.  Pure fans of the original comic (including myself) are thrilled at the reverence paid to the classic beginnings.<br /><br />There is an aerial battle between American fighter jets and Iron Man that is a lot of fun.  The special effects, while being among the most realistic and cleverly used in any action film, are well integrated with the strong narrative.  Despite the eye candy, you get the feeling that the filmmakers never lose sight of what the story is about and how to stay focused on the characters.  The pacing is excellent.<br /><br />In terms of subplots, the Afghan conflict hits close to home with the current war in Iraq.  Also, the secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gets an introduction as support for Stark and figures to have a bigger role in future Marvel movies; don't forget to stay until the credits are done for a bonus.  The film has an edge about it in dialogue and theme, and is better for it especially in the final scene, which is surprising and has implications for future adventures.<br /><br />I would put this film on par with Batman Begins and Spiderman, not bad company.  While not as emotionally stirring as the best moments of X Men United or Spiderman 2, this is only the first of what likely will be a long running franchise.  If the sequel can maintain the same quality as this effort, we could be in for the best superhero movie yet!  And lest there be any doubt about Favreau's ability to take on comic heroes, don't worry; he understands what they mean and how to do them justice.  He `get's it'!
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	I love the workout! Lost 10 pound after 4 weeks!!! I am committed. Looking foward to the next weeks!! My family can see results. Love it!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This is a very funny video. I highly recommend it to every one who wants to laugh.
B008UBYTRG	1.0	b	I only got 5 minutes into this. Then I skipped through to see if it still had that canned laughter later on. Not funny. No, really. Did not like. I sorted out Amazon's Instant Video to show the highest rated first. This is the best rated movie or show of all time? Well it was in that slot.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This was a great movie. Very informative. I was raised on a chicken farm and it is awsome that the poultry industry is really shown here. It is completely true. I have had two uncles go under do to the chicken companies. Again great movie. Not just for the left wing liberals.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie is action-packed, bright, fast, and fun.  It's no wonder why it is still popular after two years of being released.  I have a 16-month old son, and a son going on three years old.  They love this movie!  Great music... I plan to purchase the soundtrack (if available) for Christmas for listening in our car.  Enjoy!
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"I was apprehensive about going to see ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" because I was very disenchanted by the last film in the series, ""Goblet of Fire."" However, ""Phoenix"" surpassed all my expectations. There are a few small things about the movie that bothered me, but overall, I think it was brilliant.<br /><br />This film is based on the fifth novel in the Harry Potter series. I'm sure most people are familiar with the plot, but basically this is Harry's fifth year at Hogwarts, and it gets off to a very crappy start. The Ministry of Magic attempts to expel Harry from school because he used magic to defend himself when dementors attacked him and his cousin, Dudley. Also, the majority of people think that Harry and Professor Dumbledore are lying about the return of Lord Voldemort, and everyone treats Harry like he has the plague. To top it all off, the Ministry has appointed one of its own members, Dolores Umbridge, to fill the vacant position of Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher at Hogwarts. Umbridge wastes no time wreaking havoc in the school and using all means necessary to put the Ministry's stamp on things. Meanwhile, Harry is distraught over mysterious dreams and visions that disturb him in his sleep. The film builds up to Harry's discovery of a new connection he has to Voldemort, and everything culminates in a violent encounter deep within the confines of the Department of Mysteries.<br /><br />I was blown away by this movie. It was just as dark and gritty as I'd hoped it would be, and as it needed to be in order to stay true to the book. Obviously, a lot of material had to be cut for the film adaptation, but I think the screenwriters did an excellent job editing the unnecessary parts and making the story flow together so smoothly on screen.<br /><br />Here are some of my favorite things about the film, along with a few gripes. (Warning: The rest of this review contains major spoilers, so continue reading at your own risk!)<br /><br />+ The new additions to the cast were amazing, especially the actresses who played Bellatrix LaStrange (Helena Bonham Carter), Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). Bonham Carter is amazing in everything she does, and the first time I read ""Phoenix,"" I knew she had to play Bellatrix...I just wish she had a bit more screen time! Staunton was absolutely perfect as Umbridge. I would have enjoyed seeing Umbridge's character be slightly more sinister at times, but really, I have no complaints. And as for Lynch, she was born to play the part of Luna Lovegood, hands down!<br /><br />+ The thestrals looked awesome, as did Kreacher the house elf.<br /><br />+ I thought Harry's relationship with Cho Chang was very sweet and well done. Their kiss under the mistletoe was so cute!<br /><br />+ The appearance of the Dark Mark tattoo on the Death Eaters was very well done: super creepy!<br /><br />+ The Ministry of Magic looked incredible in the film: it was just like I imagined it while reading the book. I was also quite impressed with the scene depicting the jailbreak from Azkaban: very slick!<br /><br />+ Generally, most of the plot changes were very slight and only served to better enhance the story for the screen (Harry seeing the memory of his father and Snape by using occlumency instead of spying in the pensieve; the Weasley twins only causing one major disturbance for Umbridge; etc.)<br /><br />- The character of Tonks (Natalia Tena) was introduced for the first time in this film. She looked really cool, but we didn't get to see much of her, which was a shame.<br /><br />- Speaking of missing characters, where the heck was Mundungus Fletcher?! His absence didn't really affect the plot of the movie too much, but I'm sure there were many fans of the book that were disappointed Mundungus was cut out altogether.<br /><br />- Rita Skeeter and Professor Lockhart were also missing from the film. Again, their absences didn't hurt the movie, but I was really hoping for a brief Kenneth Branagh cameo.<br /><br />- I don't understand why Kreacher's role in the whole trick involving Sirius wasn't played up more. We saw Kreacher twice, and Sirius even gave him the order to ""go away,"" but no one ever explained how Kreacher was the one who helped Voldemort lure Harry into coming to the Ministry.<br /><br />- There was no Sirius/Snape confrontation. Major bummer!<br /><br />- We never saw Dumbledore instruct Snape to meet up with Voldemort and the rest of the Death Eaters. This is the one omission from the film that bothered me the most. The significance of that event plays a big part in book seven, so I wonder how it will be explained in the next film.<br /><br />- Although the final scenes at the Ministry were good, I was a little disappointed with the way Sirius was killed. He never really dueled it out with Bellatrix: she just sort of appeared and mumbled ""avada kedavra"" under her breath, and it was all over. It should have been much more dramatic with more build-up to it. Also, it was never explained how Dumbledore and the other members of the Order knew that Harry and his friends were at the Ministry that night. Finally, the whole Harry/Voldemort possession thing at the end was kind of weird. I guess all these things were done in the essence of time and to make things look more dramatic on screen, but I think it could have been a bit better.<br /><br />Despite a few minor flaws, ""Phoenix"" is possibly the best Harry Potter film yet. I think the movie really stayed true to the spirit of the book, and I enjoyed it very much. I'll probably go back to see it in the theatre at least once more."
B0006989TE	4.0	b	Saw the movie and was not disappointed. It was a great movie which has a twisted ending that will have u thinking at the end of the movie... In my opinion, this movie is as good as The Sixth Sense..<br /><br />As u may already know, M. Night Shyamalan, the director, has his usual cameo roles in all his movies.... Look out for him in a cameo role once again in this movie..<br /><br />This movie is definitely better than SIGNS.<br /><br />Recommended..
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Great movie - my 2 year old simply loves Cars and this movie sends a good message about friendship. My daughter also enjoys this movie. It is a hit for all ages!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Great picture and sound quality, DVD was yesterday, luckily.<br />A very positive story, and not just for kids.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This is a must see for all animal lovers and those who care what goes into their bodies.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	this is a great way to loose weight and gain a ripped bod! my sons love it and just start out slow and build up to the level that they are working at. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAa++++++++++++++++++
B001KZG99A	1.0	b	This service was such a long & tedious one that I will never again purchase anything from amazon. It has been OVER a month & I have still yet to receive my complete order. Not only is the process so long & drawn out, amazon promises discounts yet only if it is Not involved with third party so when u think you're actually getting a deal, in reality you are not. I might as well have purchased all of my movies from walmart, I would rather pay the difference from there than trying to rely on an unreliable service. God Bless.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Purchased the DVD after seeing Jeff Dunham's act on the Comedy Channel.  He and his characters are hysterical.  My favorite is Walter; next favorite is Achmed.  I received my purchase timely and in perfect shape.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	"In my opinion, the HBO series is NOTHING like the books!<br /><br />The characters are NOTHING like the characters in the books.<br /><br />AND to top it all off, the series does not follow the storylines in the books.<br /><br />I am currently reading book 3 Club Dead. Almost done. I am so confused after having watched this series while reading the books that I am going to go back and start the books over.<br />They have twisted the story so much in the HBO series that it (to me) barely resembles the books. And it is only the first season!<br />Save the money and read the books.<br />They are really GREAT!<br />Sorry but... This series ""Sucks""- LOL"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"I'm Not Much Of A Writer On Topics Like This Or Anything For That Matter.  Some People May Not Like This Movie, But If You Liked Any Other Movie Adapted From A Comic Book This One Is A Must See.  There Are Not That Many Heroes From The Comics That Do Not Have Superhuman Abilities.  Batman, Daredevil, And Iron Man Are The Three That Come To Mind And To Overcome Evil With Only Gadgets And Skill Is Impressive.  Even Though It Has Been Said That Iron Man Did Not In Many Ways Stay True To The Comics It Is Still An Entertaining ""Marvel"".  No Pun Intended, Being That Iron Man Was Published By Marvel Comics.  I Don't Want To Get Into Detail About What The Movie Is About, Just Keep In Mind That The First Of Every Comic Adapted Into A Movie Tells A Back Story Of How The Title Character Became Who They Were Intended To Be, Thus There Are A Few Slow Moments.  However There Are Enough Special Effects And Comic Book Action To Be Entertained.  Blu-Ray Is How Iron Man Was Intended To Be Viewed With Intense Visual Clarity And Dynamic Sound.  I Hope This Helps And Enjoy."
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	First I would like to say that I have several combo disks and have never had a problem with any of them.<br /><br />I thought that the picture quality was better on this HD DVD than the prior Harry Potter HD DVD, which I also own. The sound was also somewhat better than the prior Harry Potter HD DVD.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself my son thought it was the worst of the Harry Potter movies, but I thought it was one of the best, if not the best. Maybe my son was looking for more action than this movie has, while I enjoyed the story and the acting.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	very good - not up to other movies - definetly left no doubt about sequel coming out!
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"The movie has it's good points. It doesn't have a sharp ending but it has a<br />basic meaning ""No Country For Old Men.""  Tommy Lee Jones illustrates the point at the end. Overall - not bad, in fact pretty good. Best Picture???<br />Goes to show that ""crack"" has made it to the Oscar Judges.  Well it's about time - they are the last ones in Hollywood to get addicted. It's a bad drug<br />especially if you have been watching Sponge Bob for 72 hours straight on ""Crack"" and then watch ""No Country For Old Men"" it would seem like the best picture. But if you weren't on ""Crack"" and had seen all the great movies of 2007 the word ""Oscar"" would never be spoken."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	It is one of the funniest comedy acts I've seen.  He is great.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I can guarantee you this will be THE demo of the year, next to the PIXAR Shorts on Blu-ray.  The DVD was reference and this version will be a direct from the digital source porting at 1920x1080p with the original 24 bit audio master!<br /><br />Yes, it will also be in 2.35:1 as it was in the theaters.<br /><br />The heck with Paramount and their greed-based decision to go to the lesser HD-DVD, at least for a while.  Disney and other Blu-ray studios are delivering the goods.  24 bit uncompressed PCM audio on HD-DVD with high bitrate video?? HA! I think not.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Finally, they finally get it. This is the first time that a director has accepted the brilliance of a comic (graphic novel) at face value and attempted to bring it to a larger audience by adapting it for the big screen. Hopefully the success of this film will be a cue to movie makers everywhere that making comic book adoptions goes way beyond using licensed character names and state of the art CGI. Sin City the film is brilliant because Sin City the graphic novel series is brilliant (Not to take anything away from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarintino's direction). The movie does an excellent job capturing the characters, setting, plot and overall mood and style of the novels. Like the novels, this movie is not for those who are easily offended by scenes of graphic violence. But like so many other Tarintino and Rodriguez movies Sin City is a world all its own and should not be viewed through a realistic lens. For those looking for a true adoption of a dark comic Sin City is for you, for those looking for Spiderman 3 might want to skip this one. It's just not that kind of movie.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00118T63C"">No Country for Old Men</a><br />The Coen Brothers outdid themselves once more. Kept me on the edge of my seat. I love it when they go against type and you have no idea where the Dynamic Duo (Coen's) takes you.<br /><br />The very best performance by Javier Bardem. For once an actor who deserves the Oscar actually receives it."
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	How are they allowed to sell a movie along with a digital copy still (October) when apparently the digital copy offer expired in the middle of september. I bought this version of the movie solely for the digital copy, when I could have saved money. I've never been less pleased with Amazon.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  It's very hard to find a Christian movie, or any movie for that matter, that doesn't have explicit language in it.  I highly recommend this movie!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	...is that M Night's brilliance does not lie in his ability to trick or surprise the viewer, it is his ability to entertain the viewer.<br /><br />To be honest, I've never found his plot twists to be especially clever or unpredictable, but I have always loved his movies because of the way he involves the viewer from the first scene onwards.<br /><br />Even with Signs, which was at best only an average sci fi movie, M Night still succeeded in wowing his audience due to the metaphorical layering that is present in all of his movies, including The Village.<br /><br />Yep, much of the hidden truth of The Village can be guessed ahead of time, but that does not stop it being an intensely involving movie.<br /><br />This is another superb and well-cast movie from a great director, who is too often being judged by the wrong criteria.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I have seen Jeff in concert and he is a great comedian.  This DVD presents all new material and is laugh out loud funny.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone that needs a good laugh.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	I recieved my order quickly which is a plus for me.  Although the I did not recieve the collector's sleeve I should have with my order.  The disc were in prestine shape.  Once contacting the seller about what was missing.  My money was quickly refunded and the promise of recieving the missing cover was made.  As of yet I have not recieved the missing sleeve but then again it didn't cost me anything either.  So all in all speedy service.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	As far as I am concerned, this is the best movie I have seen all year and I see alot of them. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as well as the supporting cast. This movie never drags, is funny, shocking and thrilling. Better than all of the big hits put together, including The Dark Knight.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	Can't watch this in the day time it's so dark you can't see a thing. Have to watch at night with no lights on. Very disappointed. Good thing I read the book.
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	It would have been better if I knew anything about Iron Man going into it.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	For those of who you haven't seen Iron Man, I won't speak much about the movie itself; there are more than enough places for movie reviews.  What I will say is that this Blu-Ray edition does a good job of bringing the feeling of the big screen at home.  The video is very clear provided you are using high def, and the sound track is very cool for those who have multi-speaker systems.  Using the PCM stream, you can appreciate individual bullets in different areas and some more subtle sounds during the battle sequences that you may not have noticed.  This movie is probably one of my favorites to show off sound effects.  All in all a very nice way to enjoy your home theater and a fun movie to watch.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"This dvd was great. I missed having Bubba J, but Ackmed the dead terriost was pretty cool. Jeff is really talented and this dvd is great to give the whole family a good laugh.<br />Note: For more mature audiences. With comments like ""I'll kill you"" and ""I'm gay"" I wouldn't let me kids watch it unless they have been well educated. Kids repeat things. Just wanted to put it out there to be on the safe side."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Movie was awesome.  I figured it would be a boring, pushing God down your throat type of movie.  It was an awesome movie.  It really gave me food for thought and is an example of how we should live our lives.  We may not like the message because it glarenly makes you realize how far we have strayed from the way God wants us to lives.  MOST IMPORTANT: IT made me realize how one day I will feel on Judgement Day when I stand before God and have to face the sins I have committed and be in God's presense.  IF you like this movie, Check out Pastor Billy Crone on [...]
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"What a terrible ending. Here the movie was pretty good, and it all built up anticipation as to how it would all turn out.<br /><br />HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!<br /><br />It was like the filmmakers suddenly ran out of money or something.  The movie just suddenly STOPPED.  No ending!<br /><br />There was no closure, it made no sense, and it leaves you saying ""HUH??""<br /><br />Therefore, it really made me MAD that I sat through almost two hours for nothing. This is the most unsatisfying movie of all time.  Don't waste your two hours on this thing."
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"I was seriously scared by this movie until about half way through.  Then I could relax and wonder what the twist would be this time.  And even though I figured it out, it was so well done that I wasn't disapointed.<br /><br />Casting here is just great.  All the characters are human, well-written and fit perfectly into the world created.  And, like everyone else, I found Bryce Dallas Howard's Ivy charming.<br /><br />With most of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, I enjoy them but don't feel the need to watch them over and over - once you see it and then watch again to pick up all the clues, that's pretty much it.  But the characters of ""The Village"" are so engaging that this was one we actaully bought.<br /><br />And what is the deal with ""Lady in the Water"" having a highter rating??"
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Sin City is a series of graphic novels created by Frank Miller and brought to the screen by director Robert Rodriguez. The film focuses on 3 graphic novels in the series: The Hard Goodbye, That Yellow Bastard and The Big Fat Kill. The best one being The Hard Goodbye, which is about a big guy named Marv who searches for the guy who set him up for murdering a hooker named Goldie. Now, aside from all the great actors, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Bruce Willis and so on, and aside from the great cinematography (shot entirely on green screen), this 2 disc recut and extended dvd has it all. On one disc you have the original theatrical cut with 2 different commentaries plus loads of really cool extras like how Rodriguez conviced Frank Miller to make the film. And then on the second disc you have the film seperated into 4 different stories with over 20 added minutes plus a lot more special features such as the all green screen high speed version of the film. And even aside from that you get the first graphic novel in the series also. I would deffinately recommend this dvd even if you already own the original dvd. Becuase of all the extras and the being able to view the movie into four different stories this dvd is worth all the money. If you don't already own it buy it, and if you do already own the original dvd buy it. This dvd is hands down the best dvd of 2005.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Walter, Peanut and Jose are quite funny.  The pimp and trailer trash puppets aren't.  However, I find myself crying every time I watch Jeff and Walter.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	The worst Indiana Jones movie ever.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  There are no words to describe this abomination of a movie.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"There was a big question mark looming over the theatrical adaptation of Marvel's Iron Man property. It was in the guise of director Jon Favreau. Now, don't get me wrong, I love the Favs, but when I heard he was helming a big budget comic book flick...let's just say I was a little worried. Once his cast was set and the fanboys started humming across the internet I started to ease into the decision with high anticipation. Thankfully, after finally seeing the finished product, I was not disappointed in the least. With a great mix of the professionalism and stakes seen in both Spider-Man and X-Men and the comic wit and sheer fun of Fantastic Four, Iron Man shows how a comic can be brought to the screen successfully without all the added drama and weight. We finally have a film with the essence of what makes these picture books so popular, the action and mythology along with a sense of adventure and humor. Favreau never bogs us down with overwrought emotions nor speaks down to us with gags and poorly written jokes. Instead he delivers on his promises and gives us a solid initiation into what could be a great trilogy or more.<br /><br />Favreau seems to have had an idea to get an origin story out while not boring us with long drawn out back story. His ability to give us dual information at once is nicely orchestrated, showing Tony Stark in his basement creating while the TV in the background explains what is happening in the outside world of the Middle East and inside his own company. We as an audience are allowed to put the pieces together amidst the witty banter of Stark and the wonderful special effects. By the end of the film it is quite amazing how much information you will realize you now know, all culminating in a decent final battle, but more importantly a segue into the inevitable sequel. We are allowed entrance into the character evolution of Stark as he goes from war profiteer to man of action and cause, all while seeing the technology improve and advance before our eyes. Much like Batman, we have a hero here that needs help in fighting crime. He has no superhuman abilities besides his brain and being able to see his thoughts go from paper to reality is a feat of magic. Every stage is shown, every failure and success. It's quite the ride in and of itself, but when you add onto it the threat of global war and destruction, it can only get better.<br /><br />The real success here is in the bold move of casting an actor over-40 to be a superhero. This takes guts, because no matter how appropriate it is, most studios would have said, ""no, change the story and make him younger so we can churn out as many of these babies as we can."" I don't know how he did it, but Favreau got Marvel to get Robert Downey Jr. to play Stark, a sarcastic Lothario with the brain capacity of Einstein. I truly can't think of anyone better suited to the role and he proves it by nailing every single scene. I'm sure there was some ad-libbing, but even if not, his comic delivery and ability to switch on a dime to a sincere seriousness at will shows his masterful craft.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast, they all do well. Jeff Bridges plays the bombastic creature of villainy over-the-top, but appropriately so; Terrence Howard is nice as the friend and military liaison, not given much to do, but definitely sowing seeds for the future; and Gwyneth Paltrow is good as the sweet assistant Pepper Potts who at times seems a little underwritten and more female prop than anything else, but comes through with some nice moments in a very comic sort of way. I also really liked Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's savior, and Clark Gregg as the head of S.H.I.E.L.D. Good to see Favreau giving another actor turned director props, (Gregg's directorial debut comes out later this year in the form of Chuck Palahniuk's Choke). I just wish he would have shied away from putting himself in the film. It's one thing to be seen split-second, (like Stan Lee), but its another to give yourself a thankless role with multiple scenes, just adding fuel to the fire on people's opinions of egotism stemming from the drinking game created off of the TV show ""Dinner for Five"" and how many references to Swingers was made each episode. I'll forgive, though, because, once again, I'm a big fan.<br /><br />One can't forget that this is an action film above all else, so we can't just praise the actors; every effect is also quite brilliant. Those scenes of Iron Man flying amongst fighter jets in the trailer seemed really lame, but when in context they deliver. The suit itself is amazing as well, through every mach stage right to the end. My main highlight, however, was with the computer systems that Stark utilizes. The multiple screens, instant holographic reproductions, and ability to actually interact with those 3D representations is stunning. We can create them in fantasy, but it's just too bad we can't yet in real life.<br /><br />Now Iron Man is not a perfect film, nor even a perfect comic book adaptation. What it is, though, is a fun, comic actioner that should light up the box office. The final showdown is a bit of a whimper in comparison to the back story and machine creation; a crucial element is saved from destruction in the one contrived bit of screen writing, (not quite utilized in the way I thought, although still for the same means); and some moments seem a tad campy rather than witty, but otherwise this is some topnotch cinema that should definitely be seen on the big screen. I can't wait to see how the story progresses in a couple years."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is a great source of entertainment. Not only is it funny, but it is ok for the whole family to watch (PG)of course.
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	I gave it 1 star because there was no option for zero. Why did Charlize ever do this stupid movie?  Terrible writing, stupid plot, fake story.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"I never miss a film starring Javier Bardem.He is in my opinion the #1 actor in the world today,and his work as Anton Chighuhr in ""No Country for Old Men"" is stellar.Fortunately, the director LETS him act (or in this case ""be""), because that has not always been the case (latest debacle,""Love in the Time of Cholera"").That said, this is one tense and mercilessly unrelenting film.I did not enjoy it in the least.I squirmed and squealed and hid my eyes....and the blood...YIKES....BUT that doesn't mean that I cannot appreciate a truly outstandingly made film.""No Country for Old Men"" fires on all cylinders.Bardem is the spark.I will probably never see it again.....because I simply won't forget it!5 ""oddly-reserved"" enthusiastic stars."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This movie is a great adaptation of the original story.  It is fantastical in its delivery of the sense of wonder it brings to the imagination when reading.  I like this interpretation of the story; the imagery is stunning and so much fun to watch!  Brilliantly done ... and the detail in digitizing the characters adds to the overall presentation to make it more real... I want to catch the next trip to the North Pole!
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"Warning this movie is not a thriller or a chiller, a horror<br /><br />movie. It's a love story that had a lot of potential if<br /><br />it were not so monotonous, two sided, and unilateral.<br /><br />I happen to love movies i mean if they are Good there are<br /><br />Good everyone has a different opinion. So it would<br /><br />seem a Film is really only subverse and Relative when<br /><br />anyone comes down to telling the truth about a film.<br /><br />That is why i am telling you the truth.. Dont buy this<br /><br />movie. I felt Saddened at watching this movie, not because<br /><br />of any thing in the movie but because it really threw<br /><br />me for a loop how sorry it was. The reason i was sad was<br /><br />because i pictured all the poor people who were actually<br /><br />going to buy this film or already had and were watching<br /><br />what i was right then. Right then it occured to me i would<br /><br />write a review to warn other people about this film.<br /><br />Personally i didnt feel sad for myself i was perplexed<br /><br />throughout the films entire beggining. Here's Why.<br /><br />But first i would like to apologize to anyone who<br /><br />watched it. I DID like and still do Signs and The Sixth Sense.<br /><br />However i would like to apologize on behalf of such a<br /><br />movie so richly colored in duo tone, quality yes but in Depth<br /><br />as well.<br /><br />1) It took 20 minutes into the film to get any sense of<br /><br />rythym, before hand of which was wallpapered with<br /><br />odd banter from the pages of the script. It was so<br /><br />odd all i could do was laugh and honestly i was perplexed<br /><br />because nothing they were saying made any sense that was<br /><br />tangible. I felt myself for a lack of words in fact.<br /><br />Perhaps that is the POWER of this film and M night shalamiman<br /><br />Ya that's it. IT TAKES OUR VOICES AND MINDS.<br /><br />2) Only later it became interesting or at least i thought<br /><br />so, in actuality it turned out it was only relief from<br /><br />being so bored where i was.<br /><br />3) The camera angles were all very basic nothing besides<br /><br />the basic textbook shot. It was so sad. I kept wishing<br /><br />i was there to say ""Your Doing it all Wrong,<br /><br />Try this or this for christ sakes.!""<br /><br />4)The guy who wrote the movie........Put Himself in the Movie.<br /><br />""Shivers"" NO STARS AT ALL. As a writer and dierector<br /><br />it is his or her responsibility to amuse or capture us.. instead<br /><br />i was just lost. It very ironic they had a blind girl finding her<br /><br />way through the woods in this film. Kudos to Hellen Keller and walking sticks i GUESS........................... oh my god.<br /><br />This movie wasnt Horror it was Horrible. It left me scared alright.. scared to pay another buck to see another one of<br /><br />M night SHALAMALANYMINYMANMANS films.<br /><br />Oh my god what a clincher. Dont say you werent warned.<br /><br />This Movie stinks like Dirty Socks and Boiled cabbage.<br /><br />SHrieks!!!!!"
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Mirror Mirror on the wall, is this the greatest Snow White movie of them all? The answer to that question is no. And I had a feeling that this was going to be a pretty bad Snow White movie. But I gave it a chance because who knows it could have been a really great movie.<br /><br />Pros: Visually the fantasy was great I loved seeing the magical creatures and the forest and I liked how there was more of a back story to the Evil Queen as to why she became evil. The only good actors that shined were Chris Hemsworth (as the Huntsman)and Sam Claflin(as Prince William)and both actors were nice to look at too! But thats all.<br /><br />Cons: We already saw the best parts of the movie in the previews. The acting from Charlize Theron was over the top and she acted like a hormonal woman rather than an evil Queen. Kristen Stewerts acting as Snow White was terrible but not surprising. She had her mouth open a lot and didn't speak a whole lot except grunt and make sounds. She also had 2 looks on her face being confused or looking annoyed. And her british accent was akward and not believable. I also found out that many other actress's were considered for the part of Snow White but the director was probably desperate to make a movie. And the love triangle between her, The Huntsman and the Prince was ridiculous. It was like Twilight all over again. Sorry Twihards Edward and Jacob took a break from Bella! Can't we just have one main girl and one main guy be together? Enough already with the love triangles. Even with the love triangle when her true love kissed her YOU KNEW who he was and you knew who she was going to end up with. Even with the love triangle there wasn't enough romance.<br /><br />I think if the director wrote a better story and he had better actress's to play Snow White and the Evil Queen this movie would have stood a chance at doing great. But for people who haven't seen the movie yet I suggest you wait to watch it on t.v. or just rent it and then you decide whether its worth the buy or not. Just don't expect this movie to be an academy award winner or the acting to be believable.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is an awesome movie!  The acting, authenticity, scenery, everything about this is outstanding!  I was drawn into this story from the begining.  I will watch this many times!  Eva
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Is it any good?<br /><br />Snow White and the Huntsman is the latest to be adapted into a live action, but this time with quite a big twist. The film takes on a Lord of the Rings feel, bringing it a dark style, but ultimately one we've seen many times before. Kristen Stewart as Snow White is predictably wooden in her performance, making the fact that she is highest paid actress in the world completely absurd. Chris Hemsworth is adequate, with the script and style doing nothing for him besides giving him a pay check. By far the star of the film is Charlize Theron, owning the role of The Queen with her performance. However, the whole film screamed of mediocre, taking the `best bits' from other similar films. Even though I was watching the film in Gold Class with unlimited popcorn and wine, it didn't make watching the film any more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the film is likely to remembered more for the affair between Stewart and Sanders than the film itself. Casting couch anyone?<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The climatic fight is pretty decent, I guess.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The Dwarves in the Huntsman were played by actors who had their faces digitally transmuted onto small bodies. This caused a protest from the Little People of America.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"This is the first movie I've seen with Stewart.  What is wrong with her?  Does she always act in this manner, or was she preoccupied with her affair?  The few words she spoke, she stated them worse than when someone reads aloud from a book.  Her ""fighting"" speech - she just yelled the words out.  Huh?!  Has she no experience in human suffering, that she can not remotely fathom what it would be like to be locked in an underground prison cell for so many years, to lose both parents, to see the depths of sorrow in her kingdom?... so that she can not bring these emotions to her acting?<br /><br />And what was happening with the last scene (coronation scene)?  Why was she just standing there & almost pretending to have a 'climax' ???<br /><br />The Queen & the Huntsman were great.  The scenery was beautiful, the effects (ok, except for that one scene) worked well.  But .... the main character is a joke......!!!"
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	I'm so suprised to see so many here writing poor reviews for this film.  Its Indiana Jones.  What's not to love?  Personally i HATED the 2nd Indy film, the kids being kidnapped/heart being pulled beating out of the guy, eating monkey brains nonsense, but this film was much more entertaining.<br /><br />I loved the idea of his son being a new character (i could see more of the series with this scenerio)  It was full of action and nostalgia.  My 12 yr old said he loved it more than the Dark Knight (tho i had a stupid grin on my face during that wonderful movie too)<br /><br />I have little to say in the way of a bad review, i do think the chase scene could have been better, but the ants were cool, I dont know, i thought it was great, like i said im suprised at the number of crybabies who were expecting something more than an action movie with the man in the hat and his whip.....  It is what it is, pure fluff entertainment!
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	After a long delay, I finally have seen Sin City.  The film is undeniably a visual masterpiece.  The movie looks unlike anything I have ever seen.  I will preface the rest of the review this, I am not familiar with Frank Miller's stories.  I cannot imagine that the movie watcher has to have any familiarity with the content, but I have not.  I usually love movies like this, like Pulp Fiction.  However, I just could not get into this movie at all.<br /><br />I was not put off by the non-ending violence, but what is the point?  The characters are stale and there is not one person in the movie worthy of emotional investment.  The movie plays like a visually stunning gore filled yawn.  After the two hours were over I did not care one way or the other about the characters.  I am sure there will be more tales from Sin City, but unless there is more character development, I think I will pass.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	great movie, the hitman is weird but somewhat funny. great acting for all the actors.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"The greatest strength - one of many - in ""Prometheus"" is that it is decidedly not another ""Alien"" movie. It's a film that exists entirely in its own framework, only borrowing elements from the series and hinting at things that would happen in other films.<br /><br />While ""Prometheus"" is clearly a prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise, I now understand why Ridley Scott has said multiple times that it's not a ""direct prequel"" to the series. It's not like last year's ""The Thing,"" which literally ends to lead into the opening shots of the 1982 classic. ""Prometheus"" sets the stage for ""Alien,"" yes, but it leaves plenty unexplained.<br /><br />So if you're expecting a retread of Ridley Scott's original monster movie in space, you'll be sorely disappointed. And that's why I think some reviews of the film are coming in so soft.<br /><br />But what were you really expecting? Even a quick glance over Ridley Scott's filmography shows that he doesn't tread the same ground twice. Even films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" which share a lot of themes and elements, are entirely different movies. Why would anyone expect ""Alien: The Prequel - The Tragic Journey of the Space Jockey""?<br /><br />At it's heart, ""Prometheus"" is a grand piece of speculative fiction, which opens some thought-provoking doors as to humanity, our beginnings, morality and immortality. It's the story of a scientific vessel traveling to a distant planet to discover our extraterrestrial ancestors. However, upon arrival, the crew finds some terrifying things and uncovers some unpleasant secrets about our origins.<br /><br />I won't say anything more than that, but rather will let the film sit for itself. Things in ""Prometheus"" need to be revealed by the film, not by trailers, marketing and spoilery reviews. Yes, there are bits and pieces you will recognize from the ""Alien"" universe, but it gives a very different view of that universe.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace holds her own as the lead of the film, playing a bit of a precursor to Ellen Ripley. Her character is tough, adorable and complex, and she can be both the victim and the hero. She is supported by a strong cast that includes Charlize Theron as the corporate bigwig driving the mission, Guy Pearce as the aging benefactor and Idris Elba as the overly cliched but still enjoyable pilot.<br /><br />Still, the star that outshines Rapace in this film is Michael Fassbender as David, they synthetic human keeping control of the ship. (Yes, there's gotta be one of those in every movie, it seems.) Fassbender has been impressive in both indie and mainstream films lately, and here's another feather in his cap. It's an understated role, but like any great character, there's as much in what he doesn't say and do as is in what he does.<br /><br />""Prometheus"" is best enjoyed is a relative vacuum from the franchise that left Scott's hands more than 30 years ago. It's good to be familiar with the films, but it's best to expect a grand space journey along the lines of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" with teeth and less psychedelic drugs. It is not quite what you'll expect, and it's a better film for it."
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DTPZNY"">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a> certainly isn't the best Indiana Jones movie. That title probably goes to Raiders. Still, Crystal Skull is still a fun movie and certainly has much of the feel of the Indiana Jones series. Despite some risks and questionable choices, it works well overall. The relationship between Indy and his lost son, Mutt, is actually one of the better parts of the film. Mutt is a likable character who grows over the film. Unlike some of the other characters (more on that later) he actually brings quite a bit to the movie.<br /><br />The plot works surprisingly well too. I initially thought it would be a cheesy aliens movie, but the alien presence is subtle. By and large, this is still Indy going into lost cities looking for treasure. I admit it's not the greatest MacGuffin and not my first choice, but given that choice Spielberg and Lucas used the idea well.  I suspect whether you like Crystal Skull or not depends upon your view of the Crystal Skull as the MacGuffin. If you hate it and can't accept it, then you won't like the film.<br /><br />That said, the movie suffers from a few misguided choices. First, as others have noted, there are too many over-the-top situations. I know Indiana Jones isn't supposed to be realistic, but too often the characters would survive some impossible situation - the multiple waterfalls, driving onto a tree branch, and, of course, nuking the fridge - and I'd nearly roll my eyes. However, more than the particular scenarios is that by and large the characters faced these situations passively, by essentially ""bracing for impact.""<br /><br />Also, I didn't think bringing Marion (Karen Allen) back worked so well.  It got about 30 seconds worth of nostalgia, but otherwise she doesn't really do much. Sure she's there and drives the duck, but it feels like the movie barely reintroduces us to her before she's off marrying Indy. I suspect this is because the movie already has a lot of supporting characters, particularly Mac and Oxley, most of who are simply not that compelling. It's simply too many people to introduce into a film like this. Even in Last Crusade, with it's large ensemble, we had already met Brody and Salleh before and could empathize more with the characters.<br /><br />Overall, I'm quite pleased that Spielberg and Lucas decided to make a 4th Indiana Jones movie. It's not the greatest of the bunch, but it certainly doesn't detract from the series. It's worth a try if you're an Indy fan."
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	"Rookie race car Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson of ""Rushmore,"" ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Behind Enemy Lines"" fame) finished the Piston Cup in a three-way tie with two other cars, including The King (Richard Petty), who is retiring.  The King is leaving behind a position as a product endorser that Lightning McQueen would love to have.  Another race between the three winners is ordered to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.<br /><br />Lightning McQueen heads off to California in a trailer pulled by Mack (John Ratzenberger).  McQueen insists Mack drive through the night to California.  Unfortunately, Mack falls asleep and leaves McQueen in the desert.  Reminiscent of ""Doc Hollywood,"" McQueen ends up in the town of Radiator Springs, where he needs to perform public service.  Similar to Michael J. Fox's character in ""Doc Hollywood,"" McQueen is arrogant and over-confident.  Fortunately, his experiences with the denizens of Radiator Springs may change his attitude and his life.<br /><br />Radiator Springs is filled with all sorts of characters.  Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt) is a former big-city attorney who dreamed of a slower pace and the beauty of the desert.  Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) is an enigmatic character with a secret past.  George Carlin is amusing as Fillmore.  Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub and Larry the Cable Guy all voice various characters with their own hopes, dreams and past.<br /><br />The question remains, where does all this lead?  The answer is that it leads to a funny story with a moral hidden behind it all; perhaps more than one moral.<br /><br />I was reluctant to see this movie in the theaters when it came out.  I am not a NASCAR fan and the commercials for this movie seemed to focus too much on the racing aspect of the movie.  Fortunately, while the movie opens and closes with a race, the rest of the movie is about life, and life, just like this movie, should be enjoyed, and there should be humor, which this movie has.<br /><br />This movie is a bit lighter than previous Pixar films.  However, the graphics are phenomenal and the story is easy to follow.  The detail in the scenery and in the machinery continuously amazed me.  Digital animation has come a long way in the last couple of decades and ""Cars"" is contains every technical achievement possible in animation.  I think the kind of animation in ""Cars"" no longer amazes many of us because we have seen it so many times before.  Fortunately, the story is enjoyable and there is reasonably good humor to keep you interested to the end of the movie.  There is a slow spot in the middle of the movie, but the animation fascinated me at that point and I was trying to figure out how this movie might end so that I hardly noticed the slow point.<br /><br />""Cars"" has it all.  Great animation, a reasonably good story, an all-star cast, and humor.  There are a number of inside jokes, most of which I failed to catch.  The movie is also family friendly, even for the youngest members of the family.  This movie will be one that most families will want for their DVD library.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	So happy that Amazon sent me this movie.  Now I can watch it often because of the complexity of thought that had to be digested and the enormity of pervasive effort by accademia against; to dissolve the<br />obvious - that the complexity of life demands an incredibly loving and<br />incomprehensible Creator.<br /><br />Jim Hargett

B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"First I must tell the editor who wrote the review that I personally don't think any Latin guy who understands English will not laugh his guts out watching this. I was born in Cuba, and I am way beyond that ""politically correct cr@@p"". Although I would suggest one thing: next time any guy out there talks about us Cubans, please remember two things: 1) No, we DO NOT consume chili, jalapenos or whatever (that is a MEXICAN custom, not Cuban) and 2) We have no idea back in Cuba what a taco is. In fact, that for us, means a completely different thing; and a tortilla for us is an omelet, not some floury thing that, by the way, we again DO NOT know anything about back there. But then, enough of that, and let's give a huge round of applause for this guy. He is simply BRILLIANT. And for those of you Latin guys who go: ""Oh this is wrong, politically incorrect.."" I would say, get a freaking life!!!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Cars is a classic, and it's worth buying this gift set just for the enclosed die cast Lightning McQueen and Mater. I bought one of these gift sets and my son played with the cars so much, I was worried he'd lose them or damage the paint on them. So I bought another gift set to keep as a collectible. You can't buy this particular Mater anywhere, as far as I know, and it's got a very cool, metallic paint job (and isn't plastic-bodied like the ones in the stores).
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	There have been many good adaptations of comic book stories coming to theatres lately; it's truly a golden age for the super hero on the silver screen.  Iron Man is an enjoyable addition to this growing catalog of films, but it could have been truly outstanding with a few additions.<br /><br />The basic story is about a great industrialist who gets out of weapons manufacturing and into costumed heroism, having a change of heart after he spends some time imprisoned by warlords who have been acquiring his company's weapons.  This character turn had the potential to become preachy and obnoxious, but the movie wisely limits the peacenik blabbering to one minor character encountered early in the film.<br /><br />The movie underutilizes its two best assets: Tony Stark, and the suit.  Iron Man's combat suit is quite impressive, is equipped with a wide assortment of weapons, and seems to have enormous potential for elaborate action scenes.  Unfortunately, there is really only one scene in which we see him use the suit to its full capacity.  The film would have benefitted from one more big action sequence at that point in the story, or at least extending the scene we do have.  As for the man inside the suit, the character of Tony Stark is quite entertaining to watch when he's free to exchange verbal barbs with another character, or when he is let loose to adopt the larger-than-life billionaire playboy persona.  However, when he is constrained to trudge through plot-advancing dialogue, or when he has to share a more personal moment with another character, he seems to lose all his charm in an instant.<br /><br />But hey, if my biggest complaint is that I wanted more of a good thing, the movie must be doing alot of things right.  I solidly recommend it.<br /><br />PQ:<br />Blu-Ray picture quality was very good.  The only distracting digital noise I observed was when we see from a point-of-view inside the suit, which was clearly deliberate.  The daytime exterior shots are very nice, showing plenty of detail.  The dark, interior shots are not as impressive, but I've yet to see any movie on Blu-Ray that handled them perfectly.  Overall I would say the picture quality on the Blu-Ray is quite good, similar to (and maybe just a touch better than) Spiderman 3.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"We didn't think Jeff could do any better than ""Arguing with Myself"" until we saw ""Spark of Insanity."" I'm even more amazing at Jeff's creative genius. I have to admit my husband and I hadn't watched many ventriloquists before; however, after seeing Jeff's videos, we're definitely fans.<br /><br />We liked this video as much, if not more, than his first. I love the new ""Dead Terriost"" character. It's amazing how Jeff can make that so funny. Of course, my husband relates to Walter (he is Walter!) and we all love Peanut. When Peanut, Jeff, and Jalepeno on a Stick are all talking, you have to be amazed at Jeff's skill (and sense of humour).<br /><br />We have watched it with dozens of friends, each one saying the same thing. You soon forget he is working with puppets and he is making all the voices and sounds. There are even times when he and the puppets are talking at the same time! The puppets seem so real. It's amazing what he can say and get away with because it's coming out of their mouths. Sometimes his comments are controversial but he does it with such humour and no one is spared.<br /><br />My husband and I highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good laugh--a ""slap your knee, good belly laugh."""
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"When the TV ads for this film first popped up, I was telling friends that this was the first Scorcese film in YEARS that I was actually excited about seeing, and it was the same time as a De Palma film as well. But, since Brian and his film (""The Black Dahlia"") took such a beating for God knows what reasons unknown to any intelligent person, I took a 'political' stance and trashed Scorcese and his film, because I have felt for the past 12 years that Martin Scorcese is the most over hyped, over praised, overrated director in the industry; with people throwing roses at his films, while in the meantime they hate my favorite director Brian De Palma, and want to heave meat cleavers at his classic films. But I do love ""The Departed"" a lot more than I ever thought that I would.<br /><br />Yes, Martin Scorcese is the most overrated, overly hyped, highly praised director living today. And, for what? Well, I'll tell you: It's for his latest film, ""The Departed""! He did once make some really great films, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Color of Money"", ""Raging Bull"", ""The Last Waltz"", and ""Goodfellas"". But, that's been over 15 years ago. ""Casino"" was alright, but it was just an attempt at remaking ""Goodfellas"". And, films like ""Gangs of New York"", ""Bringing Out the Dead"", and ""The Aviator"" just didn't strike my fancy. His remake of ""Cape Fear"" was good, but nowhere near as great as he used to be.<br /><br />But, lo and behold, Marty has remade another film, ""Infernal Affairs"", and made himself a new classic that he deserved every accolade thrown his way for. He definitely deserved the Best Director award at the Academy Awards for this. For all of you people who praise Scorcese like he's God, well, I have to say you're right on this one. This is an extremely deep and profound and intense fast paced masterpiece of modern cinema that will leave you utterly breathless in practically every scene. And, it is rich with irony! Especially the plot of having, not one, but two moles, each one on a different side than the other.<br /><br />Brilliant storytelling at its best! I just didn't like that a certain character got killed in the end that should have lived, but that's not going to taint my judgement of this great film.<br />Scorcese is on fire here, making quick cuts left and right, entering scenes through a circle point of view, cutting back and forth between scenes and characters, past and present, and using an extremely terrific soundtrack to boost the film along like a freight train to H*ll. This kicks people like Tarantino back into Kindergarden!! This is possibly the best crime thriller genre film that I've seen in years.<br /><br />Everybody in the film is perfect for their roles, and their performances all shine through. This isn't near as gory as a lot of people make it out to be. It is violent, but no more so than any of Coppolla's ""Godfather"" films, and even less so than Scorcese's own ""Goodfellas"". Marty really out did himself with this one. Higly recommended! Thank you. :>)"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	True blood will not disappoint! I started watching the show but hadn't read any of the Sookie books. Then, when the show ended I was so distraught of having to wait all the way until Summer 2009 (geez!) to find out what happens next that I ordered the books and read them all in a week. Granted the books and show are not identical they are each equally great. I could see how book lovers would be slightly disappointed since it does veer off in its own interesting way but overall this show is addictive and will keep you wanting more. The casting and acting is top notch and of course so is Alan Ball. So glad that HBO will continue to Season 2 and hope they don't leave us high and dry like they did in Carniv&agrave;le and Rome.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Myself and my son are fans of this movie. We have a copy of it in DVD but when we saw in ammazon the blu-ray one we immediately bought it. The sound is really superb and to see it in blu-ray was really awesome. We watch it on weekends toghether and we love it.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"This is, perhaps, my favorite movie of any genre of all time. Since I have been a movie addict since I was a teenager many years ago, that is pretty strong stuff. I think the Pixar team outdid themselves on this movie, and I've loved every one they've released previously. The animation is fantastic (machines as people?), the scenery is breathtaking, the story and subplots are rich and well-done and the characters are believable and endearing. The storyline brings alive to the American public the way our desire to ""save ten minutes"" has essentially destroyed the towns and businesses along Route 66 at the same time destroying the values and innocence of a period in our recent history when family and neighbors were the strength of our nation. This is not a nostalgia piece so much as it is a wake-up call to what we have left behind in our cellphone/internet/instant-everything/lowest price/high tech/do-it-now society. The funniest scenes: tractor tipping and Mack making faces in the tank truck reflection."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Excellent.  Well worth the money, even if you've seen a version of the show on Comedy Central.  Dunham is consistently one of the best comedians around.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Another great Coen movie...right up there with my two personal favorites, Blood Simple, and Fargo.<br /><br />Depicts extreme violence in Texas and Mexico over drug money and an exchange gone bad.  Javier Bardem is chilling in his role as an unstoppable, amoral hunter in a relentless search for his drug money. No one is safe no matter the precaution they take to escape him.<br /><br />There is no grand finale in the expected sense...some things are left open.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"On the surface, this movie would appear to be an argument for Intelligent Design over Darwin's theory of Evolution.  It isn't.  It is more than that, much more.<br /><br />This is a movie about how our institutions of higher learning have packed faculties with people from the left - - most of whom accept liberal dogma (like the total and complete acceptance of Darwin's theory to the exclusion of all other notions) and are quite intolerant to consider alternative thought.  One would think this to be the antithesis of what higher learning is about - but Stein proves it otherwise.  Not endorsing Intelligent Design (ID), but using it as an example, Stein points out how alternative thought has been suppressed in colleges and universities in America.  And not just suppressed.  He talks to many who have been penalized for their views in the form of denied tenure, censorship and loss of employment.  Stein does this in frightening clarity through interviews with those who espouse ID as well as Darwin's theory of Evolution.<br /><br />This is a documentary that I highly recommend to people - - your favorite liberal friends as an example - - who worry about Church and State issues which look elimentary when compared to the threat of the ""only one view allowed"" that has infiltrated our institutions of higher learning.  Frightening, entertaining, educational.  Buy this video."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I have been a fan of Jeff Dunham for a long time. This DVD is the absolute best! From Sweet Daddy D to my favorite, Peanut.Jeff is the best! The uncensored version is hysterical! I have yet to watch the censored version. And the bloopers? A RIOT.A must have addition to your DVD collection!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I was originally debating purchasing all the Harry Potter movies on Blu-Ray until I read a review that said the graphics quality really only made a difference for movies 4 and later.  So I purchased 5 to check it out and was amazingly pleased.  Of all the Blu-Ray movies that I've purchased so far, the picture quality of this one has been the most impressive.  After this, I'm still planning on buying 4 on Blu-Ray but haven't made up my mind on which format to go with for 1-3.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	This was one of the worse movies I ever viewed ! No point to anything and a horrible ending that made me mad that I took the time to watch it ! I didn't even want to give it one star !
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	The quality is amazing and the extra/extended scenes are great to view. If you've seen Iron Man and enjoyed it, it makes sense to buy this over the DVD because the difference in picture quality is amazing.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	If you want to laugh this is the DVD to watch. My 20 year old and his friends laughed loudly during the entire show.
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	Jeff has created a new way to satirize life. His ventriloquist skills are phenomenal. He creates humor in every aspect of his performance.  To put it simply, he just makes the audience laugh.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	Insanity is difficult, but do the best you can and you'll get better over time.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Great movie - as good as The Prisoner of Azkaban, which is my favorite. It's a bit scary, particularly the death and fighting at the end. We're on the fence if we're going to let our 8-year-old see it. We'd like him to read the book first, to forewarn him of the suspense, action, etc. This strategy has really worked so far!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	All of us are well aware about the artistic trajectory of the Coen Brothers doen't obey to prefixed canons, somehow they represent for the American nation what Fassbinder for German, the voice of an ethic conscious.<br /><br />The graphic violence is just an excuse to get into the unsaid desperation of a handful of human beings who are living the golden ages, but told from a bitter perspective; the future of these people is full of clouds and uncertainness.<br /><br />Perhaps since the times of  midnight cowboy we had not witnessed a film burdened of so many questions without answers, a demolishing vision about the last stage of our life. A film that certainly will endure as one of the most nature and devastating among the great winners.<br /><br />Javier Bardem is terrific as the psychopath, who deliberately exterminates one by one (and specially to citizens of the third age) that may become an obstacle in his pursuit.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This DVD is absolutely hilarious! I laughed so hard I cried (three times in one weekend!). Highly recommendable for a good laugh!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"Robert Downey, Jr. absolutely rocks in this film. Say what you will about his repeat trips to rehab and his ""Hollywood Bad Boy"" persona, but this is an actor who was truly born to play the title role. You can see just how much he enjoys himself as the playboy rich kid Tony Stark riding in a tank in the middle of a war zone, enjoying a drink and joking with the soldiers. You can't help but wonder how many of the lines were adlibbed by Downey because the ease with which he delivers his lines is just too perfect. Gwyneth Paltrow is refreshing as Stark's assistant. While Paltrow has presented herself as a serious (dare I say pretentious?) actress in the past, she seems to relax and allow herself to enjoy the film. Her red hair helps to downplay her natural beauty allowing her to carry herself as a slightly mousy woman in comparison to the supermodels her boss usually brings home. Jeff Bridges, as always dominates the screen. He is a powerful actor and a diabolical baddie. I am impatiently awaiting the sequel!"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I love Jeff Dunham and this is a great party pleaser for adults who need a huge laugh - or forty.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	i thought it was excellent, it had great acting, awesome special effects, and the queen was completely and utterly perfect, i just watched it and am going to restart and watch it again, i thought it was a very dark and seductive remake of snow white that really had style
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I found this to be entertaining. It is a little violent at times, so I wouldn't recommend it to children, even though they have marketed it to them with a Zillion Toys! I liked it better than Fantastic 4 part 2, and Spiderman 2 and 3.
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	It's a fun watch - definitely for a mature adult audience.  But the books are better. And don't try to read to books AND watch this - they don't match up.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"This movie is so damn awesome! I watched it the other day and enjoyed every frieken minute of it. Whomever did the cinematography for ""Sin City"" should get an Oscar.<br /><br />Stylish, action packed, visually stunning, and loaded with a tremendous cast- this movie delivers the goods in every scene and is the only movie based on a comic that actually comes across as a ""live-action"" comic book.<br /><br />This is a fantastic film--although I'm not really sure I understood all the stories behind it (Ill just have to see it again); it doesnt really matter.<br /><br />Wonderful eye candy with awesome direction and cameos throughout!<br /><br />This is the most original movie I have seen all summer!! It is definitely a masterpiece of direction and photography!!<br /><br />SEE OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!"
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	The Deathly Hallows part 1 is by far the slowest, least fun packed Harry Potter movie made to date.  It's strange to have character developement in the second to last film of a series, but to their credit, the trio really stepped up to the job and gave us some top notch acting. So although, I'm glad they split the last book into two movies (part 2 should be AWESOME!), it made for a somewhat boring part 1. But let's face it...you still have to buy this DVD because IT'S HARRY POTTER and you can't break up the set.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This Jeff Dunham is amazing...I was rolling on the ground laughing.The laughter was non-stop, start to finish....
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This is absolutly hysterical.  If you want to laugh for 2 hours, get this DVD.  We love it at our house.
B001684L0A	3.0	b	I generally enjoyed the series. But as some have already mentioned here, the inexplicable tilting of the camera is a real annoyance. It is the major flaw in the series and adds nothing except the idea that Adams lived in a 'crazy' time, if that was even the intent. Like the old Batman series, where the Riddler's lare was on this perpetual tilt to depict the 'chaos'. Maybe that was the same idea. Who knows? A shoulder held camera would have been much more appropriate, giving the viewer the sense of 'being there'.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	Movie is worth owning.  Interesting story twist but even better cinema.  Beautiful costumes and sets.  I movie that doesn't seem like it wants to be in the trilogy race.
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	I thought the books were definately better. First series ok- hope the second series is better.
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	I purchased on black friday, (awesome deal by the way, thanks amazon!!!!) while I love True blood and Amazon has been always great to ship and deliver, I gotta say Shame on you HBO, my only complain is that they compressed the videos to fit them all on 5 dvd's. Chapters 1-2 are on the first disc, 3-4 one disc as well (so far so good), but chapters 5-6-7 are on a disc and 8-9-10 were compressed to a single disc as well, so it really looks like crap. Lastly, chapters 11-12 are on a disc so it is better than 3 chapters on one cd. This is why I give it 4 stars. So basically half the show looks like crap...But other than that nothing else to complain about... I mean at least I didn't pay the full $50 it cost other people....<br /><br />BTW I own the blu-ray season 2 of true blood and they did the same thing, while blu-ray is waaay better than dvd quality, you can see the picture quality is not that great on some blu-disc's, due to compression again, so know what you're getting into if purchasing these shows on dvd or blu-ray... Hopefully they'll change that for the upcoming season 3 discs...
B0006989TE	5.0	b	This movie, although poorly regarged by many is excellent.  It's story lulls the viewer into a sense of suspense that reigns throughout the picture.  It's brillantly filmed and it's actors are superb.  The ending will blow your mind pending you haven't already seen or heard about it from your friends.  For those with an open mind and a couple hours to spare I highly recommend joining the director and creator of Signs, etc. for a movie that goes against the grain of your typical suspense thirller.  Have Fun!!
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	What is there to say?  Love Harry Potter!  This one was probably hard to make, since the book was very convoluted story plot. Great Job!!
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	I just watched this a few days ago. There are plenty of reviews giving you all the details on why this is so bad. I will add just a little bit.<br /><br />This movie is neither original nor rational. The crew act without the least bit of common sense or reason. You figure on this kind of mission they would have some procedures. Not this gang who stumble along from one disastrous mistake to next. Maybe they should have watched Andromeda Strain before heading out. It might have taught them a bit about how to go about examining alien life forms. It has all the dumb things I have come to expect of big budget. There is special effect; people with attitude; the required chase; plenty of gore and of course the naked lady running in distress. In other words it is a very typical Hollywood movie.<br /><br />On the plus side it is not the absolute worst movie I have seen. Thanks to the non stop stream of garbage being produced it misses that. Therefore it gets a 2 and not a 1.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is awsome, I saw him in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and he is just a great comedian.  I plan to see him again in November of 2006.  My favorite puppet is Walter then Peanuut.
B002VRZEYM	1.0	b	Though the subject matter is important to learn about and the production quality is high I oppose the marketing of this film based on my recent interactions with the media rights company associated with Food, Inc.  The company is called Swank and neither they nor the film's website respond to email requests for permission to view this film.  When contacted by phone and told that we would like to show this film to some club members, (around 20), in the rear room of a nearby coffee shop our Agriculture Club was told that it would cost us $150 and require purchase of the film directly from their company.  For any organization that believes in what it is producing and is serious about the outreach associated with it, fees like this for films that are 4 years old is immoral and strikes me as individuals concerned more about profit than education.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001C08RHA"">Iron Man (Single-Disc Edition)</a><br />Very good movie!  It's a must have and we can't wait for the sequel!!!!"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	hubby was surprised and excited to get the 1st series... cant wait for the 2nd to be released...to surprise him again...
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	The movie was 4/5. I was disappointed that it had more of a story line than being just a funny animated car kid movie.
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	"The Movie CARS<br />I like the movie because it is funny and I like the fast cars, the pimped out cars I like are DJ, Boost, Snot rode, and Wingo. The funny cars I like are Mater because of all the stuff he says like when he is saying his name he says ""my name is mater like Tamater but without the Ta"". If Lightning would of got tires he would of won and would be the first ever rookie to win the Piston cup But when he's on the last turn he blows two tires. Then no one knows how won. And the King goes up to Lightning and said ""he's a gutsy racer but you're stupid"". Then the King says ""get you a good crew chief and then you will be good"". And then they say for the first time ever lightning says a rookie has won then he jumps through the paper. Then the announcer says there is a three way tie then on the way to California. DJ, WINGO, SNOT ROD, and BOOST started pushing Mac and Lightning falls out of the back of the truck. And he ends up in Radiator Springs. He was speeding and the Sheriff was going so fast Lightning thought that the Sheriff was shooting at him. So Lightning started going faster and when he got into the town he tour up the rode. So he had to fix the road with Beshy. And mater said ""I would give two lug nuts to be with Beshy. Then he went really fast and the road was a lot worse so he had to do it again and that time he finished it. Then he found out that the judge was the Hudson Hornet. And then he tells Mater that he won 4 Piston cups and then Mater says ""he did what in his cup"". Lightning makes the Hudson Hornet mad so he calls somebody and tells him where Lightning is. So he was racing and was losing bad but then he hears all the people from Radiator Springs. And then he starts to win and Chick makes The King crash so lightning goes and helps The King cross the finish line. Then the Dinoco  manger over and asks Lightning if he wants anything and he says yes and Mater gets to ride in a helicopter and Radiator springs is put back on the map. Its one of my favorite shows and I think other people my like it to so watch it."
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	The movie is fine.  Service was poor.  First the post office decided it could not deliver the package...the address was not correct (???).  I then canceled the order.  But Amazon sent a movie anyway.  ***Sigh***
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"good music, not ""just for kids"" although little ones are captivated by fast pace and color"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Way awesomely funny even if you don't know who he is!!  Great comic without being too dirty.  Highly recommended!!!!!!
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	I've been following Insanity to the dot. I followed the diet plan and did the workouts every day. I just finished the first week of the second month. I'm pretty active; ran marathons and was in good shape to start off. For the amount of time it takes to do the work outs I have not seen any results what so ever. I still weigh the same. I still look the same and I still do not see any abs. I'm still going to finish the program, just to be sure that I'm giving it the full 60 days;however, so far I have not seen any results.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"It isn't easy to make me laugh, but I tell you what Jeff Dunham is one funny guy! Most of my family members own his video now and we constatly quote him or one of his crazy characters ""SPARKLY""! I highly recommend this video"
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	3 Star Film. 1 Star if you've seen and are a fan of the Alien franchise. 5 Stars if you've never seen the Alien films.<br />Superb visuals. Acting was decent to very well, in my opinion. Story was my main issue. This is set in the Alien universe, years before the first film, but this creates the issues mostly due to problems with the production staff. Ridley Scott was trying to make a not too direct prequel to Alien. However, the head writer, Damon Lindelof, was trying to expand the universe with whole new characters and a whole new franchise that wouldn't go anywhere near Aliens and Ellen Ripley. Basically a spinoff franchise. You combine these two visions and you get Prometheus. A disappointment for Alien fans (as I will discuss below) and a decent sci-fi film for those who have never seen Alien and its sequels. I will go on to say, however, whether an Alien fan or a new viewer, this film does have an ominous ending leaving old and new questions unanswered on purpose for hopes of a definite sequel.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD.<br /><br />This was a complicated movie as it raised hopes for those of us who have seen the Alien franchise and eager to see this supposed prequel to explain the origins of the Alien. However, it didn't quite do that. As my post title says, this movie created more questions than it answered. This movie goes off in a tangent explaining supposedly who/what created the aliens and mankind itself, but there are just too many problems. First off, it doesn't really tell us where the Alien came from. Supposedly, some say the Engineers made them, indirectly, as some sort of biological weapon. Indirectly because if the engineers ingest the black spore liquid, they literally start dissolving. Other creatures are mutated into killing machines, such as the worms or maggots in the room with the Giant head turning into the snake like hammerpedes, or the geologist turning into some sort of hills have eyes super strong punk monster. Holloway, however, only had a very low dose of the black spore liquid so it was slowly killing him and mutating him. His mutated sperm was somehow able to impregnate a sterile woman, with what turns out to be some sort of facehugger, which attachs to an engineer and has some sort of xenomorph pop out of his chest, possibly an ancestral precursor to the familiar aliens as it does not fully have all their characteristics. This would make some sense if it wasn't for the plot hole of the biologist and the geologist looking at a mural in the room with the giant head of what is obviously an Alien that looks exactly like the ones from the original films. Why would the Engineers have a mural of the familiar Alien if it has never been encountered before (if you follow the process the movie has that I outlined above)? And why would they have a mural of it anyway, like it's some sort of god to them or something? Scott says if they make a sequel and it is successful, its successor (a third movie) would be the direct link between these new movies and the original Alien. Unless Lindelof is involved. He says if Scott and the studios want to work with him, they have to move the new franchise away from the old. I think this guy trying to sabotage the Alien prequel is more intense than the entire movie. I hope Ridley Scott and James Cameron get beck to trying to make a fifth Alien movie with each other. That would have to be great.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"As I've been involved in the Amazon.com comments threads for the Expelled dvd, here is my own review for the film on Amazon.co.uk, originally posted on 31.1.10:<br /><br />As a Bible-believing Christian, it is fascinating to hear that there are scientists out there, who don't even have a Christian agenda, who have a major problem with Darwinian evolution. It is a theory in crisis, and it is only a matter of time before the ""Berlin Wall"" comes tumbling down!<br /><br />My wife and I recently visited Auschwitz, and we made the same connection that Stein does. It is very hard to not see what took place there as Darwin's theory put into practice. Was Hitler not a consistent evolutionist?<br /><br />Ben Stein's documentary is brilliantly made, with good humour amidst the serious subject matter. Scientists from various perspectives are interviewed. Stein's interview with Richard Dawkins is particularly revealing, especially concerning a very candid admission on his part.<br /><br />What never ceases to amaze me is the idea that teaching our children that God created the heavens and the earth is indoctrination, but somehow to teach them that they came from apes is not. The scene where Stein walked through the Natural History Museum brought it home to me just what indoctrination really is.<br /><br />But the main message of this documentary is to say that we should have the debate, make the case, engage in dialogue...<br /><br />What are the evolutionists afraid of??<br /><br />ADDITIONAL COMMENT:<br /><br />Lest anyone question whether Hitler was a consistent evolutionist, here is a quote from the man himself...<br /><br />""If nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with stronger, she wishes even less that a superior race should intermingle with an inferior one; because in such a case all her efforts, throughout hundreds of thousands of years, to establish an evolutionary higher stage of being, may thus be rendered futile."" (Mein Kampf, Hurst & Blackett, 1939, pg 239-40)"
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	I love all Pixar movies. This one is similarly great. The visuals are gorgeous on Bluray, and the story is very entertaining. I just felt that the middle part of the story was a tad slow perhaps, given how much adrenaline there was in the beginning of the movie.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	A freind loaned us the DVD and we laughed so hard we both had tears pouring out of our eyes. We bought the DVD and played it for some family members last night and we ALL were laughing uncontrolably. We are looking so forward to the September 18th release of the new DVD. HIGHLY RECOMENDED! You will NOT be disapointed.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I got this for my son -in -law and he absolutely Loves it!!!!!!Couldn't have came quicker in the mail either.
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	"Amazon asks us ""Do we love,like,feel okay,dislike or hate "" a film.They are ALL subjective terms.It leaves room for personal taste and interpretation.So,this will be a very tough and,I am sure,unpopular OPINION of mine,but here goes...<br /><br />I thoroughly disliked this film.The story offered nothing to me.I did not find it at all interesting.I did not care for any character.I found them all to be lacking in every sense of human dignity.I found the killing numbing.This film made me feel like Anton-cold and lifeless inside.I did not find it suspenseful.Each murder made me feel as though,"" Oh well,just another day at the office!""I really just wanted the film to end.The slow moving and exacting pace of the film was not to my liking,especially without any viable soundtrack.The film was very devoid of colors other than the browns and tans of desert and paneled motel rooms.The film had little dialogue.I did not like FARGO,so I suppose that the Coen Brothers are just not my style...but I can understand other people liking their films.<br /><br />What I did like was the way in which the film was cleverly cut in order to show the movements of Brolin,Bardem and Jones.It allowed the story to see all of the actions going on in each character.Still...not enough to hold my interest.<br /><br />There was one continuity error that glared at me which was The Regal Motel offered ""Free HBO"" on it's sign.Nope....not in 1980 it didn't.Check your facts.<br /><br />Javier Bardem was the only reason that I went to see this film.I love his work.Not even he could save it for me.It was fun to see Scottish actress Kelly Mac Donald play a Texas wife.That was unique.I'll be in the minority on this one.Here come the ""not helpful votes""....Ahhhhhhhhhhhh....."
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	Little slow at the start (opening monologue, no characters), but great after that.  Laughed so hard the first time I watched it, thought I was going to choke on my drink.  Easily one of my top 5 all-time for funniest stand-up comedy show.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This was even more funny than Spark of insanity. Hard to believe. I laughed out loud, and all that we show the show to fall off their seat laughing.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This entire show is hilarious, especially if you can laugh at yourself. Jeff Dunham finds many quirky traits and roaring human emotions to share with you through his puppet characters. We don't know of anyone who has not laughed out loud while watching this!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I am LOVING this work out and I am SEEING results. Stick to the meal plan and stretch often and you will be loving it and seeing results too!
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	"With it's pioneering visuals, there is no doubt this movie is quite simply gorgeous to look at. It's plot isn't terrible, with three basic story lines that draw you in as much as the character's narrations of their situations. A bonus to this orginal film is the easy-on-the-ears dialogue; there's a relatively small amount of profanity for an R-rated film.<br /><br />But, it seems all good things have their downsides. As word truthfully has it, ""Sin City"" is a very graphically violent movie, reminescent of guest director Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" volumes. The film is riddled with nudity, pedophilia, strippers and creepy prositutes, and let us not forget cannibalism. Mixed messages also plague the screen (tinted with a bit of tongue-in-cheek humor), telling us (once again) that personal revenge is sweet, and it's okay to get it by whatever means, especially by grotesquely killing like no tomorrow.<br /><br />This film has only a couple of positives (not benefits, mind you), which can never be worth that sinking feeling you have after watching it, if you have any moral conscience at all.<br /><br />(pluggedinonline.org used as additional reference)"
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	i am very disappointed in HBO in coming out with a series about vampires. from the preview that i watched on amazon.com, i honestly wouldn't waste my money and time with this series.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	True Blood is the only series that I've ever liked enough to buy on DVD. I was worried that it wouldn't be worth it, because I wouldn't watch it more than once. I was wrong. I love being able to watch my favorite episodes over and over. I will definitely be buying all the seasons.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	Great movie, enjoyed teh story which was backed up by great sound effects. When watching it at home with the home movie system, it almost took the pictures off the wall. Robert Downie Jr's best movie since Chaplin, just shows what a good script can do for your career. Gwyneth Paltrow played her role as the female butler exceptionally well.  Movie ends with the it set up for a sequal.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with this movie
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I bought this for myself and all of my friends LOVED IT!!! If you have not seen it you are really missing out!! Jeff Dunham is such an amazing actor, you really feel like the puppet is talking!<br />If you are looking for something to give someone that likes to laugh this is the gift!!!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This is an incredible entertainment but what really sets it apart is that showcases technology that will someday be possible.  There are companies right now [name deleted]  that are working on systems that extend human ability beyond what our bones and muscle are designed to do.  Soldiers in the future (or superheroes)  will be able to lift hundreds of lbs. and run at superhuman speeds.  Will they fly?  This movie shows us that it's possible !!<br /><br />Get your kids and your friends interested in math, science and technology.  You won't believe the places it will take you.  Whether flying in a suit or flying beyond our own planet (Iron Man 2?)  the sky is the limit.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"The movie I ordered was not good quality. Hugo's did everything in its power to make the order right. I was offered and recieved a free copy and given a refund for my unsatisfactory product. All this was done in a polite, ""aim-to-please"" manner which I greatly value. I'd recommend this company for it's quality assurance and cusomer satisfaction."
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	"The first thing I am going to say is had I seen this movie in the theater I would have been pissed. I think that Chris Hemsworth's and Charlize Theron are two very talented actors( the only reason I did not give it one star), but would somebody please tell me why Kristen Stewart gets millions for doing movies. If sucking in your breath and popping a tear out of your eye and mumbling your lines is all that is required then I qualify to be an actress. I started watching and Snow White as a little girl was alright. Then cut to the grown-up and yuck. As long as she does not talk it is better. Frankly, I could not wait for Chris Hemsworth to show up on screen, and as far as I am concerned he did not show up fast enough. The one funny line has The Huntsman cutting away her dress and she looks at him like she thinks he is going to ravage her. He looks at her and says "" don't flatter yourself"". That sums up just about everything about her. Watching them plod through the forest is torture.  The actors who play the dwarves are hilarious, they steal the movie. The scene where the two male leads talk about the inner light of Snow White and how you have to be blind not to see it, made me wonder if they got through that without gagging. To be blunt the most exciting thing about the movie was finding out she was not so snowy white and was sleeping with the director. I saw they were planning a sequel and I would like to know what for? I do believe they are plotting a spin-off for the huntsman, and if Chris Hemsworth is doing it I will be the first in line. Just not more of this same drivel. I would have to be as drunk as the huntsman to see that."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Arguing With Myself brought tears to my eyes. It takes a lot to make me laugh.  I caught one of Jeff's shows over some time ago and I would tell everyone I knew...There's this guy, this ventriloquist...jalipeno....on a stick...You just have to get this DVD.  Without Walter, Peanut, & Jose, the stand up is great, throw in the whitty crotchety old man, the multi-lingual receding hairline alien, the super-excitable red neck, the smooth jive talkin pimp daddy, and the vegetable on a stick and this show is unbeatable!!!
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	i tried this for the first week aware of the knee issue other people were having being very cautious landing softly...i felt some discomfort but i was still able to do the work outs...i modified a few exercises but in the middle of the second week my right knee started to hurt and had a popping sound so i stopped even thou i can still do the work out and have no problems going up the stairs i dont think its worth risking it...maybe i'll give it a week and start doing this every other day...its weird i feel slimmer in my waist but havent lost any weight i was getting happy cuz i like being at 175 being 5'8... i still dont think this work out is worth the price thou and they should know the knee shouldnt go thru those workouts everyday....even recovery week i saw didnt seem to be much of a break....i did plyometrics from p90x and even added a 20 pound jacket and weighted 190 and didnt have this issue...
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Everyday that there is a reason to cry I put in my spark dvd & do just that laugh till i cry. This dude is fantastick on a stick!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Watched it twice on a row, Mickey rourke was surprisingly awsome, this movie is defenately a come back for this great 80's actor.<br /><br />The direction was so genious.<br /><br />I do recommend it to all ages.<br /><br />Great superb cast as well.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Love it!!!  But I am a Harry Potter Junkie....  I have read all of the books several times and own all of the movies....
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Again, I had the original - but, because the price was right, I upgraded to the blu-ray and gave the older one to my son.  Fantastic colors, amazing technology and a wonderful story line.  I think it will keep the spirit of Christmas alive in children.  This is NOT a political statement folks - but, let's face it, the real meaning of Christmas is being washed away by certain people who have an agenda.  We can stop them if wew choose.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Eye opening movie that everyone in America should see.  It has changed the way I eat and buy food!
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	Item shipped as stated but wish it could have been faster. Good transaction.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	My grandson and the rest of the family found ourselves not being able to pull ourselves away from watching this movie over and over.Great buy and fast shipping.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I really wanted something that was high cardio and this is it.  It's challenging, but not impossible and I can really see a difference in the inches that have melted off my body in just the first two weeks. I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind taking their time to get stronger and getting comfortable with the energy it takes to do the routine. The nutrition plan is great too in that you can choose your menu for the week and it's normal food, you know, nothing with super special ingredients that you have to spend a fortune on.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	The Blu-Ray is good quality! I really enjoyed Season 1 and will purchase Season 2. The Sookie Stackhouse novels by Charlaine Harris are what got me into True Blood.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	I just want to make it clear that I love the movie.  I have a few quibbles with the script, but nothing that serious. {Like how did Obie manage to control that giant power suit so well when he had no time to practice his Ironman Kung-Fu?}<br /><br />My real quibble is with the Blu-ray transfer team.  They did not implement DTS-HD Master Audio, which is the top-flight audio standard Blu-Ray offers.  They should have used DTS-HD MA.  Also, there is some softness and grainy noise in the picture occasionally.  I found this very surprising.  Certainly, a movie just released this summer cannot have had time to degrade on a media shelf somewhere in North Hollywood.  Certainly, such a recent master must have had many purely digital elements.  Certainly, they should have been able to avoid some of the problems associated with film transfer?<br /><br />I am afraid Paramount is still figuring out Blu-Ray after having been entrenched in the HD-DVD camp.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Great movie! Yes, Kristen is all doe-eyed and such but, the movie has so much more. Just watch it if you love the period age.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	kids of all ages will love it.  Don't forget to watch the credits.  They are a hoot with the outtakes.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Polar Express is a wonderful movie! My grandson who is 3 yrs. old loves it! I got 2 of them and sent one to him, along with a bell. He loved that!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I have seen Jeff Dunham many times on comedy central over the years, but when I found out he finally Made this DVD, and is now on a full blown tour, it is great to know he is finally being recognized.  I remember him, walter and peanut years ago, and his routine is just so polished now, it's time more people know.  Great timing, and crowd interaction, this is the way comedy should be delivered. This does have some swearing in it, and it's not one that kids should watch.  Just because they are puppets, the content is not for them.  Overall, well done, a must own!!!
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	Visually very good; great special effects.  That's it.  Not the fault of the actors either.  It moved very slowly, was boring, characters were boring and it felt as though it dragged on and on.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"John Adams: deeply principaled, no-nonsence, ornery, lawful good, brilliant, fallible, passionate founder of our country.  This is the story of the unbridled defiance, the shrewd intellect, and the angry pounding fist that tore the American colonies from British rule and gave birth to one of the greatest experiments in the history of the world - the United States of America.  Stunning and haunting, this is John Adams like you've never seen him.  Myth and poetry have been stripped away to reveal the far-more-fascinating, truly-human story of one of the greatest men who has ever lived.<br /><br />Giamatti is simply brilliant as Adams.  If he doesn't win the Emmy for this, I may declare my own independance from the ""dark tyranny"" of the ATAS.  Linney is equally wonderful in her portrayal as the groundingly sapient Abigail.  Their love story is one of the greatest in American history, and it's been marvelously recaptured here.<br /><br />If it's even possible to have ""spoilers"" for a factual historical drama, then the following might qualify, but if you want to see what each eposide covers, here's my stab at it:<br /><br />Episode 1: Join or Die.<br />Begins with the Boston Massacre, and covers the period leading up to Adams departure for Philidelphia to represent Massachusettes in the First Continental Congress.<br /><br />Episode 2: Independance.<br />Covers the First Continental Congress, the beginning of the American Revolution at Lexington and Concord, the nomination of GW (by Adams) to serve as general of the new Continental Army, the Second Continental Congress, and Adams collaboration with Jefferson and Franklin to bring forth the Declaration of Independance.<br /><br />Episode 3: Don't Tread on Me.<br />Covers the journey of Adams and Franklin to France to secure support against the British, Adam's tone-deaf approach to French diplomacy, his painful separation from Abigail, his dispatch to Holland (where his approach is somewhat better receive), and a terrible illness that befalls him.<br /><br />Episode 4: Reunion.<br />Covers the defeat of the British forces, Adam's return to Paris and reunion with Abigail, his appointment to represent the new nation to the English crown, his frustrating absence from the Constitutional Convention, his return to America, and his election as Vice President.<br /><br />Episode 5: Unite or Die.<br />Covers Adam's Vice Presidency under George Washington, the ongoing British and French conflict, his strained relationship with Jefferson over their very different ideas about how the new nation should be governed, and his narrow victory over Jefferson to become the second President.<br /><br />Episode 6: Unnecessary War.<br />Covers Adam's uneasy presidency, including the retention of Washington's cabinet, largely controlled by Hamilton (mistake #1), the imfamous Alien and Sedition Acts (mistake #2), his arrival at the White House in the new capital of Washington (both still under construction), his estragement from his son Charles, the XYZ affair, his successful prevention of war with France, his loss of the Presidency to Jefferson, and his somber return to Massachusettes.<br /><br />Episode 7: Peacefield.<br />Covers Adam's post-presidency, including the death of daugher Nabby, followed by Abigail, his reconciliation with Jefferson, the election of John Quincy as President, his long and introspective reflections on his life and legacy, and his death on the same day as Jefferson - the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration which they masterminded together.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this rare masterpiece as much as I did.  I watched every episode as they aired, and plan to watch them all again as soon as the DVD is available.  This is television at its finest, and I give it my highest recommendation."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"With each decade, the dark heart of Comic Book Adaptations beats a little faster. Ever since Tim Burton made his version of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8"">Batman</a>, super-heroes have made our nights in the theater all the more exciting and thought provoking. Now, with Marvel Comics' taking the studio reigns on ""Iron Man,"" they've done something totally new. ""Iron Man"" is the rare comic book movie that stands apart from its origins, a movie that could have been made without a back-mythology, and a film you can go see without previously knowing anything about the source material.<br /><br />A great deal of this has to do with the casting. Robert Downey Jr, as billionaire Tony Stark, brings enough snarky humor to his conflicted billionaire playboy genius that you totally fall for the act. As his rival Obadiah Stane, Jeff Bridges obviously relishes getting to play baddie. He's all oily charm and malevolence, and watching is descent into the Iron Monger is a marvel (pun intended). Speaking of Iron Monger, the suits, oh the suits. When Tony Stark perfects the second Iron Man outfit (with the help of his AI companions), it really will make you believe he can fly. Even with the CGI, the suits look realistic and hot.<br /><br />The suits do battle and it's better than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VR0570"">Transformers</a> fights (which were both done by the same company). The other ""training exercise"" shots, like the one with the fighter planes, are pulse-racing fun. The gadgets are worthy of a Bond Film, and the humor that slides in helps give the movie balance. (Like Stark's commentary to his robots during suit tests, for example.)<br /><br />Balance is also achieved by the rest of the cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as the loyal Pepper Potts and Leslie Bibb as reporter Christine Everhart. Terrence Howard (who is underused) plays Stark's best friend Jim Rhoades. Stan Lee makes the obligatory cameo, and the assorted bad guys are, well, the current middle eastern terrorists du-jour. (It is worth noting that the ultimate evil-doer here is not a foreigner...)<br /><br />All in all, a great Good Vs Evil night at the movies, down to the Black Sabbath finally popping up in the credits. And was it me, or did the end credits pay homage to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OCMR"">Tron</a>, a movie Jeff Brides just happen to be in?  I also have to - as everyone else here has stated - remind everyone: stay through the credits. ""Iron Man"" kicks the summer blockbuster season off with a bang."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"I enjoyed this miniseries so much that I just had to buy it.  I have since shared it with the rest of my family, and the response is always the same: Amazing attention to detail, and captivating from start to finish.  It pulls you back in time, and you can almost imagine yourself back when our country was struggling to free itself from the yoke of England's Monarchy. It was such a turbulent time to live, when the peoples' desire to be independent could have led to charges of treason against the Crown, and their deaths by hanging.<br /><br />We are given insight to how the Congress was formed, and how it worked. The election of the President and Vice-President was quite interesting in how it was accomplished.... so much less complicated than what we have today! Politics in general hasn't changed much, though....<br /><br />The producers have gone to great lengths to make the sets as close as possible to the actual places they are portraying. The actors have been transformed to what we today acccept as how these historical figures actually looked. If you want more detail, you can switch on the program that gives facts about the times, the people, the places, the customs, etc... as the movie plays. It is similar to what the miniseries ""ROME"" offered, and gives so much more information than from just watching the movie. There are also subtitles for those that need them.<br /><br />The performances of Paul Giamatti, Laura Linney, Stephen Dillane, and the rest of the cast, are top notch. Without the chemistry they project on screen, it could have been just another mediocre historical movie.  But they bring these historical figures to life, making them unforgettable!<br /><br />I recommend this DVD set to anyone who loves history, or to anyone who wants to learn a little more of how our country was back in its infancy.<br />It is truly worth the price, which, I might add, Amazon.com beat every place else, hands down!"
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Nice Item of course it was new.  Shipping was speedy especially around the holidays.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I don't buy as many DVD's anymore.  But, this one's a keeper.  It's full of action and just plain fun!
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Good plot,fabulous costume designs. The movie was left open to interpretation as to if or when there will be a sequel.Relationships were left dangling. Would like to see the plot finished in a sequel.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"This movie is very action filled and I couldn't wait to watch it.  It includes the awesome epic battle between lord voldemort(you know who) and HARRY POTTER.  It is so amazing.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UG542S"">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2</a>"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"If you appreciate good comedy this is the show to watch. We watched Jeff and his ""family"" on Comedy Central twice and right after watching him I went on Amazon and ordered the DVD. We have watched the DVD at least 3 times since we purchased it. There is a word of caution though, the unbleeped version can be a little bit much for the younger members of the family. The bleeped version is still pretty much a PG-13 or PG rating and it is not recommended for young children. Jeff and his family of characters will have you crying from laughing so hard that it makes your sides hurt and you can't breathe. Watch for ""Jose Jalapeno on a steeek"" and ""Peanut"" who puts him in the vegetable steamer instead of taking him to the spa. Absolutely the funniest I have ever seen!!!"
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"In summers that are now filled with super heroes vying for cinematic dollars, Iron Man climbs to the top of the mountain, with the human side of the story not being overwhelmed by high-tech gadgetry.<br /><br />With a neat twist to the comic book top gun, Robert Downey Jr. portrays industrialist Tony Stark, who creates the power armor that ultimately becomes the Iron Man power suit while being held captive by terrorists. Stark is assisted in the task by the ill-fated captive Dr. Yinsen (Shaun Toub). The plot then takes a roller-coaster ride of betrayal, redemption and avenging the death of his fellow captive, while building up to something called the ""Avenger Initiative"".<br /><br />This character may become a surprising franchise in the crowded marketplace of super heroes in the contemporary settings of war and politics. The 2-disc Blu-ray edition is an outstanding way to start on the adventure or to see it again....for the very first time."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	My husband and I just saw Jeff's show this past Saturday in Mass. It was fantastic! Achmed the Dead Terrorist is hysterical! He goes right to the edge with a politically sensitive subject. And, of course, Walter, Peanut, and Jose are just as great as ever. We have his first DVD and are always showing it to people who haven't been indoctrinated. No matter how many times we see it, we laugh just as hard as the first time. We are looking forward to this new DVD to have in our house when we need a Jeff 'fix'.
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	The info for this product is misleading. It seems like this is the only option for blu-ray, DVD and digital copy but digital copy for the brand new copy of this movie was expired before we even made our purchase. If you are looking for a digital copy this is not the way to go.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This is a fantastic DVD for kids from 3 to 93 and beyond. I loved it & you will too.
B001684L0A	4.0	b	I really did enjoy viewing John Adams.  I also have been reading the book by David McCullough and the movie is accurate from that point of view.  The movie brings out just how important John Adams was to the formation of this United States from its inception.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	If you haven't seen it on TV and you like vampires this is a must have.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	We have a two year old son, who loves this movie. We must have watched it at least 30 times during the holiday season.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I am a scientist (molecular biology), but by nature experiment in many areas of day to day life.  In this experiment I took my older wide screen DVD of the order of the Phoenix and watched it on my Samsung player, with new surround sound bar.  Next I took my just arrived Blu-ray of the same title and watched it.  The results show The Blu-ray was far superior in both audio and Vidio.  I chose this title for the experiment because you can watch it twice without falling asleep.  The special effects are excellrnt. So I highly recommend this title in Blu-ray.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"The Bottom Line: Go see CARS!!! Pixar gathered all of the best parts of any its films and jammed them into one great film with the best animation, memorable characters, non-stop action, and heart that defines Pixar films. Go see CARS!!!<br /><br />I will admit it. I think I am THE world's greatest Pixar fan. I grew up with Pixar. Pixar fostered my early childhood all the way to my teenage years. I know everything about Pixar. Some would even call me obsessed. From each short, to the inside jokes, and to all of the great characters; I've memorized all the best one liners to all of Pixar's films. I've watched each one of the films a million times. I am the best!<br /><br />Which is exactly what Lightning McQueen, the racecar who thinks he's all that, thinks. After he races in the huge Piston Cup race, but ends up in a three-way tie, Lightning McQueen believes that he will win that Piston Cup. But like all great films, he confronts a problem, getting lost in the town of Radiator Springs and slowly realizing that the Piston Cup is only ""an empty cup.""<br /><br />It is at Radiator Springs where Lightning learns the importance that it's not about the prize at the end, but the journey that one takes to get to the prize. Cars is a movie about how Route 66 was almost forgotten by the construction of the interstate. It's about knowing that judging others is not the best thing. It's about how people can get away from the rush of city life and enjoy the small town life. Best of all, it is a movie that everybody can enjoy.<br /><br />The audience cried, they cheered, and they laughed for the characters on screen, because they cared for these characters. At two hours long, Cars is the longest Pixar film so far, but that's too short. Because Cars spends about a quarter of the movie developing the characters, some may say that the film almost stops and doesn't get anywhere, until it speeds up again. Lightning must fix the road that he broke. Along the way, he goes tractor tipping with Mater the tow truck, cruising with Sally the porshe, and competing with Doc Hudson the Hudson Hornet. During the ""Our Town"" sequence, I could feel a tear down my cheek and the Pixar folks tugged at my heartstrings. The finale sequence is probably the best finale sequence that Pixar has ever made. Each character introduced has a purpose in the film, and doesn't exist just as an ensemble.<br /><br />On top of the excellent story, Cars has the best animation, traditional or computer generated, that Pixar films are known for. The vistas look surprisingly real and detailed, especially on the big screen. The reflections, the lighting, and the shading in the characters make the characters realistically stand out from the background. The filmmakers did an excellent job visually making the viewers believe that these cars are living and breathing, having human-like qualities. Each shot of the film is a piece of art, with so much happening on the screen at one point at a time that one only wonders how Pixar did it.<br /><br />Since Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters, Inc, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, Pixar put one instant classic after another, creating and living up to the standard for the future of classic films. And guess what? Pixar has done it again. As a piece of fast-speed and high-quality entertainment, Pixar's Cars is the best fun you'll have all year. You're in for one hell of a ride.<br /><br />(Here's a little secret for you: Look out for all of the Pixar inside jokes scattered throughout the movie. There's the jackalope from ""Boundin'"" on a trailer, the birds from ""For The Birds"" on a telephone pole, the Pizza Planet Truck behind the announcers, and if you stay to the very, very end of the credits, you'll get a surprise from the Pixar folks.)"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Great flick! Amazing life changes & people helping others. Awareness & helplessness, sad, uplifting, and mostly life changing. I purchased a juicer & love it!
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	"...for making imaginative, high quality, and family fun entertainment that we're used to viewing.<br /><br />I was ten years old when ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" was first released and I was blown away. What a thrill it is to enjoy a fresh, new Indiana Jones movie all these years later.<br /><br />In ""Indiana Jones & The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull"", Harrison Ford plays a gracefully aged Indy with stern confidence and wisdom of the years. What more can we expect from such a colorful character of fantasy that has had so many incredible adventures. Once again, Indy teams up with loyal friends as they search for the Crystal Skull and it's meaning while being pursued by a solid pack of villains.<br /><br />The quality of this movie is FAR better than what the rude and 'hating' trolls make this out to be. Indeed, many of the comments concerning the dislike of this movie are ridiculous, despicable, and disgusting all at the same time. Truly an indicator of the infestation of the low class 'simpletons' on the internet. Beware the masses!<br /><br />Top notch set design, state of the art special effects, and a unique story let ""Crystal Skull"" stand on it's own merits apart from the previous films in the series. Not to mention the action and the wonderful perfomances of Ford, Shia, and especially Cate Blanchet whom I thought was gorgeous in the role of Spalko.<br /><br />The cinematography is a joy to behold that convincingly sets the story in that bygone era of the 1950's. Along with the set desgin and the theme of the film, it truly does harken back to the films from that era as well. John Williams' even touches on some of the weird tones in those '50's  sci fi films thoughout the score.<br /><br />The movie culminates in an absolutely fantastic climax that far surpasses the 'ho hum' ending to ""The Last Crusade"". For me, ""Crystal Skull"" ranks better than Indy 3. And bring on Indy 5, but PLEASE, no more religious artifacts.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	"I am not going to review this film, because if you like the Coen brothers you're going to buy it anyway.  I enjoyed a vast majority of this film, but I never thought the Coen brothers would have something in common with Robert Rodriguez.  The end brought back flashes of my frustration with the film ""Desperado"".  Passing up on an action scene, in a film like this, is like drinking Miller High Life with your steak.  I have only one thing left to say - COENs!!!!!!"
B00447G29S	4.0	b	My family and I watch this movie every holiday season with our guests. Usually around Thanksgiving, but always at Christmas. It is for sure, a classic! The story is sweet, the visuals are stunning, the musical score is delightful. This is one to own. Or at least to rent every year during the holidays!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Great deal, I received my blue ray, DVD, and I also was able to download de digital copy, it was expired, but I decided to try to download anyway, and you know what? Warner extended from September 2011 to September 2012<br />I would recommend everyone that bought it, and have the code expired to try like I did.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	Movie was exciting, with lots of adventure. I really like the way the told the story and Charlize Theron was amazing as the evil queen.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Some of the reviewers here downplay this movie as if they went into it expecting to actually find the eternal secrets of the universe. Indiana Jones is the modern rendition of a fifties action serial. This means half the fun is the pulp writing, two notches above the script for a good Saturday Morning Cartoon. This is what makes me happy to see a new Indy flick, whats wrong here? Whats wrong is that some people think to much. Relax. Indy can't die. He drank from the cup of Christ in 1938, remember? So, getting blasted down the side of a rock, with insane speed and impact, inside of a refrigerator, won't harm the man much.<br />Next, just because he is old, doesn't mean that our man doesn't know how to say the right thing all the time, or know exactly what to do at every given situation, or fight. What is he, like 80? Sometimes you just gotta make it up as you go along...<br />There is no way that you can make a Hollywood movie these days the same way they made them in the eighties. I've seen Raiders on the big screen at several midnight matinees in the last few years. It looks pretty damned fake for the most part, but I don't care much, because the action is solid, and Indiana Jones is still the man. I don't like CGI at all myself, but I hardly noticed it in this movie. Except the monkeys. They did almost look like they were gonna bust out micrphones and start singing like disney cartoons. But that scene lasted two seconds, and yet how many people can't seem to get over it?<br />Cate Blanchett. Maybe her character is a bit like every other Russian female villain you've ever encountered, just short of being named Natasha, but I thought she was cool. Psychic powers too, nice touch.<br />Shia Le-whats his face wasn't so bad either. Sigh of relief from me, I expected the worst, seeing as how I read a few reviews comparing him to Jar Jar Binks. Ouch. It CANT be THAT bad! He wasn't that bad. He was arright. Combing his hair back every two seconds, playing with his pocket knife. He's not gonna be the next Indiana Jones, as is clearly stated by the end, but he makes a pretty good Short-Round replacement for Team Indy. Plus he can fence, and ride motorcycles.<br />Marion Ravenwood could still kick your a$$...<br />This is the supporting cast. Indiana Jones is your man. The rest of the crew fall into place nicely as our newest adventure unfolds. There may or may not be aliens, we are never really entirely sure what we see at the end. But apparently if you really do ingest all of the eternal secrets of the universe, your face will melt and you will be burned into particle dust.<br />MAN, I TOTALLY DIG INDIANA JONES MOVIES!!!!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	who didn't know PIXAR. Cars makes car looks live with a lot of mimic . with gift set 2 cars figure. Transfer movie 5/5 audio 5/5 and 4/5 feature. Love it .. buy it if you liked
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	Now, I am not a Harry Potter fan at all. I went to this movie because my fianc&eacute;e wanted to but thats not to say that this movie was not good. In fact it was great, from a movie stand point. No problems to speak of the CGI was well done and they do a great job of pulling you into this world. The acting in these movies has gotten a lot better. Over all I was entertained, which is the goal of the movie. I think that this movie series has come a long way and is getting better with each one.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"Thanks to a great cast of actors ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1"" was quite spectacular !<br />  The movie starred Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, who can be thanked for the bone chilling performance ( that made me regret not shutting my eyes at times ) and deserves credit for making the Deathly Hallows seem even more ""deathly"" !<br /><br />  The tension never really seems to go away in this movie with special effects that will leave you in awe, breathtaking excitment and action, along with purely deep ""heart in their mouth"" emotion that the characters were able to produce.<br /><br />Another thing that surpised me about this movie is how they managed to actually put in a lot of amusing scenes !<br /><br /> It was also nice to see alot of familiar faces as  well !<br /> Who they were you  will have to watch it to see !<br /><br />  Overall,  besides 1 or 2 corny parts in the movie, I think that you will regret it if you don't see this blockbusting film !"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie is a must have for any boy's parent! Our 3 year old has asked for it to be played at least four times since yesterday (when it arrived), and our 1 year old gets all excited and starts making car noises when he watches it with his brother. The movie is very entertaining, with an excellent soundtrack, a good story and best of all, it teaches a lesson. Way to go Disney/Pixar!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I originally purchased this on VCD a few years ago just to see the animation, but the story is so well done that I still put it on a couple of times a year.  It isn't often that you see an animated film with a good story and a great moral point to go with it!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I saw this film twice in two days after my mother in law bought the DVD, and I am likley to buy this myself.  A great film reminiscent of Doc Hollywood, but done nascar style. Lightning Mcqueen is a hot shot rookie racer who gets stranded in a small town after getting scared and tearing up main street after a string of missunderstandings.  After being forced to stay and fix his damange, he grows to like the quaint settings, and it's inhabitents, including the Tow Mater, played by Larry the Cable Guy.  A tale of Love, Friendship, Loyalty, betrayal, and trust.  It has it all.  For the kids, yes... no worse than what bugs bunny used to have in it.  Buy this, You will like it!!!!
B00447G29S	3.0	b	I don't normally write many reviews online but I had to come on and write a quick review about this movie.  Today, I took my 7 year old son to see the Polar Express.  We were both looking forward to it very much and I personally thought it was a well written movie, but....my son went in fully believing and came out with a lot of doubt and a lot of questions to my dismay.  I know that the movie is supposed to make kids with question suddenly believe, but, it did the oposite for us.  It opened his eyes to a lot of things that he hadn't really thought about until he saw it being questioned in the movie.  My advice to parents is that if you bring your kids to the movie, be prepared for the possibility of the doubt coming out of the film.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Amazing production that gets the history right.  Acting, costumes, scenery, extras are all terrific.  I enjoyed the extra about the making of the series and the interview with John McCulloch.  The ability to watch each episode on successive nights was great.  Glad I bought it.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"I look forward to the new Pixar movie every year, and there is good reason for that. They keep pumping out clean entertainment, and ""Cars"" is no different.<br /><br />I found ""Cars"" to be quite different in its approach, as it kind of spoofs Nascar but glorifies it at the same time. I am not a Nascar fan, but I found this to be a truly funny movie. Because of the theme, you can enjoy this as a Nascar fan who has never seen Pixar before OR as a Pixar fan who has never followed Nascar. If you happen to like both--this movie is a bonus for you!<br /><br />The movie pulls all the right strings by being genuinely funny, teaching moral lessons, being romantic, and being melodramatic all at the same time. From that perspective, this may seem like so much cheese to some, and you can be warned. However, this is just part of the Pixar formula, and it seems to work every time.<br /><br />The artwork is grand, and the acting... errr... voices are good too. There are a large number of ""cameo"" appearances as well, and that just adds to the fun. Nothing like trying to play ""spot the star"" with a cartoon full of cars!!<br /><br />All I can say is, if you've enjoyed the previous Pixar films you will enjoy this, and if you've never seen another Pixar movie--now's a good time to start!"
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	This is the first in the sequence of the Harry Potter series that I have not thoroughly enjoyed. I am a big fan of Harry Potter but, was a little disappointing however, it IS still Harry Potter.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This is a must see. I've been hooked since episode one. It has everything you need: a dark sexy vampire,some danger, the supper natural, and a lot of passion.
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	All the hype about this show is true. It is so good. Not blood and guts. Very small town with Vampires, shape shifters humans living, dating amoung eachother. But there are always the trouble makers. It's absolutely a great series and once you have seen the first few episodes, watch out, you will be hooked like the rest of us!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I wasn't consistently working out before, but after I got Insanity I can't stop!!! It's really hard at first and super intense, but once you get into the routine you WANT to keep going. I've been doing it for three weeks and I feel great and I'm starting to see my body change. If you don't follow the meal plan, at least eat healthy and stay away from junk food and sweets. That should do it. I'm pretty excited to see the results!!!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	...this country was founded on the idea of personal liberty, but Expelled reveals the truth about how our liberties are being systematically taken away. For us to live in a free country but have academia legislate to the American public is beyond the pale.<br /><br />This video pulls no punches in dealing with the volatile issue of evolution.<br /><br />Ben Stein did a magnificent job bringing to light the bigotry and outright hatred for anyone who is not a slave to the Darwinist tyranny.<br /><br />This is highly recommended for all ages but especially high school seniors, who are preparing to go to college. They need to be aware of the dangerous implications of a fully developed Darwinian worldview.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is the best movie that I have ever seen, that portrays how a marriage ought to work, and what marrieage is really all about.<br />This is the only movie that I have ever watched 10 times before it left the theatre. Every person in America needs to see this movie, so they can get at least one proper view of how relationships ought to work, after seeing thousands and thousands of terrible views from television, movies, music, etc. Great action, Great comedy, and Great romance, all in one movie.m
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"I'm a huge Frank Miller fan and when I first heard that ""Sin City"" was being made into a movie, I shuddered.  I could just imagine what Hollywood would do to it: cast it wrong, colorize it, water it down, change crucial plot points, sap it like ""Howard the Duck.""<br /><br />My spirits lifted when I learned it would be directed by Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, though I wasn't sure what to make of the fact that so much of it would be digitally generated.<br /><br />In the end, it's hard to imagine another filmmaker making as seamless a print-to-screen adaptation as this.  The characters all look right, the panels were obviously used as storyboards, and Rodriguez brings just enough of his own spark to the direction to make it unique.<br /><br />I liked this movie a lot but at the same time, it left me feeling a little strange.  It's like seeing your favorite indie band suddenly catapaulted from obscurity to arena-sized stages, hearing your favorite obscure song become a Top Ten hit.<br /><br />It also made me wish there was a way I could've experienced it without having read the books first, because if you've read the books, you know almost every single thing that's going to happen when and how it's going to happen.  That's more a criticism of myself as a reader/viewer than it is of the artist or filmmakers. On the other hand, as close as the transition is, the material still unavoidably loses something when recreated in live action, just by the nature of the severity of the actions.  Miller's sharp images are paced as precisely as rifle reports and there's a strange difference between, say, seeing a drawing of Marv dragging a man behind his car and seeing several seconds of footage of Marv dragging a man behind his car.  Still, had I been given the choice between seeing an accurate adaptation and a bad adaptation, I definitely would've chosen this one.  This is what you'd call an accurate adaptation."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This HBO Miniseries really impressed me. JOHN ADAMS is an inspiring watch for any American ! It is filmed great , Produced by Tom Hanks & great acting by PAUL GIAMATTI !
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Fabulous story with something for the entire family.  Lightening McQueen makes friends in unexpected places with unexpected cars.  Fabulous graphics, wonderfully creative and exceptionally entertaining.  *******
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	We had seen a copy of this dvd on Christmas, when our son had<br />purchased it for his oldest daughter. I can't remember when I've<br />laughed as hard in a long time. I find myself mimicking some of the<br />characters. Thoroughly enjoying it and sharing with others
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Very well done movie. Enjoyed movie very much.  Followed the book's story line. Enjoyed seeing the characters come to life. Well done special effects were great. Harry was darker in this movie. Ron was less winy.  Hermine was very brave as was Harry.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My 3-year-old son loves the movie and wants to see it over and over again. And I like it too!
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	I already owned the first 2 Ultimate Edition HP movies which come with the Extended versions of the movies that have the deleted/additional scenes added back into the movie...  This is my FAVORITE part of the first 2!!!!  and the SOLE reason that I purchased all the others!!! Just to receive them and discover that they did not do this for the rest of them!!!  THIS SUCKS!!!!
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is not bad, but it doesn't live up to its brand.  The plot line is a bit out there and is certainly more reminiscent of Lucas's films than Spielberg's.  Several of Indiana Jones's trademark lines and behaviors are preserved, but the intensity of the film's action is much less than previous films.<br /><br />The plot line is more ""out there"" than the previous three films.  There are several elements, such as gold being magnetic, that really pulled me out of the film and lessened the believability of the whole story.  Perhaps, the biggest inadequacy in the film is that the importance of the Crystal Skull is insufficiently explained.<br /><br />Harrison Ford does a commendable job reprising the role of an older Jones.  Shia LaBeouf does a fair job, but this is far from his best performance.<br /><br />I would not hesitate to recommend Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but it is not in the same league as the first three."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Okay I'm not going to give you a book here about my experience with this workout, just know that the results are real as long as you stick to the schedule. I'm just going to tell you what you need to do to survive the 60 days and how to reduce your fatigue and soreness.<br /><br />1. Drink as much water as possible before, during, and after (helps remove lactic acid which causes soreness)<br />2. Eat plenty of HEALTHY foods to fuel your workout, not junk foods! (I am hungry and thirsty all the time due to the demand on my body)<br />3. Wear supportive shoes and purchase a thick workout mat to give support to your joints and back (this workout contains many exercises that punish those areas of your body)<br />4. Stretch, Stretch, Stretch! This will help with soreness. Stretch before, during, and especially after for best results. This also prevents injury. I stretch more and longer than they do on the videos. Also I do different stretches that work better for my body in particular.<br />5. Understand your body and what it is telling you. Your body can be pushed well beyond what you think is possible. By pushing yourself, without injury, you will see results. Don't try to keep up with the people on the dvd! Eat, hydrate, stretch, and you'll be in better shape in 60 days. If you're honest with yourself about giving 110% each workout then the results will be real for you too.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I absolutely love Downey Jr. as an actor and this movie as well. My favorite super hero blockbuster to date. I love the fresh feeling #1 brought to the super hero film family so far. I can't wait until the 3rd!!
B001684L0A	2.0	b	Bare with me, this is just one man's opinion. The acting, writing, visual effects and music on this show deserve 4, possibly 5 stars. But the idiots running the cameras make it nearly impossible to stay focused on these elements. I know, I know, it's Tak Fujimoto. I don't care who shot it, it's poorly done. I am an amateur filmmaker, meaning I do not derive the majority of my income from filmmaking. But I will guarantee you that, given the chance, I would have done a far better job of capturing the efforts of the rest of the cast and crew than did the team of imbeciles who did get paid, no doubt handsomely, to film John Adams. I have a very simple concept about camera work which is this - The viewer should NOT be thinking about the camera. With very few exceptions (POV), the camera should remain transparent.<br /><br /> The camera crew on this production, however, seems to want to take center stage. The camera shakes incessantly, it sits at ridiculous angles, and it gets so close to the actors at times, that it becomes comical. I know that these would be described by the perpetrators as stylistic choices, but these 'stylistic' choices are so distracting, that I seriously wish I hadn't purchased this series. The worst of these offenses is the continually cockeyed camera angles. I kept expecting Adam West to pop out in his Batman costume. And then there are the focus pullers. The ridiculous decisions mentioned above aren't the end of the story. The number of out of focus shots in this series is painful. There is on scene in particular where both characters faces are out of focus through the ENTIRE SCENE. The hair on the sides of their heads however are in focus. Ridiculous.<br /><br />And then there's the transfer... I'm not going to belabor the point, the transfer is subpar, and that's putting it nicely. 'True Blood' and 'Band of Brothers' are both great blu ray transfers from HBO, but somebody dropped the ball on this one.  Just for the record, for those of you who may be interested, 'Band of Brothers' on blu ray is like seeing it for the first time. It  trumps the uprezzed DVD as well as the pseudo HD broadcast on HBO. If you love movies about American history, rent John Adams - buy 'Band of Brothers'.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is a great comedian.  I highly recommend buying the video and seeing him in person.  You will laugh the whole time.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	this is one of the most powerful films you can watch if you want to truly grasp what we're feeling ourselves and our families. It will (should) change the way you shop and the way you perceive what goes into your body. The book is even more detailed and a great reference tool to use before your next grocery outing. Watch this film!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	i think the insanity workout is amazing. i have not been able to work out w/ this intensity since varsity sports in high school. it is an amazing workout that i can do and do again over the years to come. the best features about this workout are that it takes less than an hour and that you only need your body and a small space to do it.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Can't say enough about this adaptation of McCullogh's book. Sure, they had to leave tons of stuff out but that's only because the book is sooo long (even though I absolutely love it). Giamati is great as always and so is Linney; not to mention all the actors, particularly the Washington and Jefferson performances. I've read a ton of Revolutionary War history and this series really captures the feel of those times so powerfully. Highly recommended.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Ambiguity is something that can make a movie great! Rosemary's Baby, The Innocents, Inception, all great films that left their audiences excitedly puzzled and leaves the viewer drawing his or her own conclusions about the movie's mysteries. Such is the case with Prometheus- and I think the mixed reviews stem from many of the Alien fans expecting more face-hugging. Looking past the fact that there are very few H.R. Giger aliens in the film it still has a strong and stable story-line and wonderful cast. Should- in my view be a classic of the sci-fi genre in future!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I saw this man on tv years ago (1998 or earlier) and he had Peanut the Woozle, Walter the grump, and Jose Jalapeno (on a stick).  I died laughing.  I watched that show several times and I could not get enough of him.<br /><br />I kept looking around for him and could not find him anywhere on ticketmaster!!!  I finally found out where they were after going to www.jeffdunham.com (which is actually www.onastick.com)!<br /><br />FINALLY I hear he's going to be on the Comedy channel.  I watched that show twice!  I ordered the DVD from Amazon (THANK YOU) and ran to get it from the mail when I heard it was in.<br /><br />I love Peanut.  He is my most favorite of ALL his buddies.<br /><br />I can only give this five stars, but wish I could give more!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Critical look at confrontation between the discipline and philosophy of science. Documentary raises important questions concerning integrity of scientific community. This is not a creation versus evolution treatment, but an investigative report on the politics within the scientific community. Well done.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I was never a huge fan of ventriolquism but Jeff Dunham is amazing. He is so unbelievably talented that its worth getting the DVD just to watch him perform. The added bonus is that he is hilarious. The routines he has with all of his puppets are equally funny and will have you laughing from beginning to end. This is not a comedy routine for the youngsters because of foul language and inappropriate topics. This is a great stand-up comedy routine that all adults should see.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	"With all the hype about this movie I thought it would be entertaining enough to keep my girl friend awake.  She falls asleep during every movie we see.  This time I fell asleep twice. Some good scenes but this movie is boring, jumpy in terms of characters and ""what the hell does that mean"" in terms of one liners and dumb look scenes like at the very end.  This could have been a real good movie if some consistency and thought had been placed in making things like the journey over regular countryside more dangereous and longer than through the deadly dark forrest.  And the troll???????  As to her acting, well two dimensions, is two dimesnisons."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"Anyone whose read my other reviews can tell you that I HATE multiple DVD releases.  We all know it's either the studios or the filmmakers (probably both) trying to milk as much cash as possible from the fans.  Robert Rodriguez, one of the ""young turk"" filmmakers of the '90s, I think, now suffers from the ""Lucas Syndrome"" - that is, the ""I'm justified in making as much money as I can from my artistic vision because I worked my way to the top"" mentality that true all-around film artists develop once they become part of ""the Establishment"" they hated so much as youngsters.  Maybe so.  I'd believe this too if Rodriguez hadn't earlier showed himself to be all about the fans with his previous home-video releases.  Still and all, this guy really DOES deserve it to the extent that, unlike George, he's more ""hands-on"" than anyone in Hollywood because A: he wears ALL the creative hats behind the camera, and B: the man believes - REALLY believes - in outdoing himself creatively.<br /><br />Which brings us to ""Sin City"" - the theatrical cut, the ""director's cut,"" and the DVD's.  I feel, and this is just my opinion, that the bear-bones first home release was just to get a quick cash flow and tweak Disney for the way they treated the Weinstein brothers.  How else can you explain why Rodriguez would release a version with only the Electronic Press Kit (EPK) as a ""special feature"" (and the only one at that)?  Yet it was good for the movies' sake, because ""Sin City"" was yet another bold new direction for Sir Robert.  In many interviews he was quoted that the flaw of adapting comic book titles to the screen was adapting them to the realities of motion picture. Here, he made the film medium adapt to the comics, and created something new.  Something truly revolutionary in film.  Something that was disturbingly beautiful.  He did more than make four of Frank Miller's noir series work on film - he (along with Miller, who gets a co-directing nod) made film work around the comic's artistic motifs.<br /><br />This wasn't easy.  To do it, he had to film every single actor in green screen and create a reality around them; sometimes with noone to react to where they would be later seen to be talking to another person.  It's been done before - the beautiful but flawed ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" comes to mind - but here it works.<br /><br />For those who, like me, couldn't wait for the second cut (a mistake I WON'T be repeating with ""Blade Runner"") - one might feel resentful with having to purchase yet another DVD.  Well, put that out of your mind because, not only do we get all the extras goodness - studio featurettes, an interactive character's guide to Basin City, and the quirky Rodriguez behind-the-scenes ""film schools,"" green screen rushes, party footage, etc. - but we see the complete Sin City stories recut, added to, and retold, yet again in their original format.  Sure, they didn't add a whole lot of new footage, but what's there further develops the stories as Frank Miller wrote them.  With all this, you get a paperback reprint of ""The Long Goodbye,"" three new commentary tracks, and the satisfaction that this repurchase was WORTH the cash.<br /><br />Besides, worse case scenario, you can resell your first ""Sin City"" DVD used.  I guarentee you, with this cut, you won't need it."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Excellent movie! Love the message! We are buying the movie! My kids saw it like five times in two days!
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	This movie seems to be biased against the big food industry, the ones that provided that triple bypass with cheese for 99 cents you just had for lunch. It does however provide an intriguing look into the mass food/fast food industry and how consumers are being manipulated. It shows a lowly soybean farmer being harrased by a big corporation, and without giving us all the facts, tries to create sympathy for the poor fellow when in fact he was probably involved in illegal activity. This movie also exposes the ugliness of the mass slaughtering of animals and is rather disturbing.<br />In my opinion this movie doesn't address the obvious - over population! Without the mass food industry the world would be starving.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	As usual, I didn't know a thing about Iron Man before going to see it. I'm one of the many who probably hasn't read the comic books. And as a smart person said when we were sitting in a (very packed) cinema, 95% of the people in the cinema wouldn't have read the comic books either.<br /><br />So what did I know about Iron Man? Well, from the endless photos of Gwyneth Paltrow looking gorgeous, wearing very short skirts, and very high heels, in the press, I guess that she has a small role in it? I didn't see any photos of Robert Downey Jnr promoting the movie, it all seemed to focus on Gwyneth's very long legs.<br /><br />From the impressive beginning, you know that Iron Man is going to work. Although the VFX do feel similar at times to Transformers (done by the same company, Industrial Light & Magic, don't you know), it succeeds where Spiderman 3 spectacularly failed. Not only is Robert perfect for the Tony Stark/Iron Man role, he's cute as well. Hello!<br /><br />The story is basically like this: Tony Stark is CEO of Stark Industries, which produces really hi-tech weapons for the military. After his father's death, Tony inherited the company, and is now a billionaire. He has a fancy house, and a love for women. Who he then gets his assistant to throw out once he's finished with them. When in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test, his convoy is attacked, and he is injured, and taken hostage, but his life is saved by a doctor. When the terrorists force Tony to reproduce the weapon, he builds an impressive suit of armour, and escapes. The suit gets destroyed but is rebuilt in the US, where it gives Tony what else, but superhuman strength. He wants revenge.<br /><br />The special effects & technology used in this movie will absolutely blow you away. I mean, wow! It's absolutely breath taking. I'm not going to ruin this movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, but go, go, go! The action scenes in themselves are unreal. Not only do they work, but they take your breath away.<br /><br />The supporting cast was amazing. Gwyneth played the part for Pepper really well, and even managed to run a little in skyscraper heels. How does she manage it? I can barely walk in heels never mind run. Terrence Howard I have a feeling might get a bigger role hopefully in the next movie, it's certainly hinting that way. Jeff Bridges as the bad guy was unbelievable. The bald head really gave me the creeps, and gave the character an extra something. He's a seriously unlikeable character, and makes you root for Tony even more. And for all those reviewers who have complained that Samuel L Jackson is listed in the cast, but doesn't appear - hello duh??? I'll give you a hint. His scene was not left on the cutting room floor. He does appear. You just have to find the fast forward button. Put it this way, there will definitely be a sequel.<br /><br />I cannot wait to get this movie on DVD. Hopefully, it will be two discs (no bare bones DVDs for me!), loaded with extras and I want LOADED!!! I want to know how they did this, how they did that, and I want to see Robert in training. Woohoo. They can go all out with the extras on this DVD so lets hope they do.<br /><br />All I can say is go see this movie. You will not regret it.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Apparently the only reason is to have that nice academy award slip cover to look like the other newer Warner Home Video releases - the aspect ratio difference appears to be a typo, that wouldn't make much sense to change that.  [...] has more if you want to read it.<br /><br />Really great movie by the way - I'll buy the new one because of the nice cover, same price :)<br /><br />James in Folsom CA
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	For sure only the cast and famous director made this movie somehow successful, otherwise the script was not original and reminded me of one of the old western in which heroes & villains all end up dead.acting of jack nicoulson was over exaggerated and for sure was not<br /><br />one his best.I was just waiting for the movie to end asap.
B00447G29S	3.0	b	"I was full of anticipation for this film, but was disappointed to a certain degree. Though it does have many good qualities and I enjoyed some of it, I felt the filmmakers took out much of the warmth of the story and focused too much on the cool high-action effects they could incorporate. It distracted from the magic this story could have woven, and I can imagine much of it actually being scary to kids--who I thought were the intended audience.<br />Also, again...with what looked like the intent to appear ""cool"", rather then genuine, Christmas town looked cold & industrial, rather then enchanting. I don't think these people get what childhood is about...It felt like creating something wonderful for kids was not their focus, but rather all of their their special new software and equipment they got to tryout."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	It seemed I no sooner had ordered this True Blood DVD and it was here at my door! It was brand new, as stated, and I'm very happy with my purchase, and this seller.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I ordered this for my 18 year old daughter who loves Harry Potter!  She was happy to get the movie (I gave it to her as soon as it was received in the mail, which was the day it was released!)  Great service as always with Amazon.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"I have not read the Cormac McCarthy novel on which this movie is based, so I can't use that to assess the movie.  In any case, two or three hour feature films are necessarily very different than three hundred page novels.<br /><br />This is a very violent film, but the violence is more the fabric of the film than the point of it.  I have to say that when the film ended the way it did, I was somewhat ticked off.  Then, as I thought about the title, the opening narration, and the ending, I was able to see an interpretation of the film where this ending makes a lot of sense.  Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Ed Tom Bell opens expressing a difficulty with the modern world where crime isn't an aberration, but far too normal.  At one point in the film, Bell has a poignant conversation with an old family friend, Ellis, who is now confined to a wheel chair after being wounded in the line of duty.  They talk about the decadence of the time, and this note is touched on again and again.  While, I could go on for pages about this, I think one point is that law enforcement is meant to clean up the spills and messes that occur in a largely orderly and moral society.  However, when the spills turn into floods of immorality, drugs, murder, greed, and thievery, well, the lawmen of the former age, the old men, realize this is no longer a country in which they can do their old job. In fact, it is a world in which the very idea of law has become an anachronism.<br /><br />The central focus of evil in the film is a character with all the pity, humanity, and warmth of a Great White Shark, Anton Chigurh (a wonderfully chilling portrayal by Javier Bardem).  This creature (hardly a man) moves through society seeking after something as an excuse to prey on humanity as if each person were no more than animals coming to his slaughterhouse.  During the film he is after a couple of million dollars Stephen Root's nameless businessman invested in a drug deal gone bad.  It was first stolen and then found by Llewelyn Moss (well portrayed by Josh Brolin) as he was out hunting for food.  Moss and his wife, Karla Jean (Kelly MacDonald give a very fine performance), are very poor and live in a run down trailer.  Moss thinks he is tougher and more aware of what he needs to do than he really is.  Frankly, he is quite good in the near term tactics of a situation, but can't see the larger forces working around him, and this is where he makes his serious mistakes.<br /><br />So, Sheriff Bell is trying to find Chigurh, becomes aware of Moss and tries to help him and his wife, Roots nameless business man is trying to recover his money, and a group of Mexicans want the money they think is theirs because it is associated with the bad drug deal.  Root hires Carson Wells (nicely done by Woody Harrelson), a bounty hunter, to get his money and stop Chigurh.  Wells is confident, even overconfident, he can do both and is quite talented at what he does.<br /><br />But the plot, and I will leave the rest for you to work out, is really only the thing that ties all the wonderful conversations together.  Short or long, it is the people talking together about all this disaster happening around them that makes the film so worthwhile.  Yes, the film is harsh and grim, but the goodness of Bell and his associates almost redeems things.  I don't share McCarthy's and the Coen Brothers despondent view of the world and, in the end, I reject the film's ethos.  Still, there are many many worse films to see.  It is far better than ""There Will Be Blood"" to compare it to one of its contemporaries.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a great movie. Even the special features are subtitled which is great for deaf folks like me.
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	"When I read the book I said ""Well, it was fun while it lasted.""  With ""The Order of the Phoenix"" you can point exactly to where the fun stopped and the franchise died.  800 pages of Harry scowling and barking at everyone was no day at the beach and, unfortunately, the movie is true to its literary source.  And no, I will not purchase this movie nor any others that follow; as far as I'm concerned the series ended with The Goblet of Fire.  It's a shame J. K. Rowling couldn't have just continued to have as much fun with the last three books as she did with the first four; you can have drama without making the narrative so unrelentingly dark and dreary."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	A movie like Iron Man only comes out once every few years in my opinion. A movie that blows away the competition and leaves the viewer wanting more. After waiting for months on news of its DVD release I pre-ordered it from Amazon and couldn't be happier. Robert Downey Jr is definitely at his best, Jeff Bridges performance is equal as well.<br />The DVD comes with loads of special features (at least on the two disc edition) and is a prize to behold.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	Not one of this review's even comes close to what Night was trying to get across to his viewers. The Village is probably the best allegory's ever made. To get to the point, think of what continuoesly happens in politics. What do people raise to scare the public. It is all about control. We elected this control to continue there reign over people. Think about what happened all over our country one month ago and what they do ever 5months  or so.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	First of all the cast selected was superb.  M. Night could not have chosen better.  Many people do not understand this film (from what I can tell about the other reviews.)  It is about what fear can do to people.  Even when there are no monsters they become real when they are created in our minds.  That's where they have the most power to affect us.  Movie thrillers of the past new how to use this fact.  They didn't need to have blood splattering everywhere or to actually show a psycho beheading someone.  They (namely Alfred Hitchcok) just had to create the idea of these things happening to terrify.  That way everyone's own imagination will create their own nightmare.  I have watched this movie many times (I am as I'm writing this) and I see new things to admire about it everytime.  Only one thing I would change.  The monsters wear red cloaks.  They're monsters and yet they are skilled enough to weave, dye and sew cloth?  Or they could have gone to the monster outlet store.  Oh well, I don't care.  Still love this movie.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This was absolutely hilarious.  really picked up my day.<br /><br />Laughed all night long with Jeff.  Superb, wonderfully funny.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	Sin City (Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, 2005)<br /><br />A lot of people are going to hate Sin City. A lot of people already do, actually, judging by the reactions of the crowd coming out of the theater where I saw it Friday. Yet only three days after its release, it sits (as of this writing) at #112 on IMDB's Top 250, and at least a smattering of critics have praised it. So there are at least a few people getting it.<br /><br />Sin City is old-school film noir. If you're not a big fan of sitting in arthouses watching revivals of old Joseph Cotten films that were just discovered in vaults after being undisturbed for sixty years, you're probably not going to get terribly much out of it. Much of what the critics have criticized in the film, especially the shallowness of the characters, is very much in the style of traditional noir, and as such seemed to me to be strengths, and not weaknesses, of the film. Think of Sin City as an homage to Billy Wilder as much as graphic novel adaptations, and it'll make more sense.<br /><br />All that aside, the one thing the critics have agreed on is the style. And what style it has. Sin City is one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in the past decade-- certainly since Begotten, back in 1991. Unlike Begotten, which struck the viewer with its continuing unwillingness to give you a complete picture of what was going on, Sin City revels in clarity. While much of the film's violence is rendered in cut-away drawn shots, as opposed to the live-action carnage one expects from Rodriguez, the sketched-out scenes paradoxically heighten, rather than mask, the brutality. (Don't worry, boys, the nudity is all real, even if it doesn't include Jessica Alba.)<br /><br />From the standpoint of the plot, your best bet is probably to think of Sin City as Pulp Fiction on steroids. Rodriguez juggles the plots in roughly the same way Tarantino did in Pulp Fiction, but without as much parallelism. There's really not much to say about the plots; this is noir. Plot is secondary to style. There are plots, however, rest assured.<br /><br />To try and cover all the actors in this film worth mentioning would take a thousand words in itself. Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Benicio del Toro, Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Nick Stahl head the list for the macho component, and Jessica Alba, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, James King, Carla Gugino, Brittany Murphy, and Alexis Bledel get the top billing for the ladies. And I've just scratched the surface. There is a huge amount of starpower in this movie. (When Josh Hartnett and Nicky Katt are that far down in the credits, you know most of the film's budget was spent on the actors, right?) For the most part, the actors do their thing with liveliness, though there are a few stumbling blocks in the road. The biggest of these is Michael Madsen, which came as quite a shock given that only a few months ago I was praising him to the heavens for making Kill Bill vol. II such a pleasurable experience. A number of parts are overacted, but once again, it's expected in noir. Mickey Rourke, especially, chews scenery in a way that hasn't been seen much since Charlton Heston stopped being a rugged male lead.<br /><br />Simply put, you'll either love it or hate it. How did you feel about the original version of The Desperate Hours? If, like me, you thought it was both William Wyler and Humphrey Bogart's best work, you're probably going to get a real kick out of Sin City. If you thought it was boring and overacted, well, you get the idea. Me, I'd sit through it again right now, if I weren't sitting here writing reviews. ****
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My 3 year old loved the Finding Nemo DVD (enough to watch it over 20 times) so we decided to take him to the movies to see Cars.  You've never seen a 3 and half year old behave so well!  He was mesmerized.  We went back 2 more times.  Now the DVD is out and he's already seen it twice.  He laughed out loud during Mater and the Ghost Light short.  He gets the humor and loves the characters - Dab Gum Pixar - you've done it again!
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Snow White and The Huntsman was a good movie we really enjoyed watching it- since we could not seem to get to the movie theatre while it was playing.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	If you are going to watch part one, you need to rent or buy part two at the same time, I think it's wrong to make a two parter and leave it as it did in part one, but as we can tell the writers just made this slow moving thing to get kids to pay to watch part two. I can't believe I paid real money to watch this crap.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"I really have to thank a friend of mine for getting me in on the Sin City scene, after loaning me the first installment of the comic series, 'The Hard Goodbye', I was hooked and immediately wanted to see the movie.  Fortunately, he had the DVD, borrowed it to me, and I sat down for the ride of a lifetime.  From the opening scene the film is arresting and hypnotic, the imagery used by Rodriguez in bringing Frank Miller's 2-dimensional comic into a 3-dimensional realm is absolutely perfect, especially crediting the select moments in which the film was translated into a streaming animated comic-like appearance.<br /><br />The opening scene already features two very accomplished actors, Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton, and was shot even before the actual film was greenlit.  This scene was shot without Frank Miller's concent in order to persuade him into allowing a full-length feature to be made, and thankfully it was a success.  The finished product was something that I believe comic fans and movie-goers alike will find mind-bogglingly stunning for years to come.  But they won't have just this film to chew on, Sin City 2 has already moved into pre-production for a release date sometime in 2006, while yet a third installment is to follow in 2008.<br /><br />Sin City focuses on the tales of three separate people, dealing with their own problems on the filthy streets and back alleys of Basin City, where crime is the law, violence a sport, and murder a means of survival.  The first full story centering around Marv (Mickey Rourke), a hulking volatile Spawn-like figure goes on a murderous rampage to avenge the death of the only true friend and lover he ever had.  The violence is prominent, and the Kill Bill-stylishness of it all just makes you want to go back and watch it all again.  The second story follows a calm but insane and mysterious nightowl by the name of Dwight, as portrayed by Clive Owen.  Out of all the characters in this translation, he played the role with such ingenuity and twistedness.  This guy doesn't take crap from anybody, especially the two-timing infectious smug hot-headed cretens who get their kicks off of smacking women around and treating them like their own personal playthings.  The third and final tale (which begins before Marv's story and is continued after Dwight's) introduces us to Detective Hartigan, a good cop with a bad attitude and a real problem with authority, and on top of that, a heart condition.  But that doesn't stop him as he sets out to protect 19-year-old Nancy Callahan from the twisted clutches of Senator Roark's pedophile son, who has now become a disgusting, stinking yellow pervert.<br /><br />Be warned, parents.  Sin City is very violent, so this isn't a movie you should be taking your kids to.  While some of the content is implied rather than over the top and in your face, it still does go, well, over the top, which is why the adult audience will get more out of it.  Hollywood is becoming quite overrun with tame PG-13 action films all centering around some low-rent deadbeat who loses his family and has to quote un quote ""make them pay"".  I won't lie to you by telling you the concept of revenge isn't beneath the surface of this film, but what I will tell you is this isn't just high-flying martial arts kick-to-the-face action with little blood and no pain to teach a lesson.  This is raw, bloody and extremely violent.  The bad guys are always getting limbs severed, ears shot off, hatchets to the nuts, what have you.  This movie is far from tame and it's far from PG-13.  I will say that some of the action is somewhat exaggerated, but that's the entire point.  You have to let yourself go with the flow and enjoy the comic-to-screen dynamics which are put forth here.  The dialogue, action, angles, shots, even atmosphere are all captured exacting to Frank Miller's original comic series, which is what most film adaptations are missing these days.  It just isn't bound by the laws most action films are, it really lets go and takes you on one heck of a wild ride.<br /><br />As if the main characters weren't enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen, there is an enormous all-star support cast featuring Jaime King as Marv's lover, the mysterious and hypnotic Goldie, Nick Stahl as the twisted Yellow B@st@rd, and let's not forget Elijah Wood as the cat-like cannibal martial-artist Kevin.  I'd just like to take a moment to point out that while Wood didn't exactly match the appearance of Kevin from the comic (i.e. in the comic he was taller, not as clean-shaven, etc.), he was still just damn cool to watch.  Now that I see him on screen and playing this character, it's hard to think anyone else could fill the spot, he did a flat-out awesome job in bringing the character to life, and this is a role that I will always know and respect him for.<br /><br />Other supporting actors feature Michael Clarke Duncan, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Jessica Alba, Benicio Del Toro, and Devon Aoki.  Even most of the smaller roles are portrayed by relatively known people.  I don't know if I've ever heard of another film that had as many accomplished actors as this one, and it just goes to show you how much of a fan base this kind of film really has, and how it continues to draw fans from around the world.  I know I'm one of them.  Fan of the comic or not, if you like murder, revenge, blood, violence, action, and dark humor, this is your kind of movie."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"I saw this film in theaters and absolutely loved it; I purchased the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy a week ago and was ecstatic to rewatch the film. The video and audio quality is superb and the bonus features (though seemingly fewer due to the eventual Ultimate Edition) add great insight to the film. The Digital Copy in fact does work (even though it apparently expired in September) and I'm downloading it as I type this. ""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is a great installment to the film series and I'm glad I have it in my collection. And at the current price, it's a no brainer to purchase it."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Actually, I saw the two famous actors showing us two same and at the same time different characters. Yes, sometimes, this movie asks questions you have no answers to, but... still it is worth seeing.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	We did not let our kids watch it, as it showed extreme marital tension, but we feel this is a great movie for couples to see. For better or for worse... until death parts us...
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	This movie has been drastiucally cut from the book but still the scenes not cut are phonimally well couragraphed and the musice is awasome.The best of the five scores that I have heard so far. Though Harry potter V  lacks some of intensity of the last film Goblet of Fire had midway through it. It makes up however with decent acting and phonimal special effectss. But some parts needed to be removed or shorten to speed up the movie.  Th scene when harry is put on trial for using a protnaus charm when he and his mean cousin doudley are attacked by dementors. Unfortunately some of the vitally important scene like Harry going to the department of Minstry was drastically altered from the book and sirus blacks role was drastically reduce to speed up the plot. As well which may have spoiled this film for some of Fans of the series who had to high expectatios. Other than several other changes and some other parrts that were cut out including Harry being banned from Quiditch as one of his punishments for try to tell the truth. Depsite this the film is still phonimally good or a stinko ro depending on how high your expectations are. So you will either fall in love with this film our you'll want to take a flamethrower to it depends on what your expantations are. After Harry break the laws of underage sorcery he is put on trial and almost thrown out of school. But the charges are over thrown he goes back to school. In the book this scene went on forever. Cornelous Fudge is so desperate to keep his job and to keep Harry quiet he even uses past magical violations of Harry Potter's including the infamous floating cake done by Dobby the house elf to get Harry Potter convicted. Unfortunaely he fales to persuade enough of the Jury in both the film and book. We also get a new teacher Proffesor Umbrige from Harry's trial becomes the new defense against the dark arts teacher she makes life miserable for the students especialy Harry Potter. Even though at least half of her cruel and sinster rules and tutor scenes were cut out you will loave her from beginning to end making her the perfect villian. You actually barely see Voldermort in any of the movies he usually does not appear until the finally of ever movie except Prizonner of Askaban in which he was excluded and replace with Wormtail instead at the end of the finally. You she him sliglyt more in this one and in the Goblet of Fire but not much. Can Harry figure out what the vision he is seeing are and what Voldermort is up to before its to late. Will the school find away to ride it of the  vile and wretched Proffesor Umbridg and hat fate lies in store for the current Secret society or Order of the phonix members? To find out these answers read Harry Potter and the half blood prince and the Deathly Hallows to find out what becomes of the order. To find out if Voldermort's plains for this installement succeds find out in the thrilling action packed and tear jerking conclusion to this 2005 clasic movie. Will Harry stop Voldermort and what terrible price will he have to pay stop the mysterious item located deep in the depths of the Depapartment of Mysters from falling into Voldermort's filth, vile, and wrinkly hands.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"Obviously, I didn't really like this movie. After seeing it, I almost laughed out loud when I remembered this was supposed to be a horror movie. It wasn't the least bit scary at any parts, except for when the first sighting of ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" occured. Everything else, in my opinion, would probably be classified as drama. It was pretty off-the-plot, and had the most boring beginning and most trailed-off ending ever (I didn't even find out if Lucius lived or not). Please don't waste your money, and if you have any interest in seeing it, borrow it from a friend. But DO NOT waste your money."
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	This is worth the buy when it makes it to the 5-7 dollar bargain bluray bin, so if it gets there pick it up. The previews before the movie should have been a clue this is a B-movie, nothing more. To be fair I watched the extended cut, the shorter version may be less painful...lol
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"I loved ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" in the theater (saw it many times, including in IMAX), and having the DVD is wonderful.  Daniel Radcliffe has matured tremendously as an actor, and his performace during the possession scene, in particular, is chilling!<br /><br />HOWEVER . . . I have a bone to pick with Warner Bros.  I want to see in-depth interviews with the cast.  The interviews on this DVD are minimal.  I loved the ""Trailing Tonks"" feature when it was on the movie set, but you didn't need to spend so much time in the canteen!  The extra scenes should've been in the film itself - some of them added a great deal to the meaning of the film.  And I read about ""pop-ups"" the actors took a great deal of time to do, and they only appear in the HD version????  A lot of people aren't buying HD or Blu-Ray players until the HD/Blu-Ray ""wars"" are over and the prices come down!  So why tease us with interviews with Dan saying these pop-ups he did took a lot of effort and show how serious he is as an actor, and then make them unavailable to most of the world???  I am very disappointed with Warner Bros. as a result of this - and the films are entirely too short.  I hope they won't shortchange us on the rest of the films in the series!<br /><br />Overall, the sets, lighting, all the crafts work are fabulous.  But WHY doesn't Dumbledore have any other robes than these stupid pale blue ones??  Those aren't at all like what he wore in the books (he wore brilliant colors in the books with shimmering embroidery that moved!).  And the string around his beard is just stupid.  Gambon does a good job of portraying Dumbledore in this film, much better than in previous films, but still, he isn't so unlike the book Dumbledore, it's sad, and it's all Cuaron's fault for changing Dumbledore's ""look"" in Prisoner of Azkaban.<br /><br />Rupert Grint was wonderful in this film and the new screenwriter finally let him be the hero he's meant to be, not the buffoon Steve Kloves made him into in the last several films.<br /><br />Evanna Lynch finally made me like Luna Lovegood, who never excited me before.  Evanna was a wonderful find - kudos to whoever cast her!  And I loved the Thestrals - they were fabulous!<br /><br />And Dan Radcliffe - he was simply wonderful in this film.<br /><br />I hope Warner Bros. treats the fans with more respect and gives us more interviews with the cast and more features about how the films are made on future DVDs - and doesn't keep special things like the pop-ups exclusive to the Blu-Ray ones! Bad form, WB!!!!  Shame on you!"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	If you love True Blood you'll love this! The extra's are great and I love that I can watch them whenever.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"Let's just say that i slept throught the whole film...Dont waste your money on ""the village"" its horrible."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I couldn't believe some of our social issues in America were tied so deeply to our food industry. Definetely changed the way I ate and shopped, and I think is a must see for anyone in the states.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	"Based on the fifth book in J.K Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series, ""The Order of the Phoenix"" first hit the big screen in 2007. The film opens with the end of the summer holidays approaching, in a playground close to the Dursley family home. Harry and Dudley are enjoying a little verbal sparring, which is unfortunately brought to a sharpish end when a group of Dementors attack the pair. Harry naturally performs the Patronus. However, this leads to a rapidly delivered letter from the Ministry, threatening our young hero with expulsion - although the cavalry, led by Moody and Tonks, aren't long in arriving. Harry is quickly escorted to 12 Grimmauld Place - the ancestral home of the Black family and headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix.<br /><br />The Order of the Phoenix is a secret society formed by Dumbledore, consisting of people who had fought Voldemort previously. Its members include Mr and Mrs Weasley, Tonks, Professor Lupin, Mad Eye Mooney and Harry's godfather, Sirius. Harry's parents were also members, and Harry is quite keen to join the fight. However, it soon becomes clear there are differences of opinion within the Order on how much Harry should be involved - with his age being only a partial concern. Sirius, naturally, believes Harry should be told everything...however, it appears he's been kept in the dark on Dumbledore's instructions. Still, Harry is relieved to learn the threat of expulsion has been withdrawn - pending a hearing at the Ministry.<br /><br />It proves to be a tough year for Harry. This year, he's due to sit his OWLs - wizard's exams - so his workload has increased dramatically. Things aren't made any easier by the series of nightmares he suffers from - generally centred around Voldemort. Furthermore, after the events outlined in ""The Goblet of Fire"", both Harry and Dumbledore are being viewed with scorn by the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet. Neither organisation is willing to believe that Voldemort is back, fully recovered. Therefore, they're attacking anyone who says differently - Harry and Dumbledore are the two biggest targets. (Dumbledore reckons Fudge is anywhere but in his right mind - largely due to fear). As a result, it's barely a surprise that the Ministry decide to interfere at Hogwarts. Dolores Umbridge, a Ministry employee who is devoted to Fudge is appointed to the staff as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She proves to be an absolute nightmare : she loves pink, squeaks a great deal, oozes insincerity and inspires more contempt than even Malfoy. As the year progresses, she increasingly interferes with the running of Hogwarts, and bullying anyone she feels isn't following the party line. Additionally her teaching is woefully inadequate. She believes a purely theoretical approach to the Defence Against the Dark Arts will be sufficient as, she claims, there are no Dark Wizards the pupils need to defend themselves from.<br /><br />Harry feels a real sense of isolation during the year - Dumbledore appears to be avoiding him, while Hagrid is missing for long stretches. Some of the other pupils feel his claims about Voldemort are making their lives unnecessarily complicated and, at times, he even pushes Ron and Hermione away. In fact, at times his letters to Sirius seem to be his only way of getting things off his chest. However, it's not all bad - he makes some nifty progress on the Cho front, and he also finds a new friend in Luna Lovegood. Luna, played by Evanna Lynch, totally steals the show. Luna is something of a conspiracy theorist and is picked on and gossiped about behind her back. However, for all the apparent ditziness, she occasionally gets things that no-one else does and is quite clever in an un-Hermione sort of way. She's also able to get through Harry's defences and offer him a bit of help and support just when he needs it the most.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, given the length of the book, not everything makes it into the film. Despite the fact there are OWLs on the horizon, nobody - not even Hermione - seems to be remotely concerned. There's no Quidditch and a little more time spent on Neville would have been nice. While Harry made big progress with Cho, I thought it odd that the post-mistletoe events were brushed over. However, the film is hugely enjoyable : in addition to Luna, Tonks is gorgeous, Gary Oldman was great as Sirius and Helena Bonham Carter was outstanding in her too-brief appearance as Bellatrix. (Hopefully, we'll get much more in the films to come). Some of the sets are fantastic too : Grimmauld Place is very stylish in a tatty and dusty sort of way, while the Ministry is hugely impressive. Great stuff overall, certainly recommended."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Another great Harry Potter move.  I can't wait for part 2.  Great packaging with DVD, Blu-Ray, and instructions to download a digital copy of PC or iPad.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	Interesting story, great acting. Leaves you asking a lot of questions - in a good way. Great visuals/directing. Worth buying if you're a fan of The Coens or just like good drama/action/mystery that looks cool too. I thought Tommy Lee Jones sucked, which is why I didn't give it a full 5. His character felt boring and underdeveloped. Otherwise, no major complaints about this film.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This gift set has been one of the greatest value for money purchases I have found in a long time,a car each for My boys and the dvd for their play room and the Blueray for Me....cer-chow !
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	First of all, I loved the movie.  It's wonderfully told and imagined and a great build up for the final film. Definitely worth buying!<br /><br />I am,however, disappointed with the quality of the film transfer to DVD. It has possibly some of the most pixelated images I have ever seen in a DVD. This is especially evident when the scenes are dark, which is most of the movie.  I'm not sure why this is so bad on the DVD compared to other films of similar darkness and length....but I think they should have put more focus into clearing it up some.<br /><br />Otherwise, I love it....just wish it has the opening scene from part 2 as the bluray version does.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Wow what a terrific film. Not many films can get away with being over two hours long, but this movie kept my attention for all of its 122 minutes. The plot is loosely based on ""A Simple Plan"" in which someone finds some drug money by chance, and intent on keeping this, puts himself and his family in danger. The way in which the story is told owes much to Pulp Fiction, with several groups of characters who never meet each other, or whom only do so en passant. Likewise, there is a debt owed to Psycho; where the audience is wrong-footed into thinking that one character is the star of the film, only to have that character give way to another person part way through the film. The Coen brothers go one better than Hitchcock, however, and have a third good guy (Woody Harrelson from Cheers) take over halfway through, only to be blown to bits a short while later.<br /><br />There is some controversy over whether this is a western. It's debatable, but my vote goes to ""yes"". There's classic western themes of good against bad, people both good and bad operating outside the law, a law which proves ineffectual due to the huge extent of gun ownership, the setting on the Tex-Mex border, the scene with horses, and the white cowboy hats worn by all four of the principle good guys. There's even an ""old timer"" there to tell tales and give advice.<br /><br />In contrast to the white hat-wearers, Chiguhr, Javier Bardem's baddie wears only black for most of the film(in fact it has to be said, he has a very gay sense of style, from his hair, to his cropped jacket and tight buttock-revealing trousers...notably he only seems to be enjoying himself when on the floor strangling a policeman who is lying on top of him in a very homoerotic fashion). The star of the film is undoubtedly this villain, the peculiar looking and acting Javier Bardem, and he has a truth to his character consitent with his zealous belief in principles. His callousness might seem unbelievable, but it's clear that this is an instinct which ensures his survival at times when lesser baddies fall by the wayside. He is consistent, whereas the good people are inconstant, lose concentration, or make unnecessary allowances.<br /><br />Josh Brolin plays the everyman character who finds the money, being a resourceful Vietnam veteran with McGuyver-like skills at making things, now making a meagre living and living in a trailer home. He's likeable despite being trigger happy and a little amoral at times.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones's Sherrif decides to retire BEFORE he gets old, having found many old men killed during the course of his investigation (hence the title). By contrast, women don't come off very well in this film. It's almost irrelevant whether the main female character lives or dies (it's not shown), and most women are either there as support for men, a nagging mother-in-law, or harridan-like gate-keepers. Only the final scene of Kelly MacDonald's character Carla, shows her to have any character, and in this one scene she does what no man has done before; she refuses to play Chiguhr's game. How this is resolved isn't seen on screen, but it's interesting that no women are seen to be killed in this movie.<br /><br />In contrast to Pulp Fiction, the film benefits from the minimalist score. There's no sweeping James Horner strings or Danny Elfman cellos here. The sound is presented as though it's all naturalistic, for example the first ten minutes or so are accompanied only by the sound of the wind, giving the impression of the stark, desolate landscape much better than a score could ever do.<br /><br />Apart from Brolin and Jones, the film is cast mainly with lesser-known actors who all put in competent performances, leading us to concentrate on the duels and gun battles between the four main characters. Although there isn't a normal resolution to the film, it does seem quite satisfying at the end that Jones's character is still alive, even though he doesn't succeed in capturing Chiguhr.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Pulp Fiction, Westerns, and intelligent cinema."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"This movie is great for boys and girls alike.  My two year old was enamored and actually had a CARS party for her third birthday.  She became obsessed with collecting each of the CARS.  She was also the only girl in her daycare with lightup Lightening McQueen shoes (yes, boys shoes - they make NO girl CARS stuff).  The movie is cute and the G rating is appropriate.  There is only one scary scene where Mater and Lightening go ""tractor tipping"" and a large tractor named ""Frank"" chases them through the field.  The story is simple enough for young children to understand the plot, but interesting enough for the parents that will no doubt have to sit through it countless times."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This Mini-Series was nothing short of amazing.  It brings history to life in an exciting way.  I have been to Philadelphia many times before and seen the historical sights.  Now that I have seen the movie, I go back with new wonder for what the founding fathers did for all Americans.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Some of the segments make you disgusted, but it is very enlightening. Worth the watch!
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	This is an okay film but you can see the take off of Doc Hollywood, which is not a problem in my books because Doc Hollywood was a nice film.<br /><br />In Cars we have Lightning McQueen a rookie race car with an attitude who sees himself as the next best thing since sliced bread.  Not only does he know it, he advertises it too so he's not really a likable character.<br /><br />He is so sure of himself he is more than happy to speed on the on the road, in his arrogance he thinks he is above the law so he when he crashes into the Hill Billy town of Radiator Springs and ends up causing lots of damage he is not too happy to be sentenced to do community service to pay his debt to society.<br /><br />Lightning isn't a happy car and he all he wants to do is get away from Radiator Springs but that is going to be easier said than done and you are not sure if community service is going to make any difference to Lightning whose dreams are of the big city, lights fame and racing.<br /><br />There is a star studded cast of voices, and they do a pretty good job, Paul Newman is great as the wise old Doc Hudson and you can't help smiling at Ramon, voiced by Cheech of Cheech and Chong.<br /><br />All in all a nice little film like I said earlier, quirky and fun but nothing spectacular when I think of other animated movies I have seen over the years, not really worth going to the movies to see unless you are a real fan of Disney/Pixar, and I guess the big screen does it justice but personally I'd wait for it to come out on DVD.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	very funny<br />it will take your mind off of the problems of the world.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I must admit that I greeted HP and the Deathly Hallows Pt I with mixed emotions: Great excitement and anticipation to finally see the film version of what I consider to be the best book of the series and a lot of sadness to know that this meant that Harry Potter was actually at an end.<br />After having been extremely disappointed with the film version of HP and the Half Blood Prince, I sincerely hoped that this film would be better than expected and it did not disappoint. The scene of Hermione wiping her parents memories and leaving home had me in tears in just the first few minutes of the movie. And then just a few minutes later, the death of Hedwig during the flight from Privet Drive brought me to tears again.<br />This movie included all the important parts of the book while leaving out some of the parts that dragged on a little too long (the many nights on the run in the countryside of England) And the ending of Part I, where Harry, Ron and Hermione are caught by the Snatchers left me breathless with anticipation for Part II.<br />Any Harry Potter that has not yet seen this movie (is that even possible?) should definitely get the video and watch it before Part II arrives in the theatres in July of 2011. You will wish you had seen the film earlier and be anxious for the final film.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	thought maybe I missed something - so I picked up the DVD. I didn't miss much. It's an awful film that looks great. Rourke gives a stunning performance. Too bad it was in such a waste of time film. I liked the books by the way...but a load of the dialogue comes off as ridiculous when it's said out loud rather than being filtered by your brain in context of  paneled art. Glad that people dig it, maybe this kind of stylized film can be built around a good screenplay. Did I mention the music gave me a headache?
B0006989TE	5.0	b	A small village that lies in a valley surrounded on all sides by a thick wood seems to be an idyllic and beautiful place to settle. But secrets and danger abound. Something lives in the woods, something seems to mean the villagers harm, and the town elders seem to know more about it than they are willing to say. Meanwhile, a love triangle is forming amidst the youth of the village...which leads to a shocking brutality. Can young blind Ivy face her fears and enter the woods to save the man she loves?<br /><br />I really enjoyed The Village. I would consider it my favorite M. Night movie...and I have seen them all. They are all deep, if you know what I mean. If you don't, I mean that they all deal with so much more than the issue at hand...and the theme is not always apparent to everyone. I would recommend this movie more for romance lovers than horror fans...I didn't find it very scary at all. I hope, although I doubt, that M. Night will make a sequel...or a prequel...or both.<br /><br />Kudos to Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce, who played Ivy Walker! She really made the movie...I could see her becoming a big Hollywood leading lady.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	There have been many good adaptations of comic book stories coming to theatres lately; it's truly a golden age for the super hero on the silver screen.  Iron Man is an enjoyable addition to this growing catalog of films, but it could have been truly outstanding with a few additions.<br /><br />The basic story is about a great industrialist who gets out of weapons manufacturing and into costumed heroism, having a change of heart after he spends some time imprisoned by warlords who have been acquiring his company's weapons.  This character turn had the potential to become preachy and obnoxious, but the movie wisely limits the peacenik blabbering to one minor character encountered early in the film.<br /><br />The movie underutilizes its two best assets: Tony Stark, and the suit.  Iron Man's combat suit is quite impressive, is equipped with a wide assortment of weapons, and seems to have enormous potential for elaborate action scenes.  Unfortunately, there is really only one scene in which we see him use the suit to its full capacity.  The film would have benefitted from one more big action sequence at that point in the story, or at least extending the scene we do have.  As for the man inside the suit, the character of Tony Stark is quite entertaining to watch when he's free to exchange verbal barbs with another character, or when he is let loose to adopt the larger-than-life billionaire playboy persona.  However, when he is constrained to trudge through plot-advancing dialogue, or when he has to share a more personal moment with another character, he seems to lose all his charm in an instant.<br /><br />But hey, if my biggest complaint is that I wanted more of a good thing, the movie must be doing alot of things right.  I solidly recommend it.<br /><br />PQ:<br />Blu-Ray picture quality was very good.  The only distracting digital noise I observed was when we see from a point-of-view inside the suit, which was clearly deliberate.  The daytime exterior shots are very nice, showing plenty of detail.  The dark, interior shots are not as impressive, but I've yet to see any movie on Blu-Ray that handled them perfectly.  Overall I would say the picture quality on the Blu-Ray is quite good, similar to (and maybe just a touch better than) Spiderman 3.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Before I purchased Food, Inc. I always wanted to know the process of the foods I eat especially meats. I wanted to know what cows and chickens were being fed,I wanted to know more about corn and why it is used in almost everything that I eat, I also wanted to know more on antibiotics and animals.<br /><br />Everything that I wanted to know and so much more I found out by watching Food, Inc.<br /><br />I really understand the importance of eating meats, fruits and vegetables that are organic.<br /><br />Thanks to Food, Inc. I now know how to eat healthier and where to shop for healthy foods.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	It wasn't terrible.  I guess I just expected more.  I was quite disappointed with the ending though.  Why is it that Snow White doesnt end up with the Huntsman?  Makes no sense to me when they set it up for them to be together - I mean geez he is true love's kiss.  Just saying, that should have been thought out more.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This movie reveals the truth of the practices of the way our food is raised and produced.  We have been living in a fantasy and thinking that our food comes from nice and friendly family farmers when in most cases this is not the case.  This movie really opened my eyes and as a result my family and I have started making many changes to the way we approach food.  I look forward to more information and to more people making decisions that will cause the big companies to change their practices!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is an absolute MASTER of his trade. I bought the DVD for myself, showed it to my family, and 9 out of 10 people ended up crying from laughter!
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"Like everyone else I waited years to see this.  Life intervened, missed it at the theater, and had to wait a few more months to get this on DVD.<br /><br />While I loved the references to the earlier films (especially the ""Raiders"" warehouse with a cameo by the Ark itself) Spielberg went a little overboard with this.  The 1950s setting is contrived and forced. We get headshots of Marcus and Sallah on Dr. Jones' desk that are supposed to be contemporary snapshots, but are obvious stills from previous ""Jones"" films. The overall ambiance makes ""Happy Days"" a more accurate period piece.<br /><br />The worst part of #4 is that it's just plain boring.  No one cares about space aliens, er, inter dimensional beings.  The bad guys aren't really all that bad, and Cate Blanchett is just uncharacteristically uninteresting.  The last thing we needed of course was a young sidekick, and of course we get one (this is Spielberg after all).  The premise is that Indy is in his 50s, there's nothing wrong with that so why put in a gratuitous kid?<br /><br />There are some nuggets in here, but mostly it's fools gold. Sorry everyone."
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	This a dark turn even from original Snow White plots. Which I'm ok with but it was more graphic than I thought. Definitely for the more mature of 13 or older. I won't spoil anything else about this movie. Good actors. Dwarfs aren't really dwarf actors. Give the parts to the ones who fit the part
B002VRZEYM	2.0	b	Nothing but testimonials and no scientific backing at all. No double blind studies, and the evidence presented has been refuted by reputable scientists. So I am sorry if you watch this movie expecting to confirming your already biased opinions look elsewhere. Look it up, study it not everything in this documentary is wrong but some of the evidence presented has already been been refuted. Dig deeper and make sure your sources are from non-biased sources. You will find that many of the claims in the movie are just flat out unjustified by real science. Now don't get me wrong I hate big corporations, but I just not going to buy into claims that are not factually justified.
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	Perhaps I heard too much praise for this movie from others before I watched it, but it did not live up to my expectations.<br /><br />While the action scenes were great, the rest of the movie was often slow. The ending action sequence was disappointing. It was action for the sake of action and didn't quite work. My husband and I laughed, not in a good way, at the action scenes in the end and earlier when Pepper Potts helped Tony Stark change the device in his chest. Talk about cheesy.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr was awesome. Jeff Bridges, until the end, which I already mentioned was very good too.<br /><br />Terrance Howard's and Gwyneth Paltrow's characters could have been played by just about anyone. They both have talent but were not used effectively. Gwyneth was treated more like a Bond girl but one with no charisma. Terrance's character was bland. Gwyneth's was too cold and unapproachable. All she seemed to do was to walk around in tight dresses with big high heels. Boring. There was a glimmer of a good actress in there but as played, they could have substituted any model for her role.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	....is now on DVD.<br /><br />The most disheartening thing is to watch Harrison Ford amble so stiffly through the production. His responses are slow pivots. There is no tension or suspense to speak of.<br /><br />The Phantom Menace aside, this is the greatest validation for the The Beatles never having attempted a reunion.<br /><br />You can't go home again.<br /><br />(Unless you own the Ruby Red slippers, which - ironically - Spielberg does. Oh well, I guess he forgot to click his heels three times.....)
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"I'm sorry but this movie is a failure in my mind and I know the fans of the franchise are going to crucify me for this review but we have to call a spade a spade.  Btw, I'm a huge fan of the Alien franchise and of the Alien vs Predator franchise.<br /><br />PROS<br />- It's a class A movie<br />- Fantastic special effects<br />- Great actors<br /><br />CONS<br />- Unbelievable actions by supposed rational people (forgivable in horror movies where victims are dumb teenagers in a cabin in the woods but not forgivable in a science fiction expedition filled with supposed brilliant people)...yes, let's land and immediately run off into the alien pyramid, let the robot uncontrolably flip every switch out there that does god knows what with alien technology, then immediately take our helmets off (sure what could possibly be in the air!?), then proceed to play with the vats of alien goo that (we don't know are highly mutagenic, again because we don't take any time to act like real scientists!) and then let them spill onto enedmic life forms,  then because we didn't take time to look at the weather or because the pyramid triggered a storm (we don't know, because we don't take any time to act like scientists) we rush back to the ship barely make it, then back at the ship we start to expermient on a dead engineer head (the supersmart aliens that build humanity and the scary aliens) and we just dive into immediately experimenting on it vs cataloging and preserving and in the process of trying to reanimate it (god knows why) they cause it to blow up and splatter everywhere, after that we get drunk while the existentially demented two dimensional robot poisons one of us with the same mutagenic substance and back at the pyramid the two unlikeliest people to die in the pyramid (the two scientists who actually created and have the map!!!)..get lost precisely in the pryamid becaused they were too scared of the dead aliens ...then when those same scientists find a very alive mutated worm alien, they think it's perfectly ok to try to pet the snake(be afraid of dead aliens that look human but be friendly towards aggressive super strong snake looking alien, sure)...then all hell breaks loose, zygotes conveniently begin to mutate everywhere and even one poisoned crew member impregnates a second crew member with an alien baby....in an effort to remove the alien baby from her womb, one lady almost does surgery on herself and then two seconds later is running around fighting aliens and nobody seems to be shocked at all at her stapled and bloody abdomen!....oh did I mention that they find an alien engineer (the supersmart alien) in suspended animation....while this mess is going on, I have a great idea, lets wake him up!!! Sure, what other idiotic thing could we do?<br /><br />- Unbelievable actions by the robot ( in the original Alien movie the robot didn't care about the crew, he was programed by the weyland corporation to get an alien....in this movie the CEO of the corporation is onboard and his daughter and still the robot doesn't seem to care about safeguarding them, the robot seems to be running some aberrant existentialism program without regard for the safety of his CEO....c'mon you'd think the CEO would have had the thing programmed to not endanger him or his daughter....I know I would've).  Throughout the movie the robot does things that go contrary to direct orders from his human owners.  At no point in time is the robot sent back for diagnostics or for repairs....don't open that door!...oops the Robot says as it opens the door.  Even after the robot tries to put the pregnant with alien baby woman into stasis to be shipped back hom, you'd think that the pregnant lady would forever be distrustful of that robot.  No! she believes him whole heartedly later on in the movie.  Preposterous.  If the robot is malfunctioning, have his memory wiped and reprogram the thing until it follows basic commands!  As a child, if I broke the sugar jar and spilled the sugar after being told specifically by my parents to stop playing with the sugar jar...there were consequences!! Also the robot seems to have a basic knowledge of how to operate some things on the alien pyramid....was this knowledge also passed down through DNA to humans who built our earth stone age structures with the same user interface???? Only here the Robot seems to barely know enough to really screw things up really badly.....the robot is like an existentially demented 5 year old trying to grapple with his humanity....and at every turn his human masters seem to think that it's ok for the robot to be mucking around in what is perhaps the biggest archaeological find that humanity has EVER encountered!!  This robot creation is the very worst thing to have around in such a significant potentially dangerous environment.<br /><br />- Unbelievable aliens that grow super fast, are super aggressive, love flesh, don't need food, and have acid for blood. And the aliens aren't even cool.  They're like proto aliens.  At the end of the movie you get a glimpse of something that looks like the alien we know and fear but even this alien is proto version of the alien we know.....only the aliens we know existed on earth thousands of years before and one was even kept for game by the predator aliens in one avp movie....so why go proto?  to show us how the mutagenic goo has the power to convert every living thing out there into a self destructive bioweapon that bleeds acid?  Interesting novelty, but frankly would've been more impressed with cool looking and really scary aliens....like from the first movie!!<br /><br />- A complete incompetence by the Weyland corporation in how they fund and pursue this expedition with utter disregard for the mountain of information that they have on what could potentially be out here....in other movies the wetland corporation winds up being involved and aware of high tech aliens and even the deadly ALIENs. Yet, they send out this sloppy expedition, virtually unarmed, uninformed, untrained, crewed by the cheapest guys money can buy....and with a buggy robot that seems to be existentially demented acting like a 5 year old and by human masters who seem to be ok with letting the robot do whatever it darn well pleases even if it severely endangers the crew....seriously?  I'm supposed to buy this?  As soon as I saw the crew, I could tell you the order they were going to die in to the woman.  And the stereotypes.....just disrespectful.<br /><br />- Inaccurate scientific facts.  They say that the atmosphere is 71% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 3% carbon dioxide and they call this level of carbon dioxide poisonous.  No, actually it's not.  Carbon dioxide is not a poison AND at those levels some people might exhibit a mild headache from displaced oxygen but 3% is no where near dangerous and it is not a poison.  Get your basic science right!  If I can't trust you with the basic foundations of science then its harder to make that leap to believe your mutagenic goo theories. :-)<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I found myself saying, ""this is dumb, why are these supposed smart people doing such dumb things.""  I can accept honest mistakes by characters to help keep the plot going.  I can even suspend disbelief and accept that these aliens grow fast and are super aggressive.  In a teen horror movie, I can accept that the teens are dumb.  However, in a movie like Prometheus....I expect better much much better and I didn't get it.  The special effects were great but the special effects people do great work in hollywood these days.  The writing was sloppy.  The characters were sloppy.  The research into the previous films was woven in sloppily. Even the attempt at philosophy was sloppy.  Many of the special effects scenes appear to be sloppily lifted from other movies....yes we noticed guru tech special effects dude, we noticed that too....there are millions of us. We also noticed that the holo tech on the weyland ship looked eerily the same as the alien ship....you'd think that our holographic technology would be different from theirs, at least use another color and weave in elements from the 1979 film into this human ship.  No lets portray all technology in the same bluish slick way.  Sorry guys take your advice, nature doesn't build in straight lines and our technology is not going to look like some alien's technology from thousands or millions of years ago.  Oh and doubtful that aliens would've imprinted a calling card in our DNA that makes us draw maps that point back to a weapons facility and that the DNA trigger of such compulsion to draw the map only manifests to compulsively make humans map a course to the super secret weapons lab only during the human Stone Age!.....Wouldn't we find that compulsive pattern in the bathroom graffiti of he Prometheus and bathrooms around the world and in every girls' high school doodle notebook throughout he ages?!!!  No guess not - only cavemen and stone age hawaiians wrote these magic symbols. Oh wasn't the anachronistic map in ancient civilizations, multi ethnic pyramid a theme in another avp movie, yes it was!...if this was an homage, it came out sloppy too!<br /><br />ANSWERING QUESTIONS<br />In the end, this movie tries to answer all the questions out there regarding the ALIEN film and it answers a lot but quite frankly as an astute audience member and fan of the franchise, I don't really need ALL the loose ends tied up.  I need and crave for the plot to be advanced in a more intelligent fashion than simply in a space horror movie which this movie is not.<br />C'mon guys don't make me wonder whether the people in hollywood are every bit as dumb and lazy as the characters in this movie.<br /><br />LAZY<br />To me the people who did this version of the movie were lazy.  I'm sorry. Not the special effects guys - they get an A+++.  The writers and storywriters were lazy I'm sorry.  You had a mountain of help.  FANTASTIC actors like Charlize.  A monumental global fan base.  The best special effects crews on the planet.<br /><br />And then you the very best you can come up with is the super slow Euro-philosophically limp beginning sequence of the movie <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y7U98W"">Sunshine [Blu-ray</a>] and then transmorf into Friday the 13th part 87.....to generate this LAZY sop of a story for me and expect me to rave about it?  NO! GET TO WORK or WE'LL GO ELSEWHERE!"
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I have now purchased this set for various friends and family. I found it to be informative but mostly I enjoyed the English language spoken as it was meant to be.....Excellent acting very believable characterization.<br />I highly recommend this DVD for your family enjoyment!
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	I kept putting off *Cars* because basically I don't care for NASCAR or any of that racing stuff.  However, when I saw *Cars* it wasn't so bad.<br /><br />When Lightning McQueen ties with 2 other cars in a racing competition, they must re-race at another location in California.  Overnight, while sleeping in a semi-truck, McQueen is lost in the middle of nowhere.  Not only is he lost but he's in trouble for damaging a road strip and is sentenced to repair the road.<br /><br />Trapped and angry about his potential loss of a championship and sponsorship, he soons learns that there's more to life than winning the cup.  He meets other cars and befriends them as well as getting interested with one of them.  Meanwhile, he discovers there's someone there that used to be a racer but has kept it a secret.<br /><br />Regardless of his friendship with everyone, McQueen still has to repair the road.  When he is done, he has to decide which is more important...the race or his new friends.<br /><br />Pixar still hasn't failed me.  Even though I'm not fond of car racing, *Cars* was still an entertaining watch.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Simply put if you are a history buff, especially an American Revolution history buff, this is a MUST SEE!<br /><br />The acting is great, the story is great, the production quality is great, etc, etc, etc.  GET IT!  WATCH IT!  LOVE IT!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I gave this as a gift to my husband and we both loved it. Very funny.
B002QZ1RS6	3.0	b	Insanity is a very intense and very good work out. However it is not good for people who have knee problems. I am very young, only 18, but i am a dancer and former long and triple jumper and naturally i have had some knee injuries in the past. While you can try to do the workouts and skip the ones that are high impact on your knees they, you would basically be skipping 15 mins of the entire 45 minute workout. No good. I recommend this to anyonw eho is physically capable because it really works. It's just not for me.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Brought this for my husband and he loves it.  It's really a cute movie.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	This retelling of the faery tale of Snow White and the Seven (not eight) dwarves. Everything is shades of grey and the only thing we can rely on is a rather angry performance by Theron (was the script written that way?). Hemsworth is a main strength and vehicle  that keeps the story moving forward, but unless he is fighting or providing exposition, he is just as underused as everyone else. But I don't fault any other actors (including Stewart) because this film suffers from a weak script. Great ideas, wonderful score and CGI... just a weak script.<br /><br />The special features are underplayed. We are treated with short featurettes focusing on the main characters. We have another on the generalities of the world, the Dark Forest, The Fae Forest. The troll, the dark fae guards of obsidian.The entire time I couldn't help but think of the faerie tales of the Brothers Grimm, and how easily comparable the film was. I should have figured - that was the mood and theme the crew was shooting for.<br /><br />And they didn't miss the mark by much at all. This is a great movie with great characters. I am not a fan of the script itself though. If you like dark fantasy, give this one a go!
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	I loved this movie. So much action and so much awesomeness. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies and fairytales. It was the best spin off this SnowWhite fairytale.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"""Iron Man"" is one of the best comic book adaptations to find its way to the big screen. With sharper dialogue than ""Spiderman"" 1 and 2 and more irreverent energy than Tim Burton's ""Batman"" films, which would be its only competition, this is pure fun and a great start to a superhero franchise. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a self-absorbed playboy industrialist and wunderkind of the arms industry. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile, he is kidnapped by a militant faction who insist that he build them one of his new-fangled weapons. Assisted by the Afghani doctor (Shaun Toub) who saved his life, Stark constructs a bullet-proof, firethrowing, flying suit of armor to use in his escape instead. Upon returning to the United States, Stark finds that his priorities have changed. He plans to take Stark Industries in the direction of energy technologies, not weapons, which doesn't sit well with his business partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges).<br /><br />As the first film in the franchise, ""Iron Man"" spends a lot of time on Stark's transformation. I never felt like the story was filler in between a bunch of overblown action sequences. The action never lasts very long. This is a good thing. It pushes the pace of the film while avoiding prolonged duels that can become tedious. I think it would be generous to call director Jon Favreau's previous work ""mediocre"", but I have to admit that ""Iron Man"" is a triumph. Favreau even successfully dealt with the challenge of making it interesting to watch someone build a machine or look at a computer screen. The key is that Stark is able to converse with his computer and make pithy comments to his robot while working. Not every actor would have been so amusing talking to himself, but Robert Downey, Jr. makes Tony Stark a lovable reformed rake. The film's only weakness is that Stark's leggy personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his military liaison Col. James Rhodes (Terrence Howard) seem to be there only for decoration.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2008 single disc): The only bonus features on the single disc edition are 11 deleted or extended scenes and a publicity spot (1 min) for the upcoming Iron Man animated series. Plus there is a short but sweet Easter Egg (2 min) in which ""Iron Man"" co-creator Stan Lee talks about Robert Downey Jr. and his cameo appearance in the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish,  French. Dubbing available in French and Spanish."
B0006989TE	2.0	b	"THE VILLAGE is perhaps reminiscent of an old Twilight Zone episode except that there's no Rod Serling to provide the laconic and wryly humorous introduction.<br /><br />The American village in question is set in the depths of a forest, apparently in the late 19th century. At first, it seems an idyllic settlement. But we soon learn that the trees harbor monsters that will ostensibly assault anyone foolish enough to venture beyond the well-defined (with torches and yellow flags) town perimeter into the undergrowth. As long as the human inhabitants stay within the prescribed limits, and don't allow the display of anything colored red - even flowers - the goblins will tolerate their presence according to some unspecified ""truce"". The community is ruled by a council of elders, chief among whom are Edward Walker (William Hurt) and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver). It's apparent the burg needs to chill out, perhaps with the help of a pub or two and a house of ill repute.<br /><br />The film's lead female character is Ivy Walker, appealingly played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Ivy is the blind, yet wise and plucky, young woman that falls for the lumpish and taciturn Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix). After the latter falls afoul of the village idiot, Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), and his knife, Ivy volunteers to traverse the dreaded wilderness to the next town for the medicines that will save her beloved. (Why nobody from a neighboring town ever travels to the home village is ever explained.) It's on this quest that the audience discovers the true nature of the village and its besiegers.<br /><br />The morale of the story is that Man's fears can be self-created, yet can be otherwise useful in keeping the population at large in psychological thrall, like the Red Menace of the Cold War era reported by the government to be poised to rape Mom and pillage the apple pie of the Free World, or the Bogey Man under the bed postulated by parents to keep unruly offspring under control.<br /><br />Admittedly, the ending to THE VILLAGE did cause me to slightly raise an eyebrow in deference to a mildly clever twist, but the lead-up to it was too long and unengaging to ultimately justify the viewing experience."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	The Departed is a great gangster film, and a return to form for Scorsese.  Sit back and enjoy the the show.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I absolutely love this film.  It has attention to detail that is unbelievable.<br /><br />The backgrounds and art is beautiful.  I also found Mater<br /><br />added a lot of fun to the story.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	My husband & I just finished the movie and we both totally loved it!  Yeah, we were both in tears at the end!  First movie I've ever seen that focuses on real life struggles of marriage.  Any married couple can relate to this film one way or another.  Had to rush to my computer to purchase ASAP!!
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"Prometheus of mythology brought fire and changed the world. Prometheus of Ridley Scott brought ""ehh"" and occupied me for a few hours.<br /><br />Are there some stunning visuals? Sure, enough for PC slideshow, but not a whole movie. And please, can we broaden the color palate just a tad? I mean I saw Minority Report, I'm ready for more than blue-grey.<br /><br />The story has interesting moments and some big-ish ideas, but not a lot more than a re-run of ""In Search of ..."".<br /><br />And if you can remove characters from the movie without leaving any real absence, you should. Sorry Vickers, you're out of here. (""But she has a difficult relationship with her father!"" Wow, high drama.)<br /><br />OK, some fun, some cool graphics, but the sum of the original Thing from Another Planet (similar alien confrontation), 2001 a Space Oddity (Have some Champagne, Dave), Alien, last King Kong (bug attack), and other sci-fi films and TV shows does not a classic make. Just more derivative fodder.<br /><br />Addition: I just have to add that for all of it's weaknesses, and it had MANY, I think Event Horizon did a better job of drawing interesting characters and tension than Prometheus. Ouch."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Wow, I very much enjoyed this movie, and it arrived intact and on time. I stayed up till 4am watching this movie. I hope they make another one sometime soon. Those of you who enjoy Fantasy type of movie this one is deffinitly for you. If you read comic books on these topics then you are so going to enjoy this as well.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	People who want easy answers will be unsatisfied, but this visual spectacle had more intellectual meat than most movies, sci fi or otherwise.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Saw this at midnight and I can not wait for the dvd! I LOVED IT! I hate that the only reason people are hating is because of the whole scandal. The scandal had nothing to do with thd movie get over it people! Charlize was AMAZING! Kristen and Chris were also good but nothing compares to Charlize's acting in this film she practically stole the film. I thought this movie was great
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I liked it,good speical effects.Great action,drama and romance a little bit of everything.I found the movie to be very entertaining.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	Good movie out of an even better book. McCarthy is one of the best living writers, and the Coen's do a good job, but don't match his artistry. Well worth owning though.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	"Warner Brothers is trying to fool us again - calling this an ""Ultimate Edition"" when it is NOT the extended version of the film.  It comes with behind the scenes extras and commentaries, but the movie itself is the same!  I expect this is because they decided after the first 2 Ultimate Editions that they would wait and re-release all 8 movies at once in another Ultimate Edition, but this time a Box Set with extended versions of all films - to entice everyone to buy all the movies yet again. Hold off for now and watch your DVD copies - next year we can all buy the REAL Ultimate Editions!"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I have seen True Blood 1 and 2 and will buy the next one when the price comes down - please....these prices are laughable.  True Blood, in my estimation is better than all the Twilight movies and any other Vampire, etc. series or movies ever were.  The difference is that True Blood has HEART - you learn to love the players.  I can't stand Kristen's character in the movies--she's like a stone and Robert isn't much better.  I think True Blood has the better stories, the better characters and all around is worth a BIG FIVE STARS!!!! but I'd give them 10!!<br />Sherrie Holtz
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"We love the fun story line and heart-warming lesson to ""Believe"" in our hearts of the symbols of Christmas.  Our 2 1/2 year old so loves the ""Train Movie"" too.  We love how the movie animation follows the animation in the book which is another favorite of ours."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I think that this movie was awesome!!!  I laughed almost to the point of crying throughout the whole thing. My son and I love it so much and we've watched it so many times that he now knows it almost by heart!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	it is the most heart felt animation i have ever seen in a christmas movie it peeks the imaganation of kids as well adults and make you think what christmas is all about as well as the music it takes me back to my childhood
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I am completely satisfied with the condition and timeliness of the product arrival.I will continue to purchase from Amazon because it is dependable.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"This is a strange case: the movie is not based in the comic... IT IS THE COMIC. Here, in Mexico, Grupo Editorial Vid published the series almost 5 years ago and every comic-reader was shocked. Even now, I have a friend who hates comic-books and still, she falled in love with this one. That says a lot about the movie so for me, it's the best ""comic-movie"". I know it's full of violence but in the end, the movie is about love and frienship. How bad could it be that? Please, check it out and try to watch it with your mind open. Maybe you'll fin a big surprise."

B0006989TE	2.0	b	"That's about it... this was perhaps a made-for-tv-movie at best that somehow either got rejected by the networks, or was forced onto the screen by corporate pressure.<br /><br />It starts of decent enough, and gets you hooked for the first 30 minutes, however after that, it's downhill, predictable and full of too many questions and confusions to be worth it.  Some questions (which will not give away the silly ending) You mean this is the FIRST time that someone in this village was in desperate need of medical attention?  If they are limited to living within the clearing from the woods, how do they get more wood and firewood?  If we are to believe that actual monsters roam the woods and are THAT much of a threat, why are the watchmen teenage boys at best?  A village of at least 20-30 males who have axes, clubs and other weapons at their disposal, against what, a few porcupine looking pig-monsters, and they haven't killed the monsters yet!?  An entire town talks day and night about ""The things which cannot be mentioned or talked about."", oh yeah, that's got me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Interesting idea, but extrememly poorly presented.  And what happened during the last 30 minutes? Did someone finally realize they were running out of film and shouted out..""Let's end this thing... dinner is ready!""  If you are going to give away the ending of the film, why do it with 40 minutes left in the film?  Now we are forced to sit and wait for a climatic ending... which never comes.<br /><br />The acting was poor because the entire village all had the same acting script;  Everyone beahves lethargic and polite and act like the guy standing next to you.<br /><br />The best part of this movie was when you actually thought there were monsters coming after them, that took up 5 minutes tops in this movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your money, see it on TV and pray they cut out a bunch of it that was utterly useless."
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"Well, we now have five years of Harry Potter's life on DVD, and what a stunning year ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" was, visually.  Yes, I said visually.  David Yates did an AMAZING job putting this film together.  The visual effects were stunning.  The sets and locations were brilliant as usual.  The young cast has grown into fine performers, and the adult cast continues to shine.  The music fit the world perfectly and the costumes were great.  Yet, there was one disappointment with film and I wouldn't consider that large on a grand scale.  It was the adaption.<br />J. K. Rowling's fifth novel is pivotal and continues to change Harry's life in dark ways.  It was amazing, and Ms. Rowling created one of the most hated characters ever.  That character is Professor Umbridge.  I consider it a mark of great pennmanship if an author is able to create a character that is ment to be hated and actually hated when read.  I don't find many authors capable of that quality.  Imelda Staunton did a wonderful job of bringing Umbridge to life in the movie.  The problem with the movie was that it was too darn short in comparison to the novel.  Too much of the story was cut out of the movie.  The film makers should have split this film into two.<br />Many people think that the novel of ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" was boring and slow.  I disagree.  There were so many fun, and entertaining moments in the novel that would have been great in the movie, even if they didn't have much to do with the greater plot.  Quidditch is one example.  It is a fun little part of the world Ms. Rowling created and the fans love it.  The makers of the film should have included it in the film for the fans' sake.  The end of the film was also lacking.  The majority of the O.W.L.S. sequence at the end of the novel, especially the Astronomy part, was one of my favorite parts of the film.  The complete Ministry of Magic sequence at the end of the novel would have been another cool part to add into the movie for it would have added some more action to the lacking film.<br />On the upside, the Dumbledore's Army scenes were stunning and perfect.  They were exactly as I imagined them and added a slight but entertaining dimension to slow film.  The fight against the Death Eaters and Voldemort at the end (while too short in length) was more amazing than I could have imagined.  If you want to see stunning ""the best"" wizards at work, then watch the Ministry of Magic sequence at the end of the film.  Speaking of the MOM, the set for it was stunning, and is one of my favorite in the entire series.<br />In the end, I gave this film four stars out of five, just because it's Harry Potter.  This film also earned points on every front except the story.  I highly recomend it if you are interested in stunning visual effects, great music, good actors, and a fan of the Harry Potter series.  It really is a great movie, for the most part."
B001KEGR8Y	2.0	b	This dvd and comedian didn't do it for me.  Nothing funny here.  I probably won't try again with a different performance.  Not my type of humor.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT! This movie is unbelievable, everyone should see it if you really take care about your & your family healthy life. It is very important & urgent! My family already start to use organic food & you would be surprised how it tests, it is so delicious, something totally different! It is true that this food is expensive but it is worth it, you loose money but you are going to save them on not seeing doctors & not buy medicine. I wish everybody would watch this movie because if you know what is going on & who is responsible for that then we can do something together to live better & be peaceful about our children's feature!!!
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	I'm big on darker storylines.  I'm not a die hard fan of the Potter franchise.  I never watched them in the big screen.  I always wait for it on video.  Watching this on Blu Ray is awesome.  I can't wait for the last two movies.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	I was ecstatic when I first heard of this version.  After seeing it, I am a huge fan.  The well-written and acted drama/fantasy is carried by Theron and Stewart's performances.  Theron's queen is an evil but pitiful tragic character who emotes loathing and sympathy within minutes.  Her life is a sad one which has made her a man-hater, bitter, and cursed.  Stewart's Snow White is a young woman with a heart and a flame of hope.  She is not a wimp but not yet the warrior leader that she is destined to be.  The film looks bleak when it needs to be and colorful when hope springs up.  Overall, it is a grand adventure for the eyes and the soul.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Insanity is an amazing workout and it will get you  results, however this is a tough program and it is not for people that are really out of shape or have not worked out in a while. These individuals should start off with somthing less intense first. Insanity is very intense, even the warmup is tiring.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	This movie was purchased primarily as a gift.  Viewed it with my son, had a blast!  He wanted to see it, but was ill when the movie was playing in the theaters.  We are going to go see Iron Man II tomorrow night!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	This is a good movie and it keeps you guessing the entire time.  Nothing is as it seems.<br />I loved it.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	went and saw it in theaters and it was one long boring let down.<br /><br />previews looked awesome  only good parts in the movie were the previews,
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"Sin City is a visually striking film. It fully succeeds in capturing the feel of the graphic novel it is based on and of Film Noir in general. The acting is also good, within the limitations of the comic book-style chosen by the film-maker. The interlinked stories are well told. Some of the comments of previous reviewers are, however, puzzling. For example, in a film which is filled with eye-gouging, torture, mutilations, and amputations, not a few reviewers found time to comment on the ""graphic nudity"", which consisted of a couple of brief, shadowy shots of breasts. One aspect of American Culture I have always found puzzling is the propensity to view the most ghastly and sadistic forms of violence as ""good wholesome entertainment"" while a glimpse of an exposed nipple on television sends the whole nation into hysterics. Don't get me wrong, I love this country, but that is a bit of a paradox. A second odd comment I've seen concerns the supposed mysogyny of this film. Yes, most of the female characters are prostitutes, but the film is about the underbelly of society. Most of these women are portrayed as intelligent, strong, and perfectly capable of defending themselves. They are actually shown in a far more positive light than any of the male characters, who are almost universally portrayed as brutal, sadistic cavemen who are apparently obsessed with attacking other men's genitals. If anything, the film is more anti-male (mysandrous?) than mysogynistic."
B0006989TE	4.0	b	Nay-say what you will, M. Night Shyamalan is consistent in his apparent mission to encourage his audience to look beyond the obvious to discover aberrant alternatives to the explanation of nature, including humans and their motivations.  THE VILLAGE is a very good movie if taken as another chapter in Shyamalan's odyssey.  If it doesn't have the shock jolt that his early successful film THE SIXTH SENSE had, then perhaps it is more because we as audience are beginning to understand his take on reality versus the unknown.<br /><br />The village of the title suggests a cult community of people dressed in 19th century garb, living off the land, abhorring money and its evil influence on mankind, and maintaining a status of coexistence with Those We Do Not Speak Of whose domain is the woods surrounding the plot of land designated for the villiage. We learn that each of the villagers has a personal dark secret that defines the reason for the establishment of the commune away from the 'world'.  There is an Amish flavor in dress and speech and government that makes this strange place appealing.  The villagers have all taken an oath not to cross the line into the woods to go to the 'towns' beyond.  It is this schism that is challenged in the story and the results of the individual will to risk because of the all-important concept of Love that is the journey through which Shyamalan guides us.<br /><br />The cast includes Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter in a fine first performance as the blind heroine), Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Cherry Jones, Michael Pitt and Adrien Brody and they do well with the rather stiff script they are given (the odd 19th century versus 21st century method of speaking is but one of the clues to Shyamalan's secret ending).  The photography is lovely, moody, and atmospheric and the haunting solo violin playing by Hilary Hahn of the score by James Newton Howard contribute elegantly to enhancing the mood of the film.<br /><br />No, this is not a great movie, but taken for what it is - another step toward the mystery of the universe conundrum - it succeeds well, at least to this viewer.  Grady Harp, January 2005
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	I had to break watching this movie into three parts because I could not sit through it all in one go.<br /><br />The arguments presented are nonsensical, the 'witty' commentary is often merely illogical but actually crosses over into being non sequitur in a few places.  For a movie 'about science', nothing but opinion is presented; and that opinion is largely not even presented as part of an argument: you just get hit with disconnected opinion after disconnected opinion.  To the extent the movie does present any kind of cohesive message, it seems to be that 'ID deserves a seat at the table, no matter what, always.'  But it is so muddled with dejected ex-academic staff, an apparently pointless segment on eugenics and Nazism, heavy editing and so on, that even that gets a little lost.<br /><br />And then the whole thing ends on a speech about freedom, which (a) has nothing to with science and (b) doesn't mean the 90% of people who disagree with you have to listen/respect/pay you.  It was there at the beginning too... which is what I think the script may have originally focused on, before some kind of wholesale but not complete revision.  Maybe?<br /><br />I watched this both because I figured I'd get a better idea of ID arguments are and to see how it represented current evolutionary theory.  This movie failed in both respects --unless that really is all there is to ID.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	As an American History teacher, I loved this miniseries because it didn't romanitcize the era in which it was filmed.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	Even if you accept the basic premise of the movie, how can you escape the fact that these people would have had to see planes and helicopters periodically flying over their 19th century village, no matter how isolative they tried to be?  What if they would have seen jet contrails high in the sky?  It's preposterous to think that the younger people born into the village wouldn't find those things strange.  I was disappointed by this movie.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"This is exactly what I expected from the man who brought us Goodfellas. Scorsese has created a masterpiece and its name is The Departed. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much walking into the theaters to see it, mostly due to the actors who star (DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Mark Wahlberg), but because of all the good things I had been hearing I decided to see it. ""Wow."" Was all I could say as I left the theater (same reaction from my two buds who tagged along) and called damn near everyone I knew who enjoyed a good movie. After this film I see all of the before mentioned actors in a whole new light. This film is definitely at the top of my favorites list!"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"""Iron Man"" is a really fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Casting Robert Downey Jr as the very personality flawed billionaire military weapons manufacturer Tony Stark was just perfect.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, the movie follows the transformation of Tony Stark from selfish (not sure he actually changes much there) playboy to a full fledged Marvel Superhero (but as Pepper says, ""You are NOT a superhero"").<br /><br />Obviously this type of movie requires some suspension of disbelief, but the humor, action, and special effects keep the little issues way in the back of your mind.<br /><br />A very enjoyable movie, Highly Recommended!"
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	We can not deny the truth or stop searching for the truth just because it is inconvenient.  Refusing to admit that we do not know it all and can not find answer to everything is false, presumptuous and lead us to frustration, hate and self destruction as well as destruction of others.<br />This movie/documentary is searching the truth, asking questions that man has ask since the beginning of time but most of all denounce the injustice done to men and women who, in their line of work, ask or open the door to others to seek answer. We all have the natural law inside of us.  We all know what is wrong or right in our heart, we either listen or suppress. We are all individually LOVED by our Creator, GOD, we are each one of us unique, and each of us has different gifts to share either as a scientist, doctor, teacher, researcher in a laboratory ... and no one should take away what GOD has given, free will, from an other.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Jeff is really the best in his business.  When you watch his act, he really makes you believe his puppets are real.  You may find yourself saying: ""Hey Walter was really funny.""  I have seen Jeff in person about six times and he always delivers.  If you haven't seen him live or he doesn't perform in your area, this is almost as good."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS MY OPINION DESIGNED TO HELP THOSE WHO HAVEN'T SEEN OR PURCHASED THE MOVIE--YOUR MILAGE MAY VARY. IF YOU WANT INFO ON PICTURE/SOUND AND EXTRAS SKIP TO THE THIRD AND FOURTH PARAGRAPHS.<br /><br />THIS REVIEW IS ON THE TWO DISC SET. THE ONE DISC SET PRIMARILY HAS THE FEATURE FILM<br />THANKS!<br /><br />""Titanium Composite Man"" just doesn't have the same ring to it as ""Iron Man"". Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr. in a terrific, complex and amusing performance)is ""The Merchant of Death"" building his father's company into a juggarnaut defense company. His latest defense system the Jericho can crush the enemy. When Stark is kidnapped on his way back from a demonstration the injured Stark is forced to build a home made version of Jericho. With bits of metal in his heart kept from killing him due to the ingenuity of another captor, Stark literally has a change of heart--particularly when he sees the bad guys have HIS weapons.<br /><br />He uses the crude tools to build a suit of metal that can protect him and attack his captors as needed. Stark finds himself reenergized and with his new miniature arc reactor powering the magnet that keeps him alive, he sets out to undo some of the damage his company has done by coming Iron Man. Standing in his way is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges superb as usual)who wants the company to run as usual and Stark even gets flak from his stauch supporters Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow)and Col. Rhodes (Terence Howard).<br /><br />The DVD looks brilliant--it's one of the sharpest transfers I've seen to date with colors that pop and some of the best details/clarity I've seen. It's one of the top notch transfers  I've seen in recent years. Audio is extremely active and is well used to put you into metal head's world.<br /><br />The extras are stunning as well. We get a full documentary ""I AM Iron Man"" that details all aspects of production giving us a glimpse into everything from pre-CGI work, design elements to on-the-set wire work involving Robert Downey, Jr. Director Jon Favreau (who also plays Happy in the film)manages to seamlessly combine CGI with pratical physical effects such as puppets and the men in suits. His visual effects and physical effects team (from Stan Winston Studios)blend things so well that there were some shots that I could have sworn were physical effects but turned out to be CGI and vice versa. We also get deleted/extended scenes that are interesting but prove that Favreau made the right choice in cutting the bulk of them out. There are also stills galleries, screen test, a featurette ""Invincible Iron Man"" that gives us an idea about the development of the character with interviews featuring many of the Marvel bullpen who contributed to metal head's development, ""Wired"" which provides us background on the physical effects/visual effects of the film.<br /><br />Director Favreau manages to keep the fun comic book elements of the story and still attach a serious but entertaining element to the film resulting in one of the summer's best blockbusters. It may lack the darkness of ""The Dark Knight"" (that ""Iron Man"" is really Marvel's idea of ""Batman"" but a bit of irony thrown in for good measure except involving more advanced technology)but the alternating tone of the film makes it an enjoyable companion piece to the best of the ""Spider-Man"" films directed by Sam Raimi.<br /><br />The nice thing about ""Iron Man"" is that it doesn't betray its roots but celebrates them (although it does transport the action which originally occurred in Vietnam to Afgan terrorities and also moves some characters around such as Stane for a stronger, more cohesnive narrative but still remains true to the spirit of the comic book).<br /><br />Marvel's first in-house production ""Iron Man"" demonstrates that the comic book turned movie company can do as good a job (if not better)at during their own material in terrific films that don't betray their origins. Just a reminder--after the credits roll DON'T turn off your TV or DVD player. There's a sequence that actually sets up what is said to be the third ""Iron Man"" film (or second depending upon who you hear it from)and has a companion piece clip at the conclusion of ""The Incredible Hulk"".<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	"I love Harry Potter, OK? So before you freak out, let me get that out of the way. The book version ""Order of the Phoenix"" was oustanding. I also think that previous directors have done pretty good to great jobs of translating the books to film (though I must say things went a little downhill once Chris Columbus left.)<br /><br />All that being said, here's the kicker:<br /><br />The movie ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" played like a Cliff's Notes adaptation of the book.<br /><br />It lopped off a lot of the charm and romance and heartfelt pathos of the book--- as well as a lot of the pure creative touches--- in order to get the main arc of the story down. On top of that, it made ""adaptations"" to the book in order to get the story moving along--- yet all these ""compromises"" were actually worse than what JK Rowling originally wrote!<br /><br />Don't believe me? Here is only SOME of what is wrong with this movie:<br /><br />--Poor devlopment of the Harry/Cho Chang arc (The kiss is about all you get. No real feeling behind it at all. No devlopement of Harry's crush. No final break up argument on Valentine's Day.)<br />--Making Cho into an evil snitch (which is why she and Harry broke up in the movie.) In the movie SHE is the one who betrays Harry. Stupid.<br />--No hospital scenes. No meeting of Neville's parents.<br />--Perfunctory explanation of Grimmaud Place<br />--Perfunctory development of Occlumency<br />--Harry gets to hear the prophecy while standing in the Department of Mysteries rather than later with Dumbledore. On top of this, he gets to hear the prophecy just by holding it in his hand. That makes no logical sense at all!<br />--The Department of Mysteries itself is compressed down into one room (the room with the prophecies.) All the cool rooms (with the blue lights, the 12 doors, the clocks, the brains, and so on) are all just ignored. Those were such tremendous inventions by JK Rowling--perhaps some of the most creative stuff in all the books-- that I can't believe they just cut them!<br />--The room with the arch is made into a really boring place.<br />--The battle scene is really short and rather stupid.<br />--Snape's memory of being tortured by James Potter and his argument with Lily Potter is compressed into literally a total of 4 seconds of film. That scence is so PIVOTAL to the rest of the book series that I can't believe they got away with not fully developing the scene.<br /><br />On top of all these plot issues, the WORST part about this movie is that there was really no FEELING in it. The whole range of emotional arcs that are so well-developed in the book are done absolutely terribly in the movie. Yeah, Sirius dies. In the book, it is a devatating moment. In the movie, it's like ""Oh, well."" Harry, Ron and Hermione don't have many moments together. There is no laughing in the movie. We don't get to feel pathos for Neville because his parents are insane.  We don't get to feel the gratefulness of the Weasleys when Harry saves Mr Weasley.  There are no lighthearted moments. Almost every scene except one or two that could have developed the emotional attachment we feel to the characters has been summarily excluded.<br /><br />Like one other reviewer said: The movie is too short, yet it feels too long.<br /><br />That is, sorry to say, a perfect description of a hack job.<br /><br />I am quite disappointed."
B001684L0A	1.0	b	"The acting, dialogue, and pacing are all superb--credit the director and the actors for that. Where the movie falls down is in the camera work, which comes close to ruining the entire series. Apparently, no tripod was used for the camera work in this film. Instead, the point of view  is always moving--up,down,side to side. Imagine yourself in a movie theater, trying to enjoy the story unfolding on the screen before you, but the person next to you keeps bumping your shoulder, jarring the image in front of you, causing you to lose your concentration. That is the practical result of the camera shenanigans used in this movie. As a result, the viewer is never quite able to lose himself in the film. And that is a shame, for it is a compelling story. Instead, we are continually being ""bumped"" by an intruding Director of Photography. The camera work should never draw attention to itself, at least not to the exaggerated extent that it does in JA."
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	Great movie but nothing compared to the book.  Very sad in parts and a bit too graphic for teens when they try to smash the horcrux.  Can't wait for the next one.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff is by far the funniest comedian i have seen in a long long time.  He has great skills and can make anything funny.  If you haven't watched him yet you MUST see it.  I enjoyed both DVDs and can't wait for the Christmas special keep em comin Jeff.  Be prepared to laugh your A$$ off at this ingenious man for the entire show he alone his very funny but when the puppets come out it gets hilarious.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	I was so excited about seeing The Village. I go to one or two movies a week, because there is nothing else to do in the small town I live in. I've seen almost 40 movies this year, and by far The Village is the most disappointing movie of the year. The movie is nothing like what it's been sold and advertised on for the last six months.<br /><br /> The Village is supposed to take place in Covington,PA in 1897. the citizens of Covington live in a small valley surrounded by a forest. They can't leave the forest because of the beasts or &quot;They who we do not speak of&quot; live there.<br /><br /> The Studio and M. Night Shyamalan begged the critcs not to reveal anymore of the plot than that. I can see why they wanted that for a bunch of reasons. The movie has a lot of plot twists and the story takes some major changes. If you knew about the changes you probaly wont enjoy the movie as much. Or in my case If I had known I wouldn't have wasted my money.<br /><br /> The movie is sold as one of the scariest movies you will ever see. It's by far anything but that. That ideal really blew me off to the movie. For the last six months all we've seen in the trailers and advertising is how scary this is. I jumped once in the movie, and the crowd only reacted to four or five scenes total. It's wrong for a studio and director to trick people into coming in and seeing there weak political statement movie.<br /><br /> I did like Bryce Dallas Howard a lot in the movie. She was great as the blind girl Ivy Walker. She really runs with the movie and is brillant. She's funny in places and she's dramatic in others. It really is her movie. Joaquin Phoneix was great in the movie, well when he's in it. The guy can act and he's awesome, but this is a waste of his talents. William Hurt was also good as well. Adrien Brody wastes his Best Actor talents as the mentaly challenged Noah. Sigourney Weavers part isn't all that big either.<br /><br /> The sets in The Village were great. The town looks authentic and the forest is pretty cool. The costumes are bland and boring, I know they can't do much because Red is a forbidden color. They still could have done more to make the town look so less depressing. The music was pretty good as well.<br /><br /> The movie was to predictable. I guessed right almost all the major plot twists throughout the movie. I probaly would have enjoyed the movie more, except for the fact that I was expecting this big dramatic thriller, and it's nothing like that. The acting and sets are good in the movie, the story just kills it. If you like M. Night Shyamalan you really are going to be disappointed by this. This is the worst movie of the year. It's nothing like what it should be. Go save yourself some money and miss The Village.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	This movie was a real disappointment. I thought it would have been better then it was. I wouldn't waste my money on buying it. It was way too slow paced and stupid.
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	I desperately need to understand how this girl has a career as an actress. Seriously, will someone tell me? Surely she hasn't banged EVERY director she's worked with. Her excruciatingly dull performance not withstanding, the rest of the movie is kind of entertaining.The script is weak, but Charlize Theron is perfection as the queen. And the special effects are beautiful, but it's not enough to carry the film. Casting agents: There are a ton of talented young actresses out here. Try harder next time.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"*SPOILER ALERT*  A quick summary:*SPOILER ALERT*.  In GOF,Lord Voldemort wonderfully kills Robert Pattinson, sorry, Cedric Diggory and everyone thinks Harry killed him. In Order of the Phoenix, Harry meets the Order of the Phoenix, a secret club that protects the world from Lord Voldemort.  Hogwarts' new DADA teacher (Umbridge), refuses to let the students learn defense magic.  So, Harry, Ron, Hermione and the other students make a club of their own, Dumbledore's Army.  Harry get's his first kiss, get's posessed by Voldemort and all hell breaks lose.  Harry and Dumbledore's Army fly to the Ministry of Magic and Voldemort and Dumbledore get into a huge battle with water and fire, and Dumbledore wins for now.  The end!  Mind you, this is a short summary just to give you an idea on what the movie is about.  Also, there are a couple cute Ron and Hermione moments in this movie-for us shippers.<br /><br />The biggest complaints about the ""Harry Potter Ultimate Edition"" DVDs are that the movies are not shown in full.  You're just watching the theater version without all of the deleted scenes and such.  The reason all fans should buy this DVD is not because of the actual movie, because let's face it, fans have seen the movies probably well over 50 times each...  The reason to get this DVD is because of the bonus features, and of course, because it's a collectors item.<br /><br />I buy them because they feature tons of bonus stuff.  You get these oversized character cards, you get a little booklet that shows the concept art, you get this documentary that they filmed about the world of Harry Potter-they cut it into, I think, 5 or 7 parts and you get each part of the documentary with each movie.  I love the HP movies with a passion, and ever since David Yates signed on to direct Order of the Phoenix, I re-fell in love with the Hary Potter movies.  David Yates directs the movies so well, and he really has made the final 4 Harry Potter movies what they should be-EPIC!<br /><br />Another reason to own this movie is to see how Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have grown up into wonderful actors.  Personally, I think in this movie, they really show off their acting chops and show everyone that they're serious actors, and damn good ones, too.  They weren't that bad in HP 1-4, but in this movie, they hit the nail on the head.  They've really gotten comfortable with their characters and portray them so well.<br /><br />Fans of Harry Potter and non-fans should buy this, even if just to own it.  This recent generation of kids growing up into teens, then young adults is going to forever be known as the Harry Potter Generation.  The books have sold over 400 million copies (and counting) and the Harry Potter franchise is the highest grossing film franchise in movie history and have given us 3 extremely talented young actors.  Be a part of the greatest film franchise in history!"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I bought this for my fiance and he's enjoyed every second of the extra footage (not to mention the amazing Iron Man)!
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	This was hillarious! I was laughing so hard I woke up my baby who was sleeping on my chest.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	I didn't want to see it at first because I thought it wouldn't do the original Iron Man justice, but it was pretty good. Nonstop action!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	The Insanity Workout is just like it says, insane!  My husband and I have done the P90X workout, and decided to give this a try, and it is MUCH more intense than P90X.  My husband is in very good shape, and this workout is kicking his butt!  Say nothing for me, I don't think I will master these workouts within 60 days, it may be more like 6 months before I can even come close to keeping up with exercises on this dvd set.  Which is great!  It will challenge me for quite a while, so you definately get your money's worth!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This show has everything, it's campy but not too much, it's sexy and has very sexy characters and some sex too.  I've always been fascinated with the idea of Vampires and Werewolves.. this story has it all.. and more!  There's romance, supernatural, telepathy, witches, and more!  The books are great too!
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"Wow, how I totally agree with the other people's reviews. This movie was so wrongly advertised. When i went to see this movie in the movie theater I was expecting another Signs, which I thought was an awesome movie, another great horror/thriller. Well the first third of the film seemed promising but then it all turned into crap. Sorry if i am not writing intellectual enough but this movie does not deserve it. The ""twists"" were crap, that is what this movie did wrong first and foremost. I wont ruin the movie for those who havent seen it but i told myself that i ""hope this doesnt happen"" and it does. The final twist was interesting though, i honestly didnt see that coming [...]"
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"That age-old method by which a viewer or reader dismisses an interpretative form of art--based upon the superiority of its alter-ego--has personally always mystified me, as comparing a book to a movie seems inherently illogical.  The internal monologue character's have with themselves can never be adequately transmitted onto the silver screen without extending the movie to a running time of several days.  Likewise, facial expressions and nuances of body language portrayed by actors can only be transferred to the page by the most gifted of authors.  In other words, saying that ""the book was better"" seems a bit off, rationally-speaking.<br /><br />Well, this time the book is not better.  J.K Rowling's fifth book in the popular ""Harry Potter"" series was a bloated, rambling affair which entertained only if you were able to ""buzz"" through the chaff.  Director David Yates cuts through the fluff, strengthens the plotline, and improves the focus of a story which desperately required such changes.  Fans need not worry--although there are some noticeable changes, the movie remains true to the book.<br /><br />The film opens with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his semi-relative Dudley again about to lock horns when the duo is attacked by Dementors, those demonic Azkaban guards capable of instilling everlasting ennui in the minds of their victims.  Harry uses the Patronus charm to dispel the fiends, thus saving his own and Dudley's souls.  Unfortunately, the usage of magic off the grounds of Hogwarts in the presence of Muggles is strictly forbidden for underage spellcasters, thus provoking Harry's immediate expulsion from school.  Luckily, he is permitted an appeal before the Ministry of Magic, where he possesses as ace-in-the-hole the most influential wizard alive:  Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon).  From there, the protagonist is thrust into a dazzling game of political brinksmanship, where the players are willing to evade facts to retain a feeling of security.  However, the fate of the world remains unclear, ignored by those seeking to play their games and hide from one, terrible truth:  Lord Voldemort has returned.<br /><br />Defense Against the Dark Arts instructors are changed as rapidly as ""Harry Potter"" movie directors, and we find the same in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), an associate of Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic, has accepted the position, and quickly reveals herself to be short on instruction and long on malice.  In the name of efficiency, she enacts as series of increasingly-stifling edicts, targets Harry for punishment whenever he professes that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is gathering his forces, and attempts to undermine Professor Dumbledore's authority.  The truly vile nature of this character does not come across as clearly in the movie as in the text, and that is probably a good thing--this creation from Rowling's imagination is a near-sociopath who inflicted many readers with a desire to reach through the pages to strangle her.  The lengths to which she and Fudge go to suppress the truth conjure up the ghosts of Neville Chamberlain and Joe McCarthy in the mind of the viewer.  That she believes she is a force of good in the struggle against the dark is a terrifyingly subtle commentary on the real nature of delusion.  As an aside, if you would enjoy seeing a situation in which not one, but two characters like Umbridge do not get their comeuppance, may I gingerly suggest watching ""Funny Games.""<br /><br />Of course, Harry is not without allies as he remains stalwart.  His twin pillars of fortitude, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), provide much-needed reservoirs of strength to our hero as he confronts Umbridge, Voldemort, and a deadly new horror:  first love.  Heroism itself is examined thoroughly in the film, and is shown to contain several sharp edges us mundane citizens may never understand.  He sees that his peers expect him to lead, to save others, to sacrifice his normal life, and to triumph against the forces of night.  Indeed, he is coming closer to an ultimate epiphany:  that his life is, figuratively and literally, not his own to live.  His existence is irrevocably tied to his duty, and coming to gripes with this fact is something with which Harry struggles constantly.  Unfortunately, his personal demons are sharing space with some real-world evil entities--one of which who may just be able to read Harry's thoughts.<br /><br />""The Order of the Phoenix"" is dark without being dreary.  Harry's relationship with his fugitive uncle Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), his bittersweet attempt at romance, and the antics of the Weasley twins help balance the tone of the film.  The set design is uniformly impressive, and the realism of the otherworldly creatures can easily suspend one's disbelief.  There were a few sections from the book that I would have preferred included in the film; nevertheless, one's enjoyment is preserved throughout the entirety of the movie, despite the disappearance of a certain screaming portrait.  The acting is quite good, with the exception of some of the actors portraying Aurors and Deatheaters.  In summary, all of our favorite friends have returned to populate a realm which exists only in Rowling's mind, yet Yates makes them seem real enough to the rest of us Muggles.  This is one of the better film translations thus far, and well-worth the time of any aficionado of mysteries from the magical world."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I'm probably a little late coming in on this. I did not see Polar Express when it came out in theaters. I offered to take my children, and they weren't interested for some reason. We first saw it when we watched it at home after our Thanksgiving meal. What a perfect way to kick off the Christmas season. I was planning to turn it on for the kids and then leave the room, but I was hooked right away and we were all mesmerized throughout the movie. It is beautiful, exciting and touching all at the same time. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I fell in love with this movie. It really is in a league of it's own for Christmas movies. The music is also wonderful. I have purchased the soundtrack and it will become a Christmas classic along with the movie. I NEVER cry at a movie, but if you don't get misty-eyed during 'When Christmas Comes to Town' or 'Believe' then you have to be made of stone. No one will regret having this in their collection to pull out every year and re-live the magic. I think we will probably watch it every Thanksgiving night to kick off the season from now on. Usually when I purchase a DVD, I think long and hard about how often I will really watch it and if it will be worth the cost. I didn't think twice about this one. I am very proud to own this DVD and know it will bring many, many years of joy.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a COMPLETE ripoff.<br /><br />This is the best they could do after 19 years between films?<br /><br />If you haven't seen the movie yet...don't waste your $.<br /><br />Wait for the original trilogy to come out on blu-ray.<br /><br />If anyone gave this move 4 or 5 stars, they need to be on medication!!
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"Ordered DVD thru Amazon, great service & price.  Film was basically centered on a nutty guy who kills dozens of people during various cat and mouse chases.  Almost every actor gets killed during the movie (except the one we'd actually want to see die).  Some good tense drama at times, however, at the end, it left me wondering why I spent two hours watching a film that left me unmoved and unsatisfied.  I loved ""Fargo"" and ""A Serious Man"" - two other films by the Coen Bros.  At least they had some DEPTH!"
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is an excellent movie. It may not be a product from Hollywood, but it can give Hollywood a run for it's money. The story content addresses one of the previlent problems attacking todays marraiges, pornography. A couple should watch it together, but if you have no choice but to watch it alone, please watch it.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This show is amazing! But, I think you should check out an episode or two at least if you haven't seen any of it before... Just to make sure you like it.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I work out daily and am in relatively good shape.  Insanity is the only thing that brought me back to the intensity of high school wrestling practice.  I had my metabolism up so high at the end of each session that I would take a cold shower afterwards and get out only to immediately start sweating again.  This work out can be for everyone if they modify it to themselves.  I know other people who use it and exercise at a lower level of intensity and helps them, but does not get the same results.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	The picture quality of Blu-ray is fantastic. The 5.1 track is also fantastic. This movie is also fantastic. I can't think of anything that is wrong with this release.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	I enjoyed the movie and the only thing I noticed was it seemed washed out in the dark scenes in the beginning of the move. Other then that issue I liked the fact the Amazon streams the movies in its entirety to my TiVo box. I noticed no pixilation or any other visual anomalies that I have experienced using Verizon on demand movie service and it was a dollar cheaper at Amazon for the HD version.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I echo the sentiments of most of the other reviewers.<br /><br />This film was INTENSE.<br /><br />I have felt like crap from the age 25 onward and now I understand why.<br /><br />I will never eat meat again.  I will eat more fruits and veggies.  I will buy local every chance I get.<br /><br />Wow.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"This is the most mind blowing movie I have ever seen. It has definetely changed the way I will ever eat, think and look at our ""goverment"", controled by all these food industries. This is a corrupted country and have been poisoning their own people, making them sick, obese and blinded by the veil of ""good"", ""safe"" food they sale."
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	I didn't realize Kristen Stewart acted this movie, It looked like she was sad, waiting for her vampire to arrive all the time.<br /><br />A nice start for the story every one knows about, but failed to deliver with inconsistencies of the main character and the lack of acting.
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	When is a believer going to make a reality film about relationships that are hurt by porn, abuse etc. that are biblically based? I spent 25 years doing good dare deeds church leaders told me to do to save my children and I from divorce, my spouse didn't use a computer, even if he had I don't think it alone would have been responsible for his behavior so much that he would have needed to show violence by beating it with a bat for an instant cure. When are church leaders going to start teaching us the truth on these issues and what it takes, if they would leave the false teaching and myths out that have not worked for years and get to the truth, families would not be in the messes they are in. These pastors that preach like angry spitting rapid dogs, with nothing but shame and fear attached along with false teachings on submission and the sparing of the rod etc. for its members. This movie is a farce, hurtful to hurting families. People wake up! Start reading your bibles and only being dependent on false teachers, you are being lazy...stop feeling like when you spend your money on something claimed christian produced you have to go along with everyone else saying Oh yes I bought my copy already, or my church is showing this film as a group, SPEAK UP...Self growth is forgotten because most so called christians are lazy and codependent on a leader, they seek nothing on their own...I don't want to be harsh, although we must really think about what this movie was saying...on serious issues. Stop making these people rich off nonbiblical teachings that hurt families...
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My wife has been looking for this Blu Ray DVD for sometime, but all of the outlets have not reduced their price.  Therefore, we surfed the internet at Amazon and found a seller who was selling it for a discount.  We immediately purchased the DVD and are thoroughly enjoying it in Blu Ray.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"A previous reviewer has said enough about the movie itself (it's a great movie) and the special features.  I want to talk about picture quality.  Anyone with a Blu-ray player and an HDTV, knows how good movies look in high definition.  I've owned a Blu-ray player (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J4VQ"">PlayStation 3 120 GB</a>) and and HDTV (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U3Y8QI"">Samsung LN46B630 46-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color</a>) for several years now and I have dozens of Blu-ray movies.  Cars is simply stunning in Blu-ray, hands down it is one of the best movies to watch on Blu-ray.  The picture quality is seriously jaw dropping."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is a genius. His material is hilarious and appeals to a wide range of audience. We have watched it over and over and shared it with all of our friends and family.Hope there is more Jeff Dunham in the future.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	"Fantasy films have always held an interest for me. This rendition of the ""Snow White"" story was really wonderful. The computer generated imagery enhanced the story and the performances by the actors were convincing. A worthwhile addition to my DVD collection and warrants a replay time and time again. I would certainly recommend this film for the imaginative more than a fairy tale viewer. Good fun."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	If you looking for a workout that will get you fit, if you stick with it than this is the one. You definately have to stay hydrated but trust doing this workout you gonna drink water unforced.<br />  Gonna tell the truth if you don't already workout starting cold turkey like me is gonna give you problems. Especially being 42 with a former knee injury. But once I adjusted I'm doing much better still getting a true hardcore workout but at my pace. When I finish the 60 days I'm gonna start it again since I should be a lil bit more advance and ready for what shocked me in the beginning.<br />  And for you fitness nuts that think no weights no gain. I have lost weight and built muscle in the 3 weeks I'm into the program already so it works if you have the drive.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I have not opened this movie yet because it is a christmas gift, (and it came in mail in excellent condtion) and I have not had any bad experiences with Amazon and the companies that ship me my purchases I've made, so I will recommend Amazon to everyone that is interested in saving a few dollars. Keep up the good work and thank you Amazon and the company that sent me my item.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"""The Departed"" (2006) is a thrilling, totally riviting crime-drama, directed by the award-winning Martin Scorsese, delivering what is undoubtedly his most enthralling film since the masterpiece ""Goodfellas"" (1990). ""The Departed"" was based on the Hong Kong film ""Infernal Affairs"" by Alan Mak and Felix Chong. William Monahan delivered the scorching screenplay, crackling with savage, brutal wit while producers of ""The Departed"" included Brad Pitt, Brad Grey and Graham King. With such a high calibre team behind the scenes, the impressive array of A list actors all deliver magnificent performances, complimenting the stark blend of unflinching violence, harrowing, psychological drama and exhilirating, rip-roaring action scenes.<br /><br />Young Billy Costigan (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a rookie, Boston-based cop. Billy grew up in a world surrounded by crime and violence. Billy's superiors, the diligient Queenan (martin Sheen) and ever-obnoxious, but straight, Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) are desperate to catch notorious local mafia godfather Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and see Billy as the only suitable member of the team, given his background, to go undercover and trap Costello. Reluctantly Billy agrees, seeing he has little choice, and cunningly wins Costellos trust.<br />The intriguing drama unravels further when, unbeknown to Billy, Queenan and Dignam, is that Costello had groomed sneaky and nauseating Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) to be his unscrupulous spy on the force. In a flash back sequence at the beginning of the film, it depicts that Costello had preyed upon Colin when he was just a young boy and brainwashed him to his evil, corrupt way of thinking.<br /><br />Heading the cast is another stunning performance from the versatile Leonardo Di Caprio as the mentally tortured undercover cop Billy Costigan. He conveys many dimensions to his character, giving it infinite depth. You get a more psychological insight into his character during the scenes where Billy pours his heart and anguish out to his understanding councellor, who he subsequently ends up having an on-off affair with (while she is dating Colin Sullivan).<br />Jack Nicholson is devilishly evil as Frank Costello, the highly feared king of the underworld. His mere presence in the fim enhances the seedy, cut-throat atmosphere. Costello is clearly insane and when he discovers there's a ""rat"" among his team, his paranoya escalated further and he begins losing his mind. This is played with stark realism by Jack Nicholson who is in his best role in some years.<br /><br />Matt Damon plays the snake Colin Sullivan, Costellos mole, and shines in all of his scenes. On occasions during the film, you question whether you should really feel some empathy towards his character having clearly been brainwashed and manipulated by Costello when he was at a very impressionable age. However, upon witnessing Colin's underhand tricks and how he evidently wouldn't think twice of killing anyone he even suspects as getting in his way or bringing him down, you suddenly lose that slight sense of empathy.<br />Even the luminous lead performances by Leonardo Di Caprio, Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon have an extremely hard job not being upstaged by the stunning, scene-stealing supporting performances from Ray Winstone, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin and Martin Sheen. The ultimate on-screen hard man, Ray Winstone, is terrifying as the cool, calm collected hitman Mr. French. Ray's understated performance is oscar worthy! He possesses a strong screen presence and the way he can shift from being composed to just suddenly gunning down somebody without even blinking, is ever-riviting to watch. Very edge of your seat stuff! Quite simply he steals any scene hes in and even Leonardo Di Caprio and Jack Nicholson seem slightly humble in his presence.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg is also thoroughly fantastic in his memroable supporting turn as the snide Dignam. Dignam is, thankfully, on the right side of the law (until the end that is - wont say anymore as dont wish to spoilt it for those that yet to view this film) but revels in winding up undercover mole Billy and constantly cross paths with him, Colin and other members of the force. Mark Wahlberg richly compiments the rapid flow of the razor sharp dialogue and seemingly breezes into his character almost effortlessly. Martin Sheen is also of good value too, in his small but effective role of the more sympathetic detective Queenan while Alec Baldwin also delivers a scene-stealing performance as a passionate though often aggressive cop.<br />With a gallery of top notch actors, an intriguing screenplay, first-class direction, rollercoaster dialogue, ""The Departed"" is an exceptional film, and nothing short of a masterpiece.<br /><br />The extras on this double disc set are all fascinating. they include additional scenes with introductions by Martin Scorsese and documentaries such as Stranger than fiction:The story of the Boston Mob, The real Life Gangster behind Jack Nicholsons character and theatrical trailer. Excellent value for money!<br />Ian Phillips<br />September 2009"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My son has watched this movie over and over since he got it at Christmas. Even for the hundred millionth time, it is still a nice movie for adults to watch. It also has a great message. A must add to your DVD collection!
B00447G29S	1.0	b	THE MOVIE WAS GREAT FOR THE FIRST 33 MINUTES THEN TURNS RED THE PICTURE THEN FREEZES.  AMAZON IS<br />SELLING DEFECTIVE MOVIES.  I PURCHASED BRAND NEW FOR 27.99.  THEY SHOULD SEND ME DISNEY UP COMBO<br />PACK AS A REPLACEMENT FOR 24.99.  CUSTOMER SERVICE IS POOR!
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	The promotion of this film was better than the film. Once you get past the first half dozen or so random killings and the deadpan acting, the rest is even worse. The idea that the film is sending some sort of insightful message about random violence is without merit. After about the first 10 minutes anyone with an IQ above about 30 should figure out random violence is bad and by the way have you noticed random violence is bad? Save your time, save your money and just watch the news.<br /><br />Random violence is bad. Wow what an insight!<br /><br />This film is evidence of how far the standards for films has fallen in the industry.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I missed the series on TV but was delighted to see the actors winning kudos for their protrayals.  It inspired me to buy the series and I was very glad I did.  It was a bit of history that I didn't remember from my high school days and I was very pleased to see it.  The costumes and acting were first rate.  I think both Paul Giamoti and Laura Linney are underrated as actors and I am glad to see them finally getting their due.  Great series.  Thx, Nancy
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Insanity arrived exactly as described and has been as insane as advertised.  The workouts are great because you can do them at home and look like an idiot in the privacy of your own space.  The workouts suck because they are as difficult as everyone says they are.  Tons of movement, tons of sweat and yes, intense.  The good news is that most are completed inside of an hour and after 60 days you can always go back and cycle in a favorite disc every now and then.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Caleb (Kirk Cameron) is an experienced and highly successful fire-fighter, who save people on an almost daily basis, proud of what he does for a living, and apart from the fire-fighting his main focus is to save money for his dream boat.  He spends very little time with his wife Catherine (Erin Bethea), and when they are together, they quickly get into a quarrel and they both realise that they are heading for divorce.<br /><br />Caleb visits his parents to tell them, that he is finally giving up on his marriage.  They are not pleased with this news and his father is asking him for one last favour, before signing the divorce papers that Catherine has already served him.  Caleb doesn't give it many chances, but out of respect for his father he agrees to follow a plan for 40 days, each day having to do a small task for his partner, like not saying anything negative for a day, doing some chore for his partner etc.  Some tasks are very easy, some quite difficult, and the fun part is to see Catherine ignoring the coffee he made for her, and Caleb trying to cut corners on the tasks, like buying the cheapest possible bouquet of flowers.  The religious element is there, but it is not dominating the film, so non-religious people can definitely enjoy it too.  The message is very clear; fight for your marriage, it will be worth it.<br /><br />If your relationship is in trouble, buy it to learn how Caleb and Catherine got past their trouble, and if single; buy it for the entertainment and the learning process.<br /><br />I watched it with my wife, we both found it very worthwhile, only a bit one-sided as Caleb is the one doing all the work in saving their marriage, without any movement or encouragement from Catherine's side.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham and Walter Rock!! I've got a couple of relatives just like Walter. Good product, no skips. I would recommend this seller to anyone.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	This Harry Potter with a different Soundtrack and pretty much different everything except cast was a real let down to me. Melodrama was the key to this movie. I found myself bored and lost about the story. I paid to watch it on pay per view. I am glad I did not pay to see it at the movies.<br />This movie seemed to be about the cast taking a drama course at Hogwarts.<br />Hate it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	You can't but admire Robert Rodriguez for achieving his vision of bringing Frankie Miller's graphic novel Sin City, to the big screen.  The result of his dedication and vision, is a stylistic, visually striking, technically impressive, near perfect homage, to Miller's world of crime, violence, romance, revenge, women, and vice.  Miller had no plans for a Sin City film, but when Rodriguez demonstrated to him what the film could be, Miller got onboard the project as a co-director.  Using the graphic novels as the source, Rodriguez clearly envisioned technically how the film could be made, and transformed that concept into a reality that even exceeded the expectations of Frankie Miller, authentically capturing the look, style and atmosphere of Sin City.<br /><br />Another major contributor to the film's success is its amazing cast.  From top to bottom, Rodriguez enlisted a parade of top flight talent that is quite unique.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Torro, Jaime King, Carla Gugino, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, and Elijah Wood, head what is one of the more remarkable casts in a film of this decade, one that also includes Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Josh Harnett and Marlee Shelton in minor roles.<br /><br />Presented predominantly in black and white, the original version of Sin City cleverly blends several stories together in a fashion that holds together pretty cohesively, although the tonality of The Big Fat Kill incorporates a  bit more humor than the rest.  The performances are all strong, particularly considering the challenges of acting against a sterile green screen.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke, both rise to the top with gritty, powerful, and emotional performances.<br /><br />There are a ton of extras in this edition, including several commentaries, and numerous featurettes covering various facets of the production.  Lots of cool secrets are revealed in 'Fifteen Minute Film School with Robert Rodriguez'.  Shooting against a green screen, enabled scenic elements to be inserted in post production.  The extent to which this cool technique was employed, can be seen in 'The All Green Screen Version'.  There is also a short documentary about how Frankie Miller was convinced to greenlight and join the production.<br /><br />The film has been recut, with some additional footage added, into the four separate stories, The Customer is Always Right, That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye, and The Big Fat Kill.  They appear on Disc 2, and can be viewed in any order.  Also included is a copy of The Hard Goodbye graphic novel.  The recut, extended version (DVD or Blu Ray), costs more, but if you enjoy Sin City, this is certainly the one to get.<br /><br />Amazon should revise their policy of regarding different versions of the same movie as being equivalent.  This two disc recut version, not the same as the regular edition single disc release.  This situation widespread, and leads to confusion for those seeking specific information about what special features and extras may be included in any particular edition.  This policy not realistic, and does not serve the best interest of consumers.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I LOVE this movie!  I could watch it 10 times in one day and not even get tired of it!  It was heartwarming and my favorite Christmas movie.  I think it is great for all ages.  If you are thinking about buying this stop thinking and just buy it!  I love this movie (I think I've said that enough) I watched it a year ago on the T.V. and when Christmas came around and I couldn't stop watching it!  Heartwarming movie about believing in Santa Claus and also about being in the North Pole!
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"Since the first spotlighted reviewer wrote exactly what I had to say, I have to re-think ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" What is there new to say?<br /><br />I adore Harrison Ford. Has he won that special Oscar yet? He should (but not for this role). Let's get right on to Karen Allen. ""Marian, you're going to drive off the cliff."" ""Trust me, Indie. I know what I'm doing,"" and she does. She drives right onto a tree over the river and the car is gently delivered into the water. Wow! How is this possible? Because she is older and better? Because this is an Indiana Jones movie and the characters can do darn well anything they set their minds to doing. Then they skee-daddle right over a huge waterfall in that car. No problem. No broken bones. No concussions. Everyone lands a foot from their sitting place in the car and hops right back in. Then they do it again two more times over two more waterfalls.<br /><br />But my favorite action scene is when Indie and is-his-name-Mutt-or-Mudd? are riding the motorcycle through campus, trying to escape mad Russians representative of the Three Stooges minus one. Indie is pulled off the bike right through that little car window. After he wrestles around with the Stooge a bit, he slips right out that window onto the motorcycle again! Holy Moly! At his age he's that agile?<br /><br />One other thing that seriously bothered me was Indie opening the cocoons and allowing the folks inside to puff--go up in dust! No posterity! You'd think an archaeologist would know better.<br /><br />I do have a favorite scene: At the end when he and Marian kiss, it's such an old geezer kiss. Come on, Lucas and Spielberg, even as geezers we can still pucker out a wet one.<br /><br />I dozed off during this movie. I dozed during an Indiana Jones movie! What's wrong with the world? And that kid? Please don't make him the next ""Indie"" He doesn't have IT!"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is incredibly talented and he will have you in stitches.  I almost fell off my couch laughing when he was working with Peanut.  Do yourself a favor and watch this immediately!
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	Little slow at the start (opening monologue, no characters), but great after that.  Laughed so hard the first time I watched it, thought I was going to choke on my drink.  Easily one of my top 5 all-time for funniest stand-up comedy show.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Watched it online, HD and very clear, no pauses. Excellent audio. I was planning to buy the DVD but after watching it online, I do not think I need to do that anymore.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	It is getting to the point where there are more good animated movies being made then live action movies. This is another great animated film. The DVD is an excellent transfer and a must have for family viewing.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	AN EXCELLENT PRESENTATION OF THE LIVES OF BOTH JOHN AND ABIGAIL ADAMS...A VERY SWEET STORY OF AN AWESOME FRIENDSHIP, PARTNERSHIP, AND MARRIAGE.  VERY GOOD INSIGHTS INTO THE LIVES OF THE MEN WHO GAVE THEIR ALL TO FORM OUR NATION. PAUL GIAMATTI AND LAURA LINNEY ARE SO REAL AND CONVINCING.  I HAVE GIVEN SEVERAL COPIES AS GIFTS TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY.  IT IS A CLASSIC.  FIVE STARS AND 2 THUMBS UP.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	It was great! I loved this movie, and can't wait to see it again! And it came in a speedy manner!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	HBO did a wonderful job producing this miniseries. It is well worth the investment of your time and money. If you have the time and motivation I would also recommend the book. It is very well written, provides a better texture of the moment, and is very interesting.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	This movie is terrible. I hate it with a great passion. There is no film that will ever rival the awfulness of this horrendous and twisted piece of crap. Please don't watch this abhorrent load of goat crap, read the book (which is great) but whatever you do, don't watch this filthy thing that calls itself a movie. The Polar Express is a product of the devil.

B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I am a big Harry Potter fan, books & movies & I think this is the best Harry Potter Movie yet!!!
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	I want to start by saying `No Country For Old Men' has one of the most menacing bad guys of the many films that I have seen. He is mostly eerily silent and when he does talk it is quietly and controlled, he is ruthless, unrelenting and with an almost psychopathic element to his nature. This alone would make for compelling viewing before you add in the storyline of the film. From the word go this film has a dark and brooding atmosphere to it and the tension is palpable and only builds as it progresses. Following one man who stumbles across a case full of money, another trying to track him down and the sheriff who is trying to protect and serve, provides the hunter and hunted plot that keeps you fully engrossed. This has amazing performances from all involved, Brolin, Lee-Jones and Bardem are all riveting to watch and this is probably Tommy Lee-Jones' best performance to date. You get the added bonus of Woody Harrelson in a minor role and yet he still manages to deliver another top job as he always does. At just under two hours this film isn't excessively long and I found myself intrigued and on edge the whole time. The ending kind of fizzled out after ratcheting up the tension (hence the four stars) but overall this makes for satisfying viewing. This is one of those films on Amazon that seems to be either loved or hated and it has to be said that it's not your Hollywood, all action blockbuster, but it's all the better for that. If you like well acted, slow burning, beautifully directed and tension filled films, then this is the place to go. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I thought the portrayal of the Queen was one of the best. She took it to a different level. I just really enjoyed it.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I bought this for my husband in January 2012, he followed the program to the tie ands has lost 20 pounds and has really improved his overall physical appearance.  He wasn't over weight,  mainly just needed to lose about 20-25 pounds and just build some lean muscle.  He acheived both with this program,  it isn't  for the unmotivated though, the workouts are fast paced and require dedication and self drive.  If you are self driven to workout hard and want to see fast resulta this program is for you!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"This is a ""must see"" film filled with colorful characters and a great cast. 'Javier Bardem' who I am not familiar with proved to be a disturbing and menacing unforgettable force. This film doesn't waste anytime getting to it and it's 2 hour length was time well spent. The violence is sometimes graphic, but there are many violent acts that are implied. One of, if not the best picture I've seen all year. The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	There is a lot of action in this movie.  Deep emotion is shown.  What happens in this movie could be the scenario of a couple in today's world.  I couldn't watch this movie without getting tears in my eyes.  It is gut wrenching.  I looked over at my husband...his eyes were glistening,too.  This movie appeals to young and older couples and touches your heart.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	Not bad at all. Not the best either. If you liked the others, you'll probably get this anyway!
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	There are things about this movie that were great. But then there were things about this movie that were just not so good or at least could have been much better<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />The acting: Hemsworth did exceptionally well. He was really the best thing about this entire movie. Theron did a very good job as the queen as well and the majority of the other actors (especially the dwarves) had a very good performance as well.<br /><br />CG: The special effects were great. From the phantom armies to the environment, this movie did a great job of portraying a mystical land full of danger and beauty<br /><br />Environment: Costumes and landscape were great. From the merky dungeons, to the ugly castles, to the dreary towns, dark forest, sanctuary, animals, everything about the environment was just great. They probably could have done a little more with the black forest but still, what they did do was great.<br /><br />The ok but could have been much better<br /><br />Battle Scenes: So the previews led me to believe this movie would be a braveheart style movie with a heroine and in the land of mysticism. It wasn't. There were a few battle scenes that were good but most were rather boring and no where close to epic. The very last confrontation was the best and did get you into it but every battle scene leading up to it was lack luster.<br /><br />Story: Now the story is the story that we have all heard before. So I'm not complaining about THAT story, but really they didn't do enough with it to warrant me shelling 20 bucks for me and my wife to go sit in a theater to watch it. If you are someone that just ABSOLUTELY loves the story of Snow White then maybe you probably won't care but all the glitter and glam they added to the story, still fell short of being worth it and taking it from the old old story I've grown up hearing.<br /><br />The bad<br /><br />The acting: Kristen Stewart. I'm sorry but this was either not her movie or not her performance. I liked her in adventureland. But her acting skills either weren't strong enough for this role or she just wasn't the right match. She just fell short unfortunately.<br /><br />All in all it's a decent movie worth watching. Is it worth shelling out 10 bucks a person to watch? No probably not. Is it worth a buck at redbox? Definitely. The beautiful environment and classic story are enough to bring you in but the lack of originality, boring battle scenes, and uneven acting is enough to give you pause.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	SIN CITY WAS A VERY ENTERTAINING FILM. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS FILMED. THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY STRONG AND ARE EXCELLENT IN THEIR PARTS. IT NEEDS TO BE REMEMBERED, HOWEVER, THAT THE MOVIE IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	Snow White and the Huntsman was a nearly perfect movie.  Charlize Theron was amazing as usual.  As was Chris Hemsworth.  His fake Irish accent didn't go over too well, but his performance was excellent.  Another highlight for me was the seven dwarves.  I loved the new take on their life style, and the actors were very well chosen.  The only drawback for me was Kristen Stewart's acting.  I will say this in her favor, however, she did seem to put forth more effort in trying not to be so wooden.  But it is painfully obvious that she is trying.  I'm not sure if it's lack of confidence or what, but she always seems very unsure of herself.  I do hope that she is able in time to grow into a more mature and confident actress.  But for now, I would love to have seen the movie with a more adept actress playing the part of Snow White.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This comedy routine was also funny my husband and I both enjoy jeff dunham,s work.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Sin City is an excellent movie with a great cast and a great story, actually 3 stories combined that makes one of the best movies of the year so far. Props to everyone.
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	What is the problem with the discs in this set.<br />I see a couple mentions on the internet that disc 1 isn't playing?<br />Is this why Amazon pulled it?
B0006989TE	5.0	b	Some kid told me this movie was bad.  I saw it anyway and it was great.  It is very suspenceful.  The twist is great. The ending is a little bit inconclusive, but it is still tastefull and not unsettling.  I hope M. Night keeps making good movies like this one.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"This review is for everyone, but especially for women who may be interested in this workout but hesitant about whether they can manage it. YOU CAN!!  I am 5'2, 105lbs, and 26 years old.  I had a baby 9 months ago and have lost most of the weight but was looking for something to tone my body.  This is it!  I am only a week into the program, but I can already see results!  I feel better and look better.  Yes, the workout is challenging, but if you are in decent shape, you can manage it.  If you are still hesitant, I would suggest trying Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred first. It is similar to this workout in that it incorporates interval training and some of the same type of moves.  It's only $10, and it'll give you a good idea of whether you're ready for the Insanity workout. I did the 30 Day Shred after having my son, and while it was great for a while, I was ready for something more intense.  Don't be intimidated by Insanity, though--you can do it! I will agree with all other reviewers that it is not for anyone with knee or wrist injuries.  Also, to get the most out of this workout, you'll want to follow the eating plan.  It's not so much a ""diet"" as it is a guideline. I can honestly say that I don't feel hungry while following the eating plan. You eat 5 small meals every 3 hours, and the amount of calories you eat at each meal is calculated by your height, weight, age, and whether you want to lose weight or simply maintain your weight.  There are so many options in the eating guide, and you can easily come up with your own alternatives with the guidelines they provide.  I just had half a peanut butter sandwich and a small glass of low-fat chocolate milk (which serves as a ""recovery formula""--no kidding).  What other workout plan allows you to do that?  I highly recommend this workout program!"
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	It's a decent show, on it's own I would say it's great. But being as I am a huge fan of the book series, the deviations from the book can irk me at time.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	The storyline of this movie is something that every married couple can relate to. It has improved my marriage and was very much worth the money.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Went to the cinema to see this film and couldn't wait for the DVD to be released.  I was not disappointed and found it even better the second time around.  It reminded me a little of the TV series 'Merlin', very dark and mysterious.  The special effects are amazing and Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron are superbly cast.  This one is definitely NOT for the children - quite scary in places!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I never watch anything twice, not only did I watch twice but three times.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	An excellent movie, I am glad that Martin Scorsese finally got a well-deserved Oscar :-)
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	Was very happy with my purchase...Good movie...And the whole shopping experience was quick and easy...
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino produced another masterpiece. Most of the people are comparing this movie with Kill Bill, they are totally different concepts. Sin City is the recreation of Frank Miller's pulpy comic books and digital techniques has been used for entire background of the movie. Black and white scenes and absurd colors make this movie very unique. Players (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen) performance are great. There are three stories (The Hard Goodbye, The Big Fat Kill, and That Yellow Bastard) in the movie, each is very interesting. In the first story, Marv wants to find killer of his girlfriend just got from the bar. Secondly, Dwight protect his girlfriend from ex-cop and try to prevent chaos caused by him, and finally Willis try to save young lady who saved long time ago and got into jail due to her.<br /><br />This is another digital masterpiece and very creative story. It is possible to see Tarantino effect on it. As a Tarantino fan, I like the ""Sin City"" and suggest to everybody."
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	"Criticism of this movie is a mystery to me. My kids has so far place this movie on there top ten mini lists. I have yet to see a bad Pixar film (even ""A Bug's Life"" is still entertaining, for kids anyway) and the only reason that I can think of is how difficult it is to follow a film of such real quality like ""The Incredibles"". I'm honestly struggling to think of a fault with this film which is bright, colourful, noisy and funny - perfect for the younger members of your family. But there is also more than enough for the adults to enjoy as well, not even mentioning the exceptionally high standard of animation and voice casting. ""Cars"" introduces us to a world where there are no people and cars are alive (and not just cars - helicopters, SUVs, tractors, you name it).<br /><br />Once you've adjusted yourself to the quirky world of ""Cars"" then you're in for a real treat. The first thing you notice is the epic scale of the thing and how wonderful it all looks. Whether it's crowded stands at a stadium or the timeless beauty of the Grand Canyon, Pixar provides further proof (if any were needed) that they are the new masters of animation. Everything is bright and full of colour and life and after a while, you even forget that you're watching a cartoon altogether! I thought that a new standard had been reached in animation with ""The Incredibles"" but this looks even better than that. The voice casting is also superb, as always, with Newman and Wilson leading a cast of real quality. Even finding Jeremy Clarkson and Michael Schumacher in cameos was a real blast, although American audiences probably would have enjoyed (and recognised) Jay Leno or Mario Andretti a bit more. Some characters maybe weren't as defined as others - low-rider Ramone (Cheech Marin) and 50's cruiser Flo (Jenifer Lewis) weren't as defined as others and didn't feel part of the story - but with so much on screen (especially during the race sequences), it's easy to lose some aspects of the film in the noise and spectacle.<br /><br />The dialogue is littered with one-liners while references and in-jokes abound (Lightning's tyre, for example, are called ""Lightyears""). The pace of the movie also fitted the story - fast and loud at the start, slow and quiet in Radiator Springs - and the whole thing is filled with the typically enthusiastic imagination that Pixar infuse their pictures with. However, for all of the technical brilliance of ""Cars"", I still prefer ""The Incredibles"" - it's more fun and doesn't sag in the middle as much as this did. But ""Cars"" is still a wonderful film and one that appears to have been underrated already by certain other critics. Don't listen to them - this is a family film of genuine class and quality and you'll be missing out if you don't watch it. Vroom-vroom!"
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	One of the best animated movies to watch on your blu-ray system.  The detail on the screen are incredible.  The sound is thrilling.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	If you like to laugh then this video is for you. In this video you will meet 2 new characters Achmed and Melvin. Achmed is a dead terrorist and he is so funny to watch especially his eyes. Melvin is a Super Hero. He is so cute and his special feature will crack you up. Then of course my most favorite charater is Peanut. After watching this vidoe I now have to get my Peanut fix almost every night it's that funny. Please buy this you will not be disappointed.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"The film itself was much much better watching it again after watching Deathly Hallows Part 2. The first time I watched this as a rental before Pt 2 was out I was not impressed, thought it was the least dynamic and interesting of the Potter films - kind of dull and flat, lack of plot elements as well as ""new scenery"" of the world created by Rowling. This is probably why it's so inexpensive even on blue ray. I must say I enjoy it more now on re-run.<br /><br />Bought this and Part 2 because of the upcoming ""blackout"" on Potter DVDs/broadcasts/streaming availability that is going to happen in 2012 and will last until Warner Bros. releases the new box set some time in 2012 or possibly even 2013. I do like to have Harry Potter ""marathon weekends"" on my own time, especially holed up during snowstorms and since I have all the other movies I didn't want to wait for the box set to watch the whole saga when I want to. And of course if the box set does not provide extended versions of these films with ample extra footage in all of them in my opinion it will be pointless to have since I'm not a collector but watch for ""entertainment value""."
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	This was a terrific and captivating movie yet I cannot ignore the terrible ending. It's the worst ending I had ever seen not neccesarily due to the content but because it took this totally engrossing movie and, basically, just pulled the plug on it!<br /><br />Damn you Coen brothers!
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"I walked out of the theater loving this and heard a great comment while stopping off in the bathroom before heading to my car.....""This movie was supposed to have something to do with the movie ""Alien"" right?"" Best thing I heard all week, and a great marker for how people reacted to the movie. If you love the Alien series then you completely got this installment. The visuals were stunning, Noomi Rapace was great, particularly in one cringe worthy scene, the story behind the race that you received a glimpse of in the first Alien movie was incredible and leaves room for additional movies. I can see where some people will hate this and ultimately pass out a one star rating but if you really love the series, you will love Prometheus!"
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	"A little known secret about Pixar, is their huge support for their local community.  Last night I attended a fund raiser premier of CARS at Pixar's studio's in Emeryville CA.  The event raised over $80,000 for our local school district!<br /><br />So here are my thoughts on the movie.<br /><br />Firstly, this is a fast paced and LOUD movie.  Those with sensitive ears should think about taking cotton buds to the theater.<br /><br />Ok, I read some of the comments so far based on the teaser's and have to say that the animated cars are done wonderfully.  Each car really has it's own personality and although they do look a little cartoonish, Pixar has again shown that they can animate anything and bring it to life and then some.<br /><br />The big race scenes are really only at the very beginning and at the very end, the majority of the movie is set in a small town ""Radiator Springs"" somewhere in the midwest just off Route 66.<br /><br />I won't give too much away as far as the story goes, you'll need to go see it yourself for that.<br /><br />The movie is packed full of very funny jokes and scenes, like the Tractor Tipping scene, and the SUV off-road bootcamp!<br /><br />Visually, this movie is stunning.  I can't imagine the amount of research that went into producing this one.  Anyone who has driven I-40 near Amarillo TX will recognise the mountain ranges shaped like old Cadillac's burried nose down in the sand.  They really capture the road trip experience.  And the scenery is breath-taking.<br /><br />Not being a big fan of ""Larry The Cable Guy"" I have to say that his performance as Mater the tow truck, was brilliant.  As one of the main characters, he was very funny and endearing.<br /><br />Technically, Pixar really pushed the envelope again.  We're used to Pixar movies breaking ground in each movie, the underwater rendering in Finding Nemo, the fur rendering in Monsters Inc., etc.. In cars, it's all about the rendering of dust particles which looks super realistic and is not an easy thing to achieve.<br /><br />Overall, this movie will have great appeal to a lot of people, although I personally think that The Incredibles is still my favorite.  This one might not win the Best Animated Feature award but I'm sure it will get awards for the technical aspects of the film.<br /><br />Finally, I just want to thank Pixar once again for their amazing and continued support to the local community, whether it be fund raising events like last nights, or the masses of computers they donate to the schools, or the number of their employee's that regularly volunteer their freetime to work with the kids in mentoring programs.  I couldn't wish for a better neighbor."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is awesome! He is so funny! Especially his character, Peanut! Jeff makes his characters come to life. He is a gifted entertainer! Laughter is the best medicine! I highly recommend this DVD. I can't wait until he makes another one.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"Excellent Find. Contains Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Bahasa and Malay. Who knew? Get the ""coby all regions dvd player"" and enjoy."
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Movie is worth owning.  Interesting story twist but even better cinema.  Beautiful costumes and sets.  I movie that doesn't seem like it wants to be in the trilogy race.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	this is a must see movie:  I am recommending this for everyone as an absolute necessity for wise decision makers.  Thank you for a great product.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I bought this for myself a short time ago and I love it. An excellent piece for my movie collection.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"Ok so I have to first say that I work out 4-5 times a week with pretty intense cardio. I've been working out like that for a few years now and if it hadn't been for my previous workout routine I would not have been able to do this series with as much ""ease"" as I did.<br />The biggest thing about this work out series is that he stresses the importance of stretching. Stretching is probably the most important part of keeping up with him. For all the days I was sore I never felt tight. I was always able to stretch and touch my toes or what ever. He's truly put in the work to make sure that the stretches matched the workout. For all those saying the stretches were not great than I would have to say I 100% disagree and have felt for years that the fitness industry does not encourage stretching the way they should. I teach fitness classes and can't stand why people walk out on the cool downs.<br /><br />So here's my pros and cons:<br />Pros:<br />Stretching (has to be my favorite thing about these DVDS)<br />Warmups are good and through<br />Works different sections each day<br />Each workout routine is just enough to push me beyond what I would have done on my own<br /><br />Cons:<br />This is so NOT a series for people with bad joints.<br />People with knee problems should look for something with less jumping and squats<br />I would not recommend for a beginner to start off with this series unless they are willing to do a little here and a little there and work up to a full workout<br /><br />Hope this helps! I have fully enjoyed every workout on this series, though I may not have loved every second of it while I was doing it :P As with any workout it is up to you to know what your body can handle. He does remind you about every minute or so never to loos your form or you'll hurt yourself. He's highly motivating.<br />For me I saw real results in just a couple of weeks but felt the results immediately!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	We have owned Cars dvd since it came out on video. We love it and highly recommend it to any family, especially those with toddler boys. Our 2 year old can get quite destructive to other toys and stuff around the house, and we can put Cars on and he calms right now. He loves this movie.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This move is a must see for everyone.  It has opened my eyes about the food industry in America.  Since seeing this movie I have only been buying organic food.  I am aware of what I am eating whereas before it was never a second thought.  I particularly am aware of meat products and how the animals are raised.  I will watch this movie again and am sharing it will all my friends and family.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This movie had some surprises along the way. It kept you waiting on the edge of your seat, knowing that something was happening to Harry and the truth would become more clear on many things.  It left you with wanting more and anxiously waiting for the next movie.  Although the young actors are doing a superb job, are they going to be young enough looking to pass for the age they need to appear to be by the time the next movie comes out?
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This was the best movie we had seen all year.  The best Marvel movie so far.  Hulk comes in second.  Most people dont know there is a secret scene after the credits roll with a huge star that is not in the main movie. So watch it after the credits.  I urge you to watch this before you watch the Hulk.  They play on each other.  I wonder whats coming next.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie rocks! My son loves it! He can watch it over and over again and never tired. And I know how to occupy  him for the almost 2 hours. Pixar is the greatest studio!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I was completely blown away by this Movie, it made me lauph and cry.<br />Paul Giamatti was fantastic, Laura Linney was superb. Both of them deserve to  win an Emmy or an Oscar for their performances.<br />It gave me a new perspective on how our country started and what our fore  fathers had to indure to bring us independence.<br />5 stars . Thanks HBO
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"I know that this movie has a lot of bad reviews because many people did not like the ending.  But I did.  Though I kind of figured out some of it the first time a creature makes its appearence, I had no problem with it.<br /><br />The acting is first-rate!  The movie seems to flow very well.  It never seemed to get boring.  There is some nice comic relief such as when a group of youths play ""chicken"" against the creatures by going into the woods and seeing how long they can try to attract the creatures before chickening out."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I buy about 3-7 products from amazon a week (mostly movies, books, and videogames)and I very rarely write reviews. So when I do take the time to write a review that purchase had to have been blockbuster. And that is what this movie is, A BLOCKBUSTER!!! This movie is instantly one of my top 10 and the best movie of the year. I heard people talk about it when it was in the theater but im not a theater person, I usually wait for movies to be released for home viewing (I prefer my 6.1 surround sound and 1080p monitor). I dont want to say anything to spoil any part of this movie because it was FLAWLESS from beginning to end. In closing get this movie, AMAZING PLOT, ACTING, SCRIPT, EVEN THE SCORE WAS GREAT!!!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	As a firefighter's wife, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  My husband did as well.  We have been married for 14 years and agree that we wish we could have seen this together many years ago as we were struggling through many of the same obstacles.  Not just for those in public safety though.  A fine movie for all, no matter what stage of life they are currently in.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	He just tells it like it is. Scientists have invested their lives, reputations, and pride in the THEORY of Evolution and won't let go. It's conform or be cast out.
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	This seller tried to sell me a bootleg copy of the DVD. The third disk did not/would not play and it was not in original factory sealed package as they said it was. I got a refund on this fake sell.
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	"Out of the 5 movies, this is my least favorite.  SO much stuff was cut ridiculously short or completely cut out.  (I think the other posts here describe numerous problems with this film so I don't think I need to go into any more detail). One of the posts said that this was a ""Clif Notes"" version of the book, my husband said the exact same thing after watching it and I agree)  So much was cut out of this story for the sake of special effects and time that I walked away from this film completely unsatisfied. I would have gladly sat for three hours to watch this film if it meant that all of the meaningful aspects of the book were included in the film.  If I can sit and watch ""Lord of the Rings"" and just about any Stephen King movie that comes out, I can do it with this series. It makes me wonder if the last two books will receive the same treatment as they are just as long. It was as if the director and the script writer just skimmed through the books and had no understanding of the entire story at all.  The saga aspect of this wonderful collection of books is completely lost in this latest film installment. On the bright side,the cast was superb.  The children's (wait...did I say children?) acting abilities are improving movie by movie and it is wonderful to see them growing up before our eyes.  The supporting cast is grand too.  I bought the DVD because I have the other four but I hope they change directors and they do a lot better on the last two movies or I might seriously have to rethink shelling out money to complete the set."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"I have been long time believer in organic and non process food. I did not want to support animal cruelty and we spend more money on<br />high quality food. People that watch this movie and still feel no need their eating habits are worrying me.<br />I also like Paul Check's ""you are what you eat"" audio tape that goes even more in depth what is going on in our food ""industry""<br />I am very happy somebody is looking in to the wrong that we feed our kids."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"The DVD was received as advised and in excellent condition.<br /><br />It is an interesting theme in Vampire folklore that should be watched by all whom enjoy vampire folklore; especially since you find very few people whom are ""Cajun"" in the town of Bon Temps, Louisiana."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	My grandson is obsessed with trains, so when I saw this movie advertised, I thought it would be a good one to watch with the entire family.  It made a perfect Christmas Eve, enjoying the story with the whole family.  Truly a must movie to watch with little ones (my grandchildren are 4 and 5).
B00447G29S	4.0	b	Better than average movie with adventure and the usual theme of believe-in-the-magic-of-Christmas. The adventure does have scary moments.<br /><br />This DVD was playing sort of in the background at last year's big holiday multi-day family gathering, with a dozen or so children under 8 years visiting cousins. The movie did not get my undivided attention, therefore, although it did get played multiple times. It did keep kids (and me too) from getting restless during some down times. In future years, I think I will play it again during such visits.<br /><br />One nice surprise was the way the movie pushed beyond stereotypes in a reasonably subtle way.<br /><br />If I remember correctly (the memory is vague now), one of the themes for the child characters was recognizing one's strengths and learning to use them, and appreciating that other individuals have different types of gifts.<br /><br />One of the main characters had the gift of leadership aptitude. As a child, I never gave leadership much thought -- how it works, etc. I'm glad the movie brought it forth, as something of importance. I didn't notice till years later, on the job, the important difference between a boss (or military officer) having the formal title and power to command people, versus a person who can lead -- who can inspire, motivate, and influence others even if he/she lacks a formal title. I don't know whether children viewing this movie will actually notice the subtle message that leadership is an important thing, since there is so much else going on in the movie that is more entertaining. But then again, young kids often watch the same DVD/video many times.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" works very well in spite of a rushed script, and a gripping climax pushes it into very nice maintenance of the series' extraordinarily high standards of quality.  First-time series director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg present largely top-notch work.<br /><br />The movie's titular 'Order of the Phoenix' is an honor guard of highly decorated Hogwarts teachers and associates who have sworn to protect Harry from the growing threat of a strengthening Lord Voldemort.  In a choppy movie from a narrative point of view, the Order of the Phoenix itself is somewhat a victim of fast cuts and general shortcomings.  It does provide a window into Grimmauld Place, the expressively dark family manse of Harry's godfather Sirius Black.  Gary Oldman again delivers a nuanced performance in what is a very important film for his character.<br /><br /> Simultaneously one of this movie's strengths and weaknesses, The Ministry of Magic ensures Harry will have enemies inside Hogwarts as well as outside of it.  Due to creative shortcuts, the Ministry is often glossed over in the film.  Ironically, in the book Ms. Rowling spends too much time expounding on it.  A balance could have and should have been achieved.  In the person of Dolores Umbridge, though, falsely sweet insincerity has a monstrous voice.  The name itself can mean 'painful offense.' Esteemed actress Imelda Staunton plays the character very well.<br /><br />Returning actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint again deliver natural camaraderie and acting skills, and are joined by returning colleagues Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Severus Snape.  Messrs Radcliffe and Rickman have an impressive scene together as Professor Snape ruthlessly attempts to train Harry to resist Voldemort's violent encroachments into his mind.<br /><br />Series newcomer Evanna Lynch makes a positive impression as Luna Lovegood, the offbeat sweetheart whose odd pronouncements always carry an ironic kernel of wisdom.  It's a difficult part to play believably, and Ms. Lynch does so extremely well.<br /><br />""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is very, very good."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Forget about the facts that this movie is low budget and the acting is mediocre, although Kirk Cameron's performance was pretty good.  Take this movie for what it is, a message about marriage and what it should be.  The issues and problems of marital relationships are very real in this film.  If more men would set aside their own personal wants & desires and give everything they have to their wives then a movie like Fireproof would never have to be made.  Buy this for yourself and when you're done give it to a friend in need.<br />By the way, this review was written by a husband.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I haven't laugh out loud in along time but Jeff Dunham can certainly do this and more. He is a great artist. His puppets, aka his friends, are unique and funny. This DVD is worth buying.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	He is so funny. I love all his characters. You forget that he is doing the voices for all of them. You start to believe they are real.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	My entire family loves this movie and can't get enough!  I watched twice in one day just to enjoy a good, funny, clean, family friendly movie!  Our favorite character is by far, Tow Mater!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	We previewed this at our church before it came out on video and as always  Amazon.com is a couple dollars cheaper than anyone else.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	Let me start of by saying that I am a HUGE Indiana Jones fan, so, needless to say, when they announced a fourth one, I FLIPPED OUT!  Of course, the movie was a disappointment, even with my low expectations (Yes, even though I couldn'twait to see it, my expectations were low).<br /><br />One thing that I did not like about this film was about how often the famous whip was used. It was hardly used after the noteworthy first scene.  Also, there is no love-hate relationship! How can it be Indiana Jones and NOT have a love-hate relationship.  I also found the ending of the movie pretty senseless.  It cuts from a shot of Indy, Mutt, and Marion overlooking the newly flooded and destroyed temple to a wedding back in the States.  My advice: After they escape the temple with the aliens, leave the theater.<br /><br />Something else that I gfound plain stupid was that Indiana Jones survived a nuclear blast by hiding in a partly lead refrdgerator!  Another major mistake in the film, and it was probably the worst, was, well, let's put it this way: UFOs and aliens do NOT belong in an Indiana Jones film!!!<br />Also, the plot was sort of confusing, and it gave you hardly any time to rest once it got started.  Finally, the skull itself seemes to be weightless.  It was supposed to be made out of pure crystal, yet it gets literally tossed around like it's a plastic skull with syran wrap crinkled up inside it (It looked like it, and I can almost gaurntee that that was what the makers of the film made it out of).<br /><br />I must give the makers their props, however, for not putting in too much CGI for this day and age, and I found the part where a snake was used as a rope to be funy, though I found it hard to believe it was a rat snake and that it would not have torn in half.<br /><br />Overall, this was an embrassment to the Indiana Jones triology.  I, as a dedicated fan, am ashamed to call this an Indiana Jones film.

B0006989TE	4.0	b	"Before M. Night Shyamalan morphed into the Rod Serling of movies, he made very funny and clever short amateur films. Why do I bring this up? Because Shyamalan's film plays like an extended version of ""The Twilight Zone"" and his amateur films were imitations of the film directors he admired (Spielberg for one). You may figure out ""The Village"" before the end like I did but even if you figure out the ending, ""The Village"" remains a suspeneful ride for its duration.<br /><br />Set in an isolated, small rural town with homes straight out of the early 18th century, ""The Village"" the people live in is surround by woods where mythical beasts live. The townspeople and the creatures developed an alliance early on; the peole of the village will never venture into the woods and, in turn, the creatures will remain in the woods. As long as this balance exists, the two can peacefully co-exist. Things change with the death of a little boy. When the death occurs Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)offers to brave the woods and go to the nearest town for vitally needed medicines. Ivy Hunt (the marvelous Bryce Dallas Howard who gives a wonderful performance)is the only other person in the town thaan Lucius who seems without fear. Ivy's blindness also gives her a unique perception of others. The elders of the town including Edward Walker (William Hurt), August Nicholson (Brendan Gleeson) and Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) all seem against the idea of leaving the village particularly when the creatures start showing up in the village at night. It seems as if their fragile truce and existence will be coming to an end.<br /><br />A well constructed suspense thriller ""The Village"" shares much in common with Shyamalan's other thrillers ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs""). Although the formula of at the heart of his films might be wearing a bit thin for critics, filmgoers will enjoy ""The Village"" for the atmospheric world that Shyamalan dreams up. The suspenseful pacing, twists & turns in the plot and strong performances by the cast will make ""The Village"" memorable. It's a worthwhile film even if a bit predictable by the conclusion of the film. I have to give Shyamalan credit he reveals a key plot point 2/3rds through the movie not unlike Hitchcock did with his classic film ""Vertigo"". It takes tremendous self confidence and as the plot finally begins to take shape, audiences will appreciate it (although some will be mad just as they were at Hitchcock when he made his classic film).<br /><br />The DVD comes with a whole host of special features including deleted scenes, a production photo gallery, Bryce Dallas Howard reading from the diary she kept on set during production and a documentary (broken down into a number of smaller ""featurettes"") called ""Deconstructing The Village"" that takes the viewer step-by-step through the production of the film. We learn, for example, why an early version of the creatures (aka ""Those We Don't Speak Of"")was abandoned as an onset effect. Shyamalan also shares some of his ideas on what makes a movie suspenseful and the cast discusses the symbolism of ""The Village"" and ""Those That We Don't Speak Of"". Shyamalan, like a lot of film directors (most notably Steven Spielberg) didn't want to do a commentary track perhaps fearing tht it might rob the film of its mystique. It's a pity as his working methods during production and abandoned early concepts would have been particularly interesting and wouldn't have hurt the film at all.<br /><br />Take the wooded path and stop in at ""The Village"" where the world isn't quite what it seems. Rod Serling would be proud of the twists, turns and symbolism in ""The Village"" and that's high praise, indeed. Thanks to Buena Vista Home Video and amazon.com for providing me with an early review copy. The film prompted much discussion among my family at the conclusion."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Kepted me on the edge of my seat! I can't wait for part two To see how it all ends.<br />Like all the Potter movies it does not disapoint!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"Jeff Dunham is one of the few ""stand-out"" comedians we have at this time. His comedic routines and creative characters are highly entertaining. Peanut is the hands down favorite!!!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"We don't watch this every day, of course, but my five year-old son would be happy if we did.  We moved into a new, furnished house recently and put our old dvd player in storage. Unfortunately, our copy of ""Cars"" was in it at the time and rendered inaccessible for the moment.  I purchased this copy because we just couldn't do without it. My son asks for it every day.  Naturally I've seen it a thousand times at this point, but even though it's not my favorite Pixar film, it is still pretty great and it holds up to multiple viewings. The story is good (as is always the case with Pixar), there are lots of little extra touches (look for the VW ""bugs"" on the flourescent lights), and even my two year old gets excited about the race scenes.<br /><br />I like that the BluRay combo has a regular DVD as well, because when we get our BluRay player out of storage, we can use that, but for now the regular DVD works too, and it means we really have three copies:  the one stuck in our old player, and these two. Considering how often we watch the film, we may need them!"
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Evreyone who said this movie was creepy was an idiot. this is actully one of the best christmas movies ever.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Received this product quickly and it was in excellent condition.  No issues at all and wouldn't hesitate to order again from this seller.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	There are no words to describe how happy I was, after seeing this film. There are no stuipid love triangles and no friggin P.C. casting, character creation or issues. There's tons of wonderful violence and super hot babes. This is just what the movie industry needed.
B002VRZEYM	2.0	b	How else do you feed 310 million Americans without charging $50 for a 5 lb bag of potato's? Cattle naturally were grass eaters yes but why assume corn does not serve man's modern needs. Man was created to walk or run do we give up driving, flying, riding bicycles etc..etc..I thought. Individually I might consider organic for better health but can appreciate our need for these process efficencies.<br />I thought the scene with the field  processing of organic small farm chickens especially funny. Imagine how much chicken would cost our 310 million citizens if thats how all our chickens were raised and processed. Sad to say I think we really have no choice, Food, Inc is here to stay. Did I mention 1.3 BILLION Chineese?
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	After all the hype surrounding this movie, I found it didn't live up to all the fanfare surrounding it.  I wasn't too impressed with it and felt disappointed after watching it.  Most movies I watch and feel this way, I tend to keep my initial reaction even after trying it for a second time.  This movie, however, I have grown to like more after the second and third time watching.  I don't feel I appreciated the acting as much the first time, because I kept comparing it to other movies the actors in it have made, and felt let down.  I didn't give it justice for its own movie, separate from all the many others they have made.  The ending still is not my favorite, but the rest of it is action-packed.<br /><br />Leonardo Dicaprio has easily turned into one of my favorite actors.  Though he has been in movies I didn't care for (the other one with Kate Winslet that is not Titanic), most of his movies I am taken aback by how great his acting is.  It really helps add to the movie, and I have come to appreciate it a lot more.  Though he has been nominated and won some Oscars, he may be one of the most under-appreciated actors out there.  Matt Damon is another I have quickly grown to like, though his character I don't feel any remorse for at all in the movie.<br /><br />I love the intensity in which both of the two main undercovers played their respective character.  It made me feel scared for Leo and I could see how torn he was in his predicament.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Hollywood has welcomed a lot of great mob films (""The Godfather"" trilogy,""Goodfellas"",etc.),and a great addition to that genre of films has proven itself to be,by far,""The Departed"".<br /><br />Based in Boston (mostly South Boston,one of the most famous mob places in the world),this film focuses on several different characters. It begins with a good depiction of Matt Damon's character in this film,Colin Sullivan. While Colin did have an unhappy childhood (I won't give away too much of that--that is something for you to discover when you watch this film for the first time),the one man he had to get him through his childhood was Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson),a Boston mob moss who has politely welcomed Colin into his organization,with Colin and Frank remaining friends ever since they first met. For Colin and Frank,this is a trusted friendship that helps the both of them in the long run.<br /><br />But,what is the one problem that lingers here? The problem is that Frank Castello has commited several crimes and is wanted badly by the Boston police,who who will do anything to stop him. Their luck comes along when two important Boston cops,a boss on the force named Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen)and a sergeant named Dignam(Mark Wahlberg)hire a man named Billy Costigan(Leonardo DiCaprio),who has lost his family and is an unsuccessful person. His job? To go undercover and become a member of Frank Costello's mob,in order for him to be able to help the Boston police bust Frank Costello (something that is a very difficult task for them). Once the investigation has begun and trouble has stirred up in both the Boston Police Department and Frank Costello's mob as a result of the investigation,can the good guys win,or will that honor go to the bad guys? Only time will tell!!!<br /><br />When it comes down to ""The Departed"",while this film is VERY long (close to the same amount of time that ""JFK"" and ""The Good Shepherd"" were)and is complicated and hard to follow,on top of those two flaws,it is an excellent film. The plot for this film is very smart while it has a great scipt accompanying it. As for the performances,Matt Damon turns in a good performance while Leonardo DiCaprio allows the film to be interesting,and gives in an entertaining performance. But,the performances here that are REALLY worth watching are the performances of Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg. Nicholson brings a lot of suspense and drama into his performance,and allows viewers get to know his character and helps bring the film to life. As for Mark Wahlberg's performance,Wahlberg turns in one of the finest performances of his career here,as a no nonscence cop who plays it out tough until the very end. With his performance,not only does Mark Wahlberg contribute to this film's essence and success,at the same time,he allows his talent to continue to improve as an actor. Also,Martin Scorsese leads this film in a smart manner that will make one guessing until the very end,which is the main factor in this film being so well-planned and being the good film that it is.<br /><br />The only minor flaw for this DVD is that the only extra feauture here is a theatrical trailer for this film. But,if you want to see a good amount of special feautures for this film,you will want to skip this DVD and get the two-disc Special Edition DVD that was released for this film--which has good bonus feautures that one would want and except on and with this DVD.<br /><br />If you are a fan of mob films,""The Departed"" is a must-see film. It is one of the best films to ever have been made and released. It has everything a good film needs (a great plot,a great script,a great cast,great acting,and a great director),and will probably continue to make an influence on film fans over the years,the same kind of influence that other mob films like ""Goodfellas"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" have. What you have here is a fine work of art.<br /><br />5/5"
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	One of the five best movies I've ever seen.  Simply astonishing.  There is no background music.  Doesn't need any.  Measured, even, slow-paced.  Great.
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	The parallel story of a police informant within a Boston gang and a gang informant within the police.  Well filmed and generally acted well, this film is nonetheless over-rated.  The plot is excessively complex with realism sacrificed in the interest of making the stories of the 2 informants parallel.  This allows a lot of well done cross-cutting between plot lines but strains credulity.  Some of the dialogue verges on self-parody.  Most of the principals and supporting cast do well but Jack Nicholson's performance as an evil Nietzschean egoist is rank scenery chewing.  The French Connection this isn't.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This movie is very informative; you will definitely be much more informed after watching this movie! It's my belief that everyone who eats food should see it.

B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"When my dad asked me to order this DVD for him, I didn't know what to expect.  When I ordered the DVD, I was allowed to watch it instantly online as well, so I did, and wow! What can I say?  I've known for a long time that there were problems with the way food is produced in this country--the increasingly frequent outbreaks of e. coli and salmonella are indication enough of that--but this documentary revealed things that were surprising even to me.  Yet, even as the documentary shows you the good, the bad, and the ugly of our food industry, they manage to do so in a way that doesn't come off as preachy or condescending.  You journey through several different farms, from huge, stifling factory farms to an ""old-fashioned"" farm where cattle still eat grass and the chickens still see sunlight.  You meet farmers that have been put impossibly deep in debt by the demands of the industry that contracted them, honest people that were prosecuted and denied their livelihood when they committed no crime, and a mother who lost her son to tainted meat and continues to fight for stronger regulation of the industry.  You're shown the facts about where our food comes from, how it's made, and how it reaches us, and at the end there is a very simple message--by shopping smarter and choosing food that has been produced humanely and sustainably, we have the power to change the food industry for the better.<br /><br />I highly recommend this documentary."

B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	I like the movie. I surprised that even atheist even get fired. how ever scientist that got tenured or stay in the closet do not get fired. But one thing for sure Darwinist get mad at any one who has evidence against evolution and in favor of a counter theory. Ben could done better. He could interview Dr Sanford. He is geneticist and could provide much needed TESTABLE evidence to the movie. I high encourage you to read genetic entropy & mystery of the genome. The problem Ben stein did not know of Dr Sanford work. Most people don't. It way most scientist think Neo Darwinian evolution is even possible.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LAIHY0"">Prometheus (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy)</a><br /><br />I will say on it's own merits, the movie is good but not great. There are many theories about what RS was REALLY trying to say about who the Engineers were. I won't get into that because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.<br /><br />I think if you're a fan of religious studies or mythology, you will be able to see certain patterns and read in between the lines, at least enough to realize certain themes, and that no info, plot point, date, or number given is a mere coincidence but rather a reference to someone else to help give subtext to the story.<br /><br />While I enjoy the movie quite a bit, more so the second viewing, I was left wondering if RS edited himself and the story he intended to tell to have the answers be in future movies, or because he was afraid of the backlash from religious fanatics if he outright said what he wanted to say.<br /><br />On a different note, the movie is visually fantastic and stunning. The sense of scale is literally awesome, and it does a great job of showing us how puny us as humans really are."

B001684L0A	5.0	b	There's not a lot to say other than all Americans and those who wish to be should see this movie. From all my research, much of the known story-line is accurate. At the same time it educates one about one of our nation's primary Founders, it's also entertaining, very well acted, and a joy to watch.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	arrived on time, was in good shape and just what i wanted and as advertised. the insanity work out video was great and a good thing to have.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"Snow White and the Huntsman is a film that captivates and excites the viewer within two hours and seven minutes.  And to add to the excitement, the main premise of the film that involves the classic fairytale character Snow White (Kristen Stewart) and a slightly different band of seven dwarves.  Along with Snow White, the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth), who was called to capture Snow White and return her to Ravenna (Charlize Theron), the evil queen who is on the never ending quest for immortality; she preys on unsuspecting individuals and literally breathes the life out of them in order for her to maintain her youthful beauty.  However, Ravenna appears to possess vanity to the extreme, especially as she seeks guidance from Mirror Man (Christopher Obi).  Director Rupert Sanders adds an enormous twist from the original classic fairytale but not without subtly maintaining elements in the film that viewers will most likely identify.<br /><br />The title of the film may reveal much about the story of Snow White but diverts from the original story as well as the Disney film.  If viewers thought the Disney classic was dark and scary, especially as a child, one may see this adaptation rather more similar to the ""Harry Potter"" meets ""Lord of the Rings"" with a slight dabble of special effects on the ""Terminator"" side; it is the special effects and the cinematography that help to emphasize the dramatic and darker scenes in the film.  But in between the darker shades, there are lighter shades but rather brief when Snow White escapes the dark forest and encounters the seven dwarves terrain.  However, if one is looking for a classic song of ""high ho"" or birds singing along with Stewart, they will be disappointed; there are fairies and a deer-like creature that offers a hopeful moment for Snow White that is quite reminiscent of the Narnia films.  But the conflict ensues once more when Ravenna's brother Finn (Sam Spruell) and her henchman Aldan (Joey Ansah) wreak havoc and start a battle of flying arrows through the forest.  The film contains several battle scenes, but the most intense scene is the ultimate battle between good and evil, Snow White in her somewhat Joan of Arc regalia and Ravenna as a ""black swan.""<br /><br />But as viewers will see with a story involving good versus evil, it is undeniable of what side will prevail.  Snow White and the Huntsman is a riveting film that may have viewers at the edge of their seat because although one may already know about the story of Snow White, this adaptation has unpredictable and surprising moments.  Indeed, a film recommended for viewers with an imagination."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"Definitely a keeper!<br /> A fun filled Family Movie with a powerful message about friendship, ego, & teamwork... This is a nice movie, appropriate for all ages - no glarring issues that would be of concern to even the most conservative parent... Of course there will be those that deconstruct the movie from the outside in - basing their comments on the ""realness"" of the movie - for example: the lack of people in the movie makes it unrealistic b/c the cars couldn't build the race tracks, buildings, etc... well yes that's true - but cars also can't talk or have relationships or go out tractor tipping either ... this isn't a movie based in reality... it's just a laugh out loud, very cute movie, with wonderful animation - The whole family enjoyed this movie. So grab some popcorn, pile up with your family & enjoy this one! (It's nice to have movies that you can pop into the dvd player, sit back & relax without being concerned about what may or may not appear on the screen...)"
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Tommy Lee Jones plays the sheriff of a small town in Texas who, as he gets older, realizes the world is a changing place, and he may not be strong nor courageous enough to keep running with it. He is a career lawman, carrying on the tradition of his father and grandfather, playing it safe as he nears closer and closer to retirement.<br /><br />  Josh Brolin plays a local married, middle-class man who, while out hunting one hot day in the barren Texas landscape, comes across the remains of a drug-deal-gone-wrong. He comes across the drug money ($2 million) and plans a retirement for himself and his wife.<br /><br />  Javier Bardem plays a soulless maniac who will kill anyone who gets in his way in order to get that money. Once he discovers Brolin has taken the money, his pursuit grows more and more violent.<br /><br />  Meanwhile, while Brolin stays one step ahead of Bardem, Jones stays one step back, feeling overmatched and unable to provide any safety or deliver any justice.<br /><br />  In the end, death and violence prevail, as they have done more and more through the years.<br /><br />  The Coen brothers have done a fascinating job; the cast provide stellar, solid performances. The hot, dry country is well-captured here, and the empty, subtle soundscape provides a powerful contrast to the full-blown violence lurking within Bardem's character.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I have been a huge fan of Martin Scorsese for as long as I can remember, probably as long as I've been watching movies. In regard to The Departed, you can make the valid argument that it pales in comparison to his previous masterpieces: Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, etc. However, the visceral energy sucks you in from the onset and carries you throughout a savagely brutal saga of more people getting shot in the head point blank than has ever been committed to celluloid. More importantly, Scorsese's overdue coronation by the Academy with Speilberg, Coppola and Lucas presenting his Best Director trophy was the higlight of watching the Oscar ceremony for 13 years. If you are new to the canon of Scorsese's films, I would suggest starting out on his earlier works, especially Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and Raging Bull before watching The Departed or any of his later pictures. Either way, you'll experience film making by a true genius, who are in short supply these days.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"Even though the screen version is different than the books, I still say to watch this.  I am reading the books and Sookie and Bill are great together! I would suggest reading the books before the 3rd season of ""True Blood""."
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	"I guess I shouldn't be surprised. As you know, Warner Brothers has officially announced the Ultimate Editions of years 5 and 6. The product descriptions are quite wordy. There's a lot of talk about how fans should be excited about these new releases. But there are two words missing from the descriptions of both these products: Extended. Cut.<br /><br />These are the words that sold me in the beginning. The promise of seeing extended cuts of the HP films was enough for me (and many, MANY other fans) to double dip and get the Ultimate SS and CoS Blu-rays. And you know what? There were worth it. Not because of the endless array of worthless swag packed into over-size boxes. I mean, seriously... Anybody out there framing their lenticular cards and hanging them over their mantles? I didn't think so. But I digress...<br /><br />What sold me and so many other fans was the extended cuts. And so I began collecting the Ultimate Editions. And what excited me even more was the idea of more extended cuts to come, especially for The Order of the Phoenix.<br /><br />Then PoA and GoF Ultimate Editions came out, and of course, there were no extended cuts. And Warner Bros. spun us a tale of directors and their creative preferences. And so, we all said ""fair enough"" (although I, for one, never quite bought that explanation). Still, I had hopes for OotP and HBP. Director David Yates is on record talking about having to cut 45 minutes from The Order of the Phoenix. And yet, here we are again with no extended cut to speak of. I'm sure the studio will spin us a tale of how busy Yates has been with the final installment of the franchise, thus making it impossible to return to these previous films and give the fans what they want: An official ultimate collector's replica of a square of Hogwart's Toilet Paper.<br /><br />Oh, I meant AN EXTENDED CUT.<br /><br />Now, I understand Warner Bros. desire to get these editions on the shelves before the final film hits theaters. As for me, I would gladly wait a year for these editions if it meant getting to see extended cuts of the films. But this is not about the fans. This is about the bottom line. If the WB can get a half-@$$ product onto the shelves sooner, and therefore presumably make more money in the final season of Potter movie mania, then who cares what the fans want? We will buy anything with the word Ultimate in front of it. Or maybe not."
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	very disappointing after having enjoyed the previous movies so much.  appears they just threw a bunch of long drawn out scenes on film to extract more cash from all the potter fans.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	What a GREAT movie for children and adults alike.  This is one that every home should have in their DVD collection.  It is sure to be a CLASSIC.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	I heard that this movie sucked so I did'nt go to the theaters so I rented it and I liked it something that was different and new I would like to see them make another. but like I said only A true fan would like it like the new star wars movies episode three sucked but I still bought it so as a hard core fan I liked it nothing like the origanal.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	Things I liked; it was better than GoF, the acting keeps getting better with every film, the ministry fights with the Order/Death Eaters and Voldemort/Dumbledore were great, I love the effects they use on the spells. Dolores Umbridge was a biatttchh, part played well. The music was good as well.<br /><br />What I didn't like; the beginning...the entire part up until they get inside the order's house was just horrible, the dementors looked silly, the acting was bad, the camera shots, everything. Luckily the film picks up and gets better.<br /><br />Not a good book adaption, a lot of good things were left out...but whatever. I've watched it three times so far so it's good enough for my enjoyment, I can always read the book again.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I think this is the best Harry Potter movie so far, and that's saying a lot because I loved the first one.  Some of the ones after that have been disappointing but this one delivers!
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"These movies just get better and better with each new one. I was really impressed with the acting in this movie. Also, the story itself was quite good. For what is supposed to be a ""children's movie"", it had some very grown up scenes. I thought this movie was handled very well, and it is bringing the series to more a darker tone, which is necessary for the next 2 movies. Bravo to all involved in the Order of the Phoenix."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Fireproof is a very well-made movie from a Christian perspective.  It deals with a typical young couple who are totally consumed with themselves and headed for divorce.  But as they learn to serve one another through the power of Christ, their lives change radically.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Awesome documentary and very eye opening!!<br />Don't be afraid to watch this movie you will be grateful you did.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	Well, where to begin.<br />We all understand this is the classic story of the young girl imprisoned by her evil stepmother and blah blah blah.  That, in and of itself, might be a reason to give this movie a miss, even though Charlize Theron is quite good as the evil queen.  It is nonetheless a tale which has been told countless times in one form or another and there is nothing new or remarkable about this telling.<br /><br />The biggest problem here is Kristen Stewart who, for the most part, makes her way through the movie looking as though she has a bad case of hemorrhoids.  Her acting is wooden, unengaging and she brings nothing to the character that I could connect with.  She spends the entire film with a pouty look on her face which changes only slightly as she segues from one near-disaster to another.  There is no breadth or depth to her character.  In fairness to Stewart, her acting might be the result of poor direction, but whatever the reason she is just not very good.<br /><br />The film is beautifully filmed and has the usual dose of special effects, especially for the villains.  Unfortunately, the special effects seemed a bit out of place with some of the villains looking like they had been borrowed from the set of a science fiction film.  I think special effects are over-rated but in this film they seemed somewhat out of place.<br /><br />Save your money.  Rent it if you must, but it is not worthy of a place on anyone's shelf.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"I purchased this Blu-Ray movie from BB. I was worried about the ""loading"" issues many people have talked about on Amazon as well as other forums. Well I found out that only the initial shipment of Iron Man Blu-Ray suffered from problems loading. The disc attempts to connect online via the PS3 and download content from a server onto your players hard-drive. People were having issues because (1) the servers were over-loaded and (2) the initial batch of discs would attempt to download content without asking for permission first.<br /><br />The discs have all been replaced and now upon insertion, you will be asked if you want to connect online and download content. I selected ""YES"" and 1.5 minutes later, I was in the menu ready to watch the movie.<br /><br />The movie is fantastic and well worth the purchase! Robert D Jr. gives a perfect performance and the special effects will blow your mind.<br /><br />Don't worry about anything and pick it up! You'll love it!<br /><br />Movie: A<br />Transfer Quality: A+<br />Menu: B+<br />Packaging: B<br />Audio: A-<br />Extra Features: B+"
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	I hesitated on renting this one because my husband didn't want to watch it, but he was out of town, so I did!  I really liked this version of the story of Snow White and I loved the interesting creatures in the forest they encountered with the dwarves.  Excellent picture quality and playback on my PS3 as well.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	A good product with a lower price. The only problem is about the box with a terrible lock. It is very difficult to open!<br /><br />Anyways if you like this movie get yours now!
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	BEWARE! I just (tried) to watch my copy, and I was shocked that my feature film disc was defected. The error starts at the scene when Indy is being interrogated by his double crosser friend, whatshisname, and then the picture freezes, and it continues only when I skip the movie with the button, and the next playable scene is when the old guy starts to auto write. Well, I'm quite dissapointed, not just by this outrageously mediocre sequel to a glorious franchise, but the idea, that this is my very first defected blu-ray disc. I wouldn't have watched Indy IV. many times anyway, but now that my disc is broken, I'm pissed. Please watch your copy to be sure, yours doesn't have a problem, because it may also well be a serial mistake. Well, now my remaining enthusiasm towards the new Indiana Jones-flick has faded.
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	wow glad i did not buy the dvd this was a over rated pumped up movie. short plot low budget retarded ending. how about that background music in the trailer. Sigourney Weaver laughed at this one.
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	"I can not see why Scorsese won an Oscar for this movie. I mean I like Scorsese's other movies especially ""Goodfellas"", but this movie was not very good. The whole plot of the movie is interesting but the way the movie was made really did not work very well. The weird background music and the unnecessary cursing and tension between Mark Wahlberg's and Leonardo DiCaprio's character really made this movie hard to watch. I also dislike the fact that these Irish mafia guys are never really established as mafia guys. You don't see any really interesting stuff going on with these Irish mob guys. If you are the type of person that likes cool gangster movies you will be disappointed when you see this film. I really tried to like this movie but,I found myself waiting for it to be over. This has been the worst recent movie I have seen."
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	"I just watched this movie on HBO and was extremely puzzled and disappointed. Disappointed because I could not follow the confusing plot at all. Flashbacks and generally choppy editing made it impossible to get drawn into this plot. Puzzled because I have no idea why Martin Scorsese got an Academy Award for this film, except (as popular belief holds) it was finally ""his time"" and they decided to give him one before he died. This movie made no sense and is full of pointless profanities and violence.<br /><br />To me, the movie mainly serves as a signal that Jack Nicholson needs to find a different part to play other than Jack Nicholson. In this movie, he just plays what he's been playing for 20 or 30 years now -- some sarcastic, bitter SOB who is totally evil. Then he collects his fat paycheck for another ""acting"" job.<br /><br />Avoid this movie! It's all hype and little payoff."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"I was skeptical when I first started viewing ""Expelled."" First off, it seemed to be promoting Intelligent Design (ID), which I haven't seen too much good press about ever. Second, Ben Stein has shown recently that his politics are too pragmatic (and thus less idealistic) for my taste. But as the documentary progressed, complete with interviews between Ben Stein and numerous bearded scientists, it became clear that the picture wasn't about ID, it was about academic freedom specifically, and liberty generally. Also, from solely viewing this documentary, Stein provides a shining example of a pure libertarian, a quality that everyone should be able to respect and support regardless of their political persuasion. The showcase of this piece is an interview with Richard Dawkins, which shows him basically giving proof for Intelligent Design (though his intelligence is a far-off alien species, not God), and a dramatic parrellel drawn between the Berlin wall and the artificial wall separating ID scientists from the rest of the scientific community."
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	There are plenty of lengthy reviews here so I'll try to keep it simple.<br /><br />I've seen a lot of various opinions of the content in the movie, but if you liked or disliked anything you saw it's a film you'll want to talk about for hours after seeing it.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This guy is amazing!!!  This is one of the funniest videos I have seen in a long time.  This is a must get!!!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	After hearing about Jeff Dunham from a co worker, I viewed some performances on a well known web site. But then I wanted the DVD and purchased it on Amazon. The price was right and it is so worth it, we cant get enough of this guy. Not only is his ventriloquizm act great, he does a stand up in the begining that is very good too.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"""I Don't Know About You But I'am Having a Ball!"" - Marv<br /><br />Sin City is one of the best movies to come out in a while. It's visually stunning and fun to watch. The characters are larger then life and fun to follow throughout the movie. This movie is Rodriquez's Pulp Fiction. Using Frank Miller's character's and story, he creates a movie you can watch over and over again. Mickey Rourke is perfect and is without a doubt the best character in the film. This movie has it all. Great action, Comedy, Story, Acting, and eye candy. Buy this movie and visit Sin City!"
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Prometheus was such an amazing experience, I can't wait to buy the BluRay to see the special features and extended scenes.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	This show seems to have some weird (vampiric gaze?) over viewers that misleads them into thinking it is a great show.  It could have been so much more, but being rooted in the bad source material  is it's greatest foil, I'd have to say.  Some of the acting, including the star, is below what I'd expect from a show with a budget this large.  As a regular HBO subscriber I was looking forward to this show; only to be bored by episode three at the inane plot and meaningless direction of many of the characters and the MTV/slasher/rockstar depiction of some of the 'bad' vampires.  A far better choice would have been to use the extremely superior Ann Rice series or Fevre Dream for a vampire setting; True Blood truly stinks.<br /><br />HBO, oh how the mighty have fallen. The Wire: gone. Deadwood: Gone. The Sopranos: Fuhgetaboutit.  Hopefully they'll redeem themselves with The Pacific later this year and with A Song of Ice and Fire in the future.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	While Crystal skull won't be remembered as the best Indiana Jones picture, it certainly isn'nt the worst. I enjoyed it anyway, but the scenes which were shot at Yale University in New Haven, CT was of special interest to me since both my father graduated from there, and I grew up near that area, and had seen Yale University many tiimes.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	Stating the good stuff in the movie: the acting and the cinematography. The bad stuff. There's nothing scary about the movie, unless you think the frightnening music is scary. The creatures look like giant sewer rats.<br /><br />Shyamalan seems to think he can make any movie and the audience will fall for it. The Village is an example of this. The only merit of this movie is the actors and setting. The story goes nowhere.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	if you have kids that love car movies then they should definitly buy this movie because i'm positive that once they see this movie, they'll want to watch it over and over again. the story has a moral that all kids should pay attention to and cars is a must see for elders too. this movie takes you for the ride of your life. don't miss it !!!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	THIS IS THE FUNNYEST STUFF I SEEN IN LONG TIME,<br /><br />EXCELLENT CHOICE !
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"As unforgivable and atrocious as Mr. Stein's butchering of the scientific establishment was, it does give great insight into the misunderstandings and intellectual shortcomings of people in his league. I had often wondered, how can it be that these people are so defiant in their endeavors. How can people posit such a horrible argument publicly and with pride? Is it an act of ignorance? Is it a willful subversion of truth for benefit of an agenda? Can it be both?<br /><br />First of all, it's important to recognise this argument for what it is. This isn't the typical hopeless debate of trying to prove and disprove the existence of god or a higher power. It's a debate about the scientific standing of what is explicitly not scientific. Here we go...<br /><br />Communication is far more than words, it's where the conversation has been, where it's going, and all the connotative subtleties that might be taken for granted by the professor but not just overlooked by the audience, but twisted and misunderstood. Lets say one person asks another, ""Where do you think humans come from?"" and the other says, ""Well I don't know for certain, but most investigation's observations are explained with a theory of evolution."", to which the original inquirer retorts, ""I think it's silly believe that an ape gave birth to a man."" At this point something very strange and very subtle occurs that changes the very nature of the conversation and usually without anyone taking notice. The naturalist is now tasked with correcting this misconception. They have to explain and correct this common misconception because they understand it is not actually a valid criticism of evolutionary theory, but a manifestation of ignorance. Undoubtedly, the inquisitor will see such contention to be just as dogmatic as their own fantastic religious indoctrinations and in light of this will place the two on equal standing. What I'm suggesting is, the moment two people of unequaled understandings clash the fact that the naturalist isn't trying to posit the theory of evolution as dogmatic truth of the universe (like religious creation) is lost in the background noise. The creationist doesn't understand this distinction because they don't understand the nature of scientific discovery, they are used to dogmatic answers for these questions.<br /><br />It is this very misguided but innocent perception that causes people like Ben Stein to see evolution and ID as interchangeable and of equal intellectual standing. I think it is this confusion that Ben Stein bases his entire three ring circus on. He doesn't have any conceptual understanding of science and is therefor unaware of Intelligent Design's irrelevance to science. Scientists don't have to be atheists but science certainly is. Supernatural stories (and I refuse to use the word theory since ID is not a theory in the scientific sense) can not be tested and are therefor excluded as irrelevant to science, not by dogmatic authority, but by the their default failure within the scientific method. This isn't the consious act of angry atheists dominating scientific debate, but the understanding of science, common to scientists around the world regardless of their personal philosophies.<br /><br />I suggest the only way to avoid this is to be humble. Everyone, by default, knows nothing of theory of evolution, or even science in general. We all must learn about it. So, I wouldn't beg the question, ""Why is it that 50% of American's don't accept the theory of evolution?"" The more impending one would be, ""Why do 50% of Americans think they are familiar enough with the theory to have an opinion of it?"" or, ""Why do people feel as if they must make a decision about something they don't know anything about?"" When I was younger and I was exploring the world for truth on these issues (as I continue to do) I did what none of the Expelled crew seemed to do, and more importantly what they forgot to tell their audience to do. I researched the material. I read about evolution in many different places and from the perspective of many academic and philosophical disciplines.<br /><br />I came upon this realization while watching a TED talk of Daniel Dennett's. An incredible philosopher, he talks of our extremely defensive nature when it comes to suggesting that consciousness might not be what you think it is. You would take offense if one were to suggest that the world is not as you perceive it. After all isn't it suggesting insanity in so many words? But, we are all guilty of cognitive dissonance in one way or another. In fact it seems like a rather necessary function of our ontology. We know atoms are made up of mostly empty space yet we need to continue with our earthly models of solids, liquids, and gases, but those are just a sampling of reality. The most dense rock or crystal you can imagine is in actuality mostly empty space. So you see, cognitive dissonance is nothing to be ashamed of, but instead an extremely powerful thing to be aware of and that is my contention.<br /><br />It's very important to always ask questions. Not only, ""Why does that happen?"" but ""How does this happen?"" and its ancillary ""How do I know this is happening?"" Once we're aware then we can evaluate just how much of our life is cognitively dissonant and most importantly evaluate whether this dissonance is a hindrance or a necessity. In my eyes, this is essentially the disposition of what I'd like the word atheist to mean, or at least what I stand for. For it's this awareness by which I shave god from my ontology with Occam's Razor.<br /><br />Up until this point I've been giving Mr. Stein the benefit of the doubt. I can now understand how someone of Ben's calibre could be stuck on such a ridiculous misunderstanding but there are other problems this does not reconcile. From reviews and critiques of the movie including the narratives of both Richard Dawkins and PZ Myers it becomes clear that Ben Stein and Co. have brought their irrationality to several other fronts as well. When considering the accusations of Myers ""gate crashing"", the specious solicitation of interviews, and the egregious misquotations of Darwin himself, it becomes clear that this film was intended to be unfair. After all, they expelled someone with alternative views from watching the pre-release showing of a movie that he not only appears in but is thanked for during the end credits.<br /><br />Mr. Steins film Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed is an underhanded attack on the very nature of scientific progression and discovery, its methods, logic, and reason. The misunderstandings and outright lies that this movie will deposit in its undoubtably ignorant audience has the potential to set back our society's grasp of sciences for years to come.<br /><br />Mr. Stein, Intelligent Design wasn't expelled from science class, it was flunked."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	There are many who feel as though this movie has no elaborate ending, which is true, however the ending is suitable. The ending is perfect. Without trying to type out the perfection of this movie I will add that after watching the second time consider the title of the movie...<br /><br />This may be one of the best movies ever.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	My wife and I had high hopes for this film, but it sort of fell short (now I'm glad we weren't able to find time to see it in the theaters)<br /><br />The only actor of any caliber is Charlize Theron and it shows.  Kristin Stewart is wooden and Chris Hemsworth, while good in Thor, The Avengers, (and what little we saw him) and StarTrek does not pull it off here - he seems like he doesn't want to be here, like he's contractually obligated to act in the movie.<br /><br />The visuals and audio were great in HD and it wasn't a waste of time - it was entertaining - but it could have been so much more.<br /><br />In hindsight I'm not sure I would pay money to see it, but if it happened to come on cable TV on a rainy Saturday afternoon?  Sure.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	This movie had a chance. It really did and honestly is started off well. The plot was a unique twist on the classic fairy tale and all seemed well. Then entered Kristin Stewart as Snow White... Uggh. Hopefully she will be able to purchase some acting lessons with what she made on this movie because breathing heavily and looking sad/confused all the time doesn't make the cut. Its really too bad because Charlize Theron was remarkable as the evil queen and it's a shame to cast a horrendous actress such as Stewart opposite Theron. The only value in watching this movie was that I can now, without a shadow of doubt, save money in the future by avoiding any film with Kristin Stewart in the credits.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	I think that movie makers have to wait till the technology is there to produce a certain movie that might require sophisticated effects and not just wait for a good script and have the technology (if not mature enough) ruin the film.  George Lucas did it with his Star Wars prequels and the producers of Iron Man chose to do it the same way too.  The movie is a combination of a good script (many times side-lined in such movies) and very good special effects.  Robert Downey proved he is a good actor in this movie by getting in the right shape required and as usuall living the role.  Overall another Marvel hit which I'm sure will encourage Marvel to bring more and more of their superheros onto the big screen.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	"I love just about any movie Robert Downey Jr. is in and this is no exception.  Good action movie with a little bit of ""this is unbelievable"".  It's a great family movie.  And who doesn't like a superhero."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Get this in the blu ray version.  It looks alot better than the other version and this is great movie.  Everyone in it does a fantastic job<br />that makes this a awesome movie that is everything a blockbuster should be: Entertaining, fine acting, a solid story,  brilliant effects ,<br />and it has characters that are well rounded.  And jeff bridges who makes a fine villian in this story.  He was always underestimated as a actor and this movie lets him create a believable slimy villian who might be working in any organization.  The movies have finally caught up to my old 1960's comic books in their ability to depict great fantasy heroes.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	The service was great. I got the movie sooner than expected and it was in great condition. My only complaint was that the movie wasnt that good for a Harry Potter movie.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	"Having watched all of the previous Harry Potter movies and read all of the books I am not impressed with this movie.  The fist five movies were very good, but the Half Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows felt very different.  The Deathly Hallows, Part 1 consisted of random scenes splashed together with seemingly no flow to it.  Coupled with Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) mediocre performance, this film is a mess.  With regards to the story, this is a very depressing time for Harry and his friends, but Radcliffe displayed almost no emotion during the entire film.  It's understandable that Harry and his friends would be a bit moody, but there was no passion in Harry's voice, especially for what he and his friends had sacrificed to find the horcruxes (Hermoine was on par and Ron was good as always though).  For example, when Harry was asked if it felt better to take one of the horcruxes from around his neck he quickly said to Hermione ""Loads.""  I didn't sense that his character felt any better for having it away from him because of how he delivered the line.  There was no weight to that scene, and that was not the only one.  Most of the time, Harry just sat there in uncomfortable silence when he was asked a question or spoken to.  I felt myself hoping the characters got through the scenes without messing up their lines.<br /><br />There was an awkward dancing scene along with awkward kissing scenes that added nothing to the film.  For example, Ginny shows up out of no where, Harry and her make out and then that's it...nothing else is spoken about their relationship or anything from the book.  Don't even get me started about the scene with the obviously computer generated half naked Hermoine and Harry walking toward Ron while he is trying to destroy the horcrux....weird!  Strange kissing scene ensues  My last upsetting issue was regarding the dark mood and some of the disturbing scenes (beware parents, I'm sure this movie will give the little ones nightmares - I will not let mine watch this one).  The dark mood is awkwardly peeled away at certain points to let in misplaced humor (noteably by Fred and George).  The Harry Potter series has lost it's fun feel and gone dark big time.  Not really a fan of that change, but I know the story has changed and things are not as they were.  Personally I blame Rowling locking herself up away from her family to write the final Harry Potter books (may or may not be true).  I heard that somewhere and I think that her isolation from her family didn't make for the best material for this book.<br /><br />This is not a bash Radcliffe session as there were others to blame.  Ultimately I blame the director as he could have made the scenes better, especially with transitioning them better.  While I am on the subject and bashing away, let me throw this in.  I say fire the current Harry and replace him with Frodo from Lord of the Rings for the final part 2.  It's easy to explain, Harry did a face changing spell that backfired and is now permanent.  Also, fire the director and get someone talented in there, not one of these dime a dozen ones.  That's my take and I hope you enjoyed it."
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	Buyer beware--the director has already stated there is a expanded 'special edition' coming out in the future.  Do not buy this bare bones DVD if you are a fan of the movie and hate being ripped off by the movie studios!
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	"I have to say that I LOVE the Harry Potter books!!  That said, I also enjoy the movies.  I prefer the books to the movies and have found that it's best NOT to review the books before watching the movies.  I actually try to see the movies with little or no expectations, except they stay true to the book (for me, DO NOT ADD TO THE BOOKS!)  I realize that you have to ""abridge"" the movies for time and effects (there are still a few things they just can't do in the movie that an author can create in the imagination).  Another thing you have to realize when watching these movies is that everyone will imagine things at least slightly differently.  I do, however, agree with the reviewer that said they need to bring back the original director (from the first two movies); the movies seemed to be of better quality overall."
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	This movie has the worst acting, stereotypes, and a hard religious angle that you don't see till about 30 min in.  I thought that at least the storyline would be decent even if the acting is bad....wrong.  Kirk Cameron is a horrible actor, but look decent next too all of these people that wouldn't make my 7th grade play.  I couldn't even finish the movie before I had to write this review and I will not....45min 43sec is all I can take.
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	I went and saw the midnight release of this movie and when it was over, I was disappointed. The book is the longest in the series but it was reduced to the shortest movie. The problem I felt with this movie it is seemed to have a too many changes. For example when Harry's Uncle is speaking to him in the fire it's different. I preferred the special effects for that scene in Goblet of Fire. Not only that the Dementors looked silly in this film, they looked much better in the Prisoner of Azkaban. The other problem I had was the fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort seemed rather cheesy and over too fast.<br /><br />I did however feel this movie was way better then Spider-man 3 and still say that Goblet of Fire is my favorite so far in the series.
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	"I saw this motion picture, 'The Departed,' about a month ago at our Union theater for free (thankfully) and all I can say is... ""Wow, I'm impressed!"" Impressed with, not the movie itself, but with how arrogantly lofty its ratings are. There are five types of viewers who will absolutely adore this movie to the point of sleeping with it underneath their pillows every night while in bed: viewers who love watching other individuals get their heads blown off, followed immediately by the gushing of blood leaking and pouring out of the same location; viewers who are sick and tired of so-called ""happy"" resolutions (trust me, you definitely won't find one of those here so you should be okay); viewers who try to stay away from any movie of less than 2 hours; viewers who enjoy excessive amounts of pointless violence; and finally, viewers who are intolerable movies being ""predictable."" If you are seeing this movie for the first time, and you are trying to figure out what will happen next, then 9 times out of 10, your guess may be less than accurate. I have read enough movie reviews to know what kind of movie will be well-perceived by the public and what kind will be treated like some kind of dangerous black mold or toxic waste; but as for the writer of this review, I personally could care less about any of the five aforementioned categories, so in that sense, I have to stay neutral. The students with whom I saw this film absolutely fell in love with it. My mother and her male friend, on the other hand, saw it months earlier and they didn't seem to think it was all that, and after all the great things that I had heard and read about it, I wondered why, but now I think I have a pretty good idea.<br /><br />As for the leading performers themselves, well, I had always wondered what it might be like to see Matt Damon and Leonardo di Caprio in a movie together, which actually, was the main reason that I had had any interest in seeing it at all. The former does a pretty good job with his character and at no point in the film does he ever appear as if he was reading off a cue card, or some nonsense like that, even though personally, I liked him better in 'Ocean's Eleven.' As for the latter, he, too, delivers a stellar presentation, especially in the scene where he's getting his already-injured hand smashed, banged up against a table, and then beaten with a shoe. Even Jack Nicholson comes through with a praiseworthy presentation with his character, even though I always thought that 'The Shining' was his landmark role.<br /><br />I definitely can't say that 'The Departed' is any where close to being my favorite movie. In fact, I can't even say that it is close to being in my Top 10, and it is certainly not one that I have any intention of buying anytime soon. On the other hand, I'll probably just rent it as it did have a couple of parts that actually tried to be good or make any sense. One thing that I have found is that a vast majority of viewers almost always fall into one or more of the five categories mentioned in paragrah # 1, so in that sense, it definitely won't have a tough time establishing a fan base who would equate it with some form of high-ranking personal status. To think that this actually won ""Best Picture of 2006"" award is enough to make you wonder just how far filmmakers went to bribe the Academy THIS time. There's been a lot of that going on in the past few years or so. Additionally, the movie can also be found somewhere on IMDb's Top 250 list (Who knows? Maybe I can bribe the staff members of that website to include a movie I like somewhere on that list, too.), for those readers who refuse to come into close contact with any motion picture that is not. However, if you are looking for a film that is not only on IMDb's Top 250 list, but is actually good, then I would suggest either 'The Shawshank Redemption' or either one of the 'Toy Story' movies as good places to start... and perhaps, even finish."
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	excellent viewing recommend watching this movie in blu ray format absolutely stunning especially when hooked up to my home theatre system a must see movie
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"This movie is one of the best movies of all time. Very action oriented with a dark grimy feel to it. This directors cut version includes both the ""regular cut"" and the unrated cut,(which has a few extra scenes)each on thier own seperate BRDVD. Comes packed with extras! One of the extras is a mini video game. You use your Bluray remote to play the game. So fun. By far this is one of the most visually impressive movies ever! No joke. If you are like me and just jumped on the High Def bandwagon, this is THE movie you want to show off your TV's awsomeness! Almost looks 3d. Overall this is a movie worth owning. 10+/10 stars"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This DVD was simply outstanding!!! A true must-see for anyone who likes comedy of any kind!!! I would recommend it to anyone, even my 75-year-old mother, who loved it as well!!!
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	I loved this movie.  Great imagination, well crafted and believable, I find it money well spent for entertainment.  Great service from Amazon.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	If you're looking for a challenging workout that will take your cardio to the next level this workout will do the trick.  I already consider myself in pretty good shape, but I am on my second week and I still need to take breaks during the workout.  The package comes with a description of the program, a calendar to track your progress and all the CDs.  This workout uses no weights and the workouts are under an hour.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is visually extraordinary right from the start. Scenes featuring snow are always more memorable. Maybe its due to its lack of color or the way the snow seems to be falling so rapidly and yet so slowly at the same time, but ""Snow White"" plays this up on more than one occasion. Its $170 million budget is tossed around constantly with nearly every time Ravenna (Charlize Theron) is on screen or when her dark army is struck with something and shatters. The Mirror Man in Ravenna's mirror is also extremely impressive.<br /><br />The cast is extremely solid. Charlize Theron does seem to over do it at times, but is mostly just extremely passionate about her goals, quick tempered, and borderline insane. Chris Hemsworth puts on a pretty decent Scottish accent as The Hunstman isn't a completely different spin on the characters we're used to seeing Hemsworth play, but adds just enough (being a drunk and completely miserable) to make it seem slightly different. The dwarves may be what saves the entire film though. They're both technically useful and provide enough comic relief from the grim tale that's being told to make the film way better than it should be.<br /><br />The big issue though is that ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" feels like it borrows from a lot of movies you already love. The most obvious one being that the movie evolves into feeling like a junior or lite version of ""The Hobbit"" due later this year. The most impressive visual sequence is when the characters enter the dark forest. That entire sequence feels like it's pulled directly out of ""Princess Mononoke."" While Kristen Stewart is more than likely not on everyone's list of favorite actresses, she's actually pretty okay here. It's difficult to argue with only seeing rabbit teeth whenever she's on screen though.<br /><br />The score is a lot like the movie, as well. There are moments of brilliance, but it seems to get overzealous at times and collapses on itself. What's odd is that the movie seems to cater to Bob Hoskins character of Muir. He's always got something to say about the princess and his introduction is stretched out the longest. When Snow White finally heads off to deal with Ravenna, the camera zooms in on Muir just so he can say, ""Farewell, princess!"" It just seemed very bizarre and out of place at times. Bob Hoskins is awesome, but taking the time to hear what Muir had to say so often didn't always fit with what was going on.<br /><br />""Snow White and the Huntsman"" has style dripping from every frame of celluloid and features incredible imagery. The performances are mostly very entertaining, the score is fairly satisfying, and its special effects are just extremely well done and pure bliss for your eyes. The way the movie borrows from so many beloved franchises though and its rather bittersweet ending threw a monkey wrench into the works of fully enjoying of what this could have been. Nevertheless, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" is delightful popcorn entertainment."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I don't know what I could say that hasn't been said already, but this film is positively genius! First rate animation, amazing characters, great voice acting, wonderful plot with morals and lessons to learn, great soundtrack, it's perfect. An all around great family movie that's one of our family favorites!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Product came in 3 days. A hard workout but if you push yourself it will be worth it. I recommend this to anybody that wants to get in to shape.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Tapes are fantastic, we love them,  they were the big hit this Christmas/
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	start a grass root movement to bring the bad practices to a stop. show this movie to any church group and club that you can.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"This was bought to add to my own collection.  I had seen the movie in the theater and found it very intense and riveting adult movie.  I purchased the DVD knowing exactly what I was getting and looking forward to being able to watch the movie again to watch for ""things I missed"" the first time.  I love the extra features about the making of the movie on the DVDs that my husband and I refer to as ""surprises""."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Up to the high quality I would expect from the Harry Potter series.  Highly recommend.  Lots of action.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"PQ 4.5/5, AQ 4/5. Watched on a 42"" and 50"" Plasma and BD35 and LG BH200 BD player.<br /><br />Although I had not watched the show on HBO the 1st time it aired, we watched it on a BD set, as my girlfriend loves vampire-themed shows and books. She had read the Sookie Stackhouse series and enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />The show has very funny, engaging characters, and blends vampire lore with humor extremely well. I was hooked about episode 3, and enjoyed the dialogue and chemistry between the characters.<br /><br />As I am consistently immersed in technology, the step back to a simple time, with ""normal"" people was refreshing and more realistic than other shows on TV. The characters are hysterical, and the script is funny and witty which balances out the grim counter story of the vampire society. Though obvious, the paralells of the perils of discrimination against marginalized groups, is expertly interwoven in the Vampire vs. Human political rights fight, and is one of the most valuable aspects of the show. I highly recommend this show for anyone who loves vampires, or supernatural elements!"
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	I have read all the books and got HBO just to watch the series.  It's kind of disappointing because the books are so much better, but the vampires are great and well cast, especially Eric and Bill.  They are HOT, HOT, HOT! Anna Paquin, as Sookie, is OK, but I think she overacts a good bit. She speaks so emphatically that sometimes she is almost as obnoxious as Tara.<br /><br />As for everyone else, I feel like I just have to wait through their parts (actually I am usually reading another book) to get to the vampires.  Jason is just disgusting and nasty, Sam is creepy and Tara is totally obnoxious.  And these are still my opinions after having watched the first 8 episodes.<br /><br />My family is from a small town about 50 miles from Shreveport. I can guarantee you no one is running barefoot through the cemetery in the middle of the night.  Too many snakes, fireants, grassburs, poison ivy, etc.<br /><br />I don't know anything about Alan Ball, but I think many of the changes he's made are not improvements.  I understand why he needed to make some of the characters' parts, especially Tara's, more important since the books are in the first person and from Sookie's point of view.  But it has almost become an ensemble cast rather than Sookie and the vampires.<br /><br />I want to see more on the vampires and Sookie.  Especially Eric! Just saw him in the tub scene as I'm rewatching episode 8 as I'm typing this. Scorching hot!
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	Harry Potter is definitely not just for children. I am 60 years old and an avid fan since the first book. I very much enjoyed Order of the Phoenix, but it is a shame that it was so truncated.That is why I only gave it a three star rating. It deserves a Michael Jackson director who understands that there is no stinting on the necessary parts of an epic film. Phoenix was so fast moving that if I hadn't read the book 6 times I would have been totally lost.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that they understand that Harry deserves more grounding before they film the last two installments.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	This was a good movie, with plenty of action and entertainment.  It did drag at some parts and somethings didn't make sense....in why the scene was needed.  It served no purpose.  But overall it was a fun movie.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"So here we are at last. Part one of the last film of one of the best series of movies in a very long time. The Harry Potter series, books and movies both, have been generally very good, very well-received and very profitable.<br /><br />Part one of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is very good. In many ways its better than the first half of the book it's based on. It tells the tale... well, you all know what it's about. Harry and friends go hunting down the various parts of Voldemort's soul in order to destroy him. They do this with the support and hindrance of roughly half of the Royal Shakespearean Company.<br /><br />The movie suffers from one of the same problems that the book suffers from, and that's what I describe as ""Harry Potter and the Endless Camping Trip"". There are many, many scenes with the kids out camping and trying to decide what to do next. They angst, they are argue, the waffle and debate. This does not make for the most compelling reading nor the most compelling watching. Frankly the camping scenes could've been trimmed down considerably and we wouldn't have lost much.<br /><br />Aside from that, everything about the movie superb, and I'm very happy Warner Bros chose not to release it in 3-D. There's just no need for it. The movie looks fine without it, and hopefully they will abandon plans to release part two in that format.<br /><br />Whomever it was that cast Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (who looks better and better with each film), Emma Watson and all the other primaries should probably receive a special Oscar for their efforts. They managed to cast the perfect actors for this series, and thanks to that and a great respect for the material we've been treated to a series of films where even the weakest is still pretty damn good. There's not many other film franchises one can say that about."
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	This movie was amazing in my opinion! Don't listen to the critics who aren't qualified to tell us what movies to like and nitpickers, who are never satisfied. I thought the film was visually stunning, had a great story and action packed. Also, more importantly the film did answer some of the lingering questions many of us fans had as to the origins of the creature we know as the Alien, it's purpose and the Engineers. Yes, It did also leave some questions, which are already fueling interesting theories online, but that's also part of the magic of story writing for such a well known and loved franchise. The director Ridley Scott said that he's already planning a sequel, so will most likely we'll have to wait in anticipation for some of those questions to get answered, but that's o.k. in my opinion. Well done Ridley Scott and Damon L.! This is a must see for Alien fans and Sci-Fi fans.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I have been watching the tv show since it started and fell in love immediately. (It's so hot!) Even my history channel-watching boyfriend loves it!  When Season 2 started, I'd thought I would start reading the book series(after being so disappointed with Twilight). I am now on Book 7 and have to say that while the books vary greatly from the tv show, it made not an ounce of difference. I am enjoying both separately (although sometimes I mix up story lines from the books to the tv show).<br />If you are expecting to see the tv show ripped from the book series, don't even bother watching. But you'll be missing the best show on tv since the Sopranos and SATC.
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	As a big fan of the Indiana Jones movies, I was excited to see this one, but it disappointed greatly.  In fact, it does not even seem like a Steven Spielberg movie at all.  Not exciting, and none of the non-stop action of earlier movies.  Moreover, the characters were not engaging, with the possible exception of Shia LaBoeuf, who was as engaging as possible for the part he had.  The talented Cate Blanchett should have said no to the ridiculous part they gave her, which was reminiscent of Boris and Natasha from Rocky & Bullwinkle.  I didn't care about Karen Allen's character, and Indy just looked tired.  The plot was drivel.  Aliens?  Puh-lease!  The only thing that earned this movie two stars was the gorgeous visual impact.  The costumes and sets were lush and authentic-looking for their era.  It was a beautiful visual treat.  Aside from that, I really didn't care for or about this movie at all.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B000S5KGH4	1.0	b	If you enjoy lunchtime revues in Vegas, then this is the show for you. If you enjoy humor from within the past 3 decades... then stay away!!!!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Once again we watched cars with the grand kids, love the movie, the moral content is top notch and it is always clean.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"Never ever leave your partner behind, is a resounding theme that should be kept and explored throughout life.  It is also explored heavily in the movie, ""Fireproof.""  All too often we easily decide that we made a mistake in doing something and want to take the easy way out.  This movie is definitely for those folks who are not willing to run from any fight.  It is for those who are contemplating marriage or who may already be in a marital relationship.<br /><br />With Kirk Cameron (Growing Pains) leading the charge as the hot-tempered Fire Captain Caleb Holt, this movie I believe will definitely be a hit for years to come.  Caleb is the type of firefighter who loves to be in the limelight with his hero status among the community and his men.  His wife Catherine (Erin Bethea) is the type of co-star that definitely accents the marital troubles they are facing.  At one point Catherine decides that she has had enough of Caleb and asks for the divorce he is seeking.  His father puts him to the test with a ""forty day love dare,"" so that he can learn that marriage isn't always about his needs.  There is someone else that fits into the equation and you don't want to leave her behind."
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Indy IV looks to be like a fun ride. My dad took me when I was 12 to see Raiders and now I get to take my 12-year-old son. This may be a late encore but a guilty pleasure for everyone. Go, enjoy and be a kid again!<br /><br />Georgia Jones
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	Great Movie.  I am an adult, and it's been years since I have watched a CGI movie but my girlfriend and I both loved this one!! We picked it up because we both love cars, but ended up loving it for it's high quality story and well-developed characters.  It's definitely a feel good, family movie, but it has a lot to offer, especially for a car enthusiast.<br /><br />The only reason we gave it 4 stars is because it forces you to buy a DVD combo if you want the blu-ray.  This seems excessive to me, and certainly a waste of a DVD.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"""Prometheus"" is an ambitious movie -- it wants to answer (in a sci-fi way) the questions that have haunted humanity for eons.<br /><br />And... it doesn't. This sorta-kinda-maybe prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise raises a lot of scientific/philosophical questions and never really answers them. But if you can bypass that, it's still a very solid, harrowing sci-fi adventure, with some powerful lead performances and truly brilliant direction by Ridley Scott.<br /><br />Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her partner Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient star maps that may lead to the Engineers, aliens responsible for making the human race. So with the funding of elderly bazillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), they set out to a remote moon on board the Prometheus.<br /><br />Upon landing, the crew finds a vast torc-shaped spaceship, filled with the dead bodies of Engineers. But there is also a bizarre black liquid that ravages anyone who is exposed to it -- and leaves Shaw threatened by a bizarre alien life form. As she discovers the ugly true reason behind the expedition, she also finds that the Engineers are not what she expected...<br /><br />""Prometheus"" can be kind of frustrating -- it has a lot of unanswered questions and dangling plot threads, and eventually it makes you feel like it's the first half of a two-part story. And there's a lot of scientific/philosophical/religious stuff that is lightly touched on, but isn't really handled in an insightful way (although it was nice to see a scientist who is also religious).<br /><br />But despite those flaws.... ""Prometheus"" is actually a really enjoyable movie. There's a lot of passion and earnest intensity to this movie, and it was clearly made with a lot of love.<br /><br />And Ridley Scott's direction is absolutely brilliant -- he interweaves slimy tentacled horror with sleek, shadowy sci-fi, until they are indistinguishable from each other. Everything grows more intense as the black liquid starts mutating the crew members, until the climax explodes into a chaos. Things just spiral more and more out of control, and you never quite know what's going to happen.<br /><br />You also wouldn't recognize Rapace as the girl with the dragon tattoo here -- she's elfin and luminous, with enormous expressive eyes and a mop of rumpled hair. She handles the role of Shaw beautifully -- a person who is deeply religious but also devoted to science, extremely intellectual but also very strong (particular in the... um, medical procedure scene).<br /><br />She's also flanked by awesome performances by the icy, rigid Charlize Theron and the pleasant, charming Idris Elba. But the scene-stealer is Fassbender, who plays a charming, elegant android who occasionally shows some flickers of human emotion. At times he seems soulless and cold, but then we see him watching his favorite movie or asking questions about faith.<br /><br />""Prometheus"" is a riveting sci-fi story, albeit a flawed one that never answers most of our questions. Here's hoping ""Prometheus 2"" is a bit more satisfying."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Love Jeff.  You forget that he is talking with a puppet.  Watched it over and over.  Even sent a copy to all family members.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"Prometheus stands well above the vast majority of sci-fi/horror films. Visually stunning (the first film i have ever seen that i didnt HATE the cgi...no hyperbole). Unlike some of the other opinions ive read, I thoroughly enjoyed the existential foundation of Prometheus. Questions were posed and, for the most part, answered (within reason...some of the questions were never meant to be answered). I feel like Prometheus really needs another film or two to fully flesh out the intriguing groundwork that it began (and to further tie into the alien canon/biology etc.). Though maybe not a ""prequel"" in the traditional sense, prometheus definitely resides within the confines of the fictional world that was constructed in alien, aliens, and alien 3 (yes, i left out the travesty known as alien ""insurrection""). The biggest questions I have concern the various forms of alien biology explored in the film. Id really like to see the biological progression moved forward and explained a bit more in future films. anyways...enjoyed the movie. I particularly enjoyed the many strands of subtext runnning through prometheus. I plan on buying the blu -ray (2D forever!) Try not to let all of the hype and history blow things out of proportion for you. Just do your homework and appreciate the film for what it is. Awaiting the next installment..."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I've been enjoying reviewing American history in a well acted series about John Adams.  I haven't read the book but feel the HBO series well depicts the history of a man who was an intregal part of the fight for freedom and independence.  It helped me understand how things transpired during that historical time.  It's incredible what they had to do to make this the free country we now enjoy.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"I'm usually not impressed with most ventriloquists, but Jeff Dunham is the exception. His comedy is top notch and after watching the DVD extras, I can say that he can even deal with ""wardrobe malfunctions"" better than most pop singers."
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	The first several episodes were excellent, but then someone who puts this show together thought it would good to include a subplot about Tara and her alcoholic mother.  Unfortunately, WAY too much time is spent on this. This is a show about vampires, and the first season is about several murders.  So why does Tara and messed up mom get 20 - 25% of airtime? It makes no sense. Even if this is somehow important to the second season, they could have shortened it.  Other annoying aspects of this season are the juvenile relationships between Sookie and her suitors and the very stereotyped characters.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	Brainless story and wooden acting from all except Charlize Theron. You all know the classic story's foundation. This movie asks us to believe that Kristen Stewart is the prettiest in the land?? I don't know about you, but I was routing for the huntsman to kill her even before he actually came on to the screen. The girl simply...cannot...act. The Twilight movies should have given that impression loud and clear, and although I had some hope b/c there actually are good actors (Theron/Bob Hoskins/Ian MacShane), this movie flat out stunk.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	I think some people who are true sci-fi fans and either didn't like this movie initially or were confused on how to feel about it should watch it again.<br /><br />I watched this the first nite it came out in theatres and everyone was super quiet after the movie ended. I think everyone was processing...This movie doesn't use the typical sci fi tactics to engage the audience... there isn't really a constant feed of mind-numbing visual action one would assume. This movie was done tastefully (for the most part) and speaking of good taste...wow, there is a really freaking hot guy in this. Logan Marshall-Green is so friggin' hawwwwwwt he made me smile just watching him. But prepare thyself because there is a price to pay for those good looks of his. I will not spoil anything but if you're squirmish, get ready!. .<br /><br />Initially it was hard for me to accept Noomi as the female protagonist for a few reasons. I'll just come out and say it: there is something off-putting about her facial structure and hair for me. Her bone structure is maybe just bad on film. I wanted to slick her hair back the whole movie because it was always in her face. Not to mention her accent in this. In the end, she won me over with her perseverance for answers despite the obstacles and her ability to survive. I can't say I'm sold on the idea that she would have pushed through all she did due to how her character was presented, but I accepted it and kept my eye on the idea her character brought up which is you may not like what answers you find that reside beyond your faith but the truth is freeing. She really is a pretty good actress so eventually my shallow reasons for not liking her fell by the wayside.<br /><br />I love the guy who plays the captain of the Prometheus- Idris Elba. He has a few cheesy lines, but I think he was good for the role. And ya gotta have the black guy! Charlize Theron is, as usual, wonderful to watch. Fassbender was pretty good but I never got why he was such a vindictive android plus I had just recently seen him in Shame and the transition from a sex crazed sad guy to android was a little (*cough*) hard to shake. Guy Pearce was okay at best being a gross old rich man; I wish they would have just used an old man though. Older actors need roles and this would have fit the bill for the right old man. And I REALLY wish they would have better visualized the ship itself since the movie was even named after it. I never got a good sense of the layout. One of the things I didn't like about this movie.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT! The aliens in the movie are well done. I got so frustrated when the alien doesn't answer Dr. Shaw in some way after she pleads for answers and pours her heart out. In his facial expression, the alien seems moved by her briefly, but then the android steps in and just pisses him off. You'd think Mr. Weyland would have a better plan for first contact than to use an android as ambassador asking for sh1t. That is not how you get what you want. No less from an HR Giger represented alien species.<br /><br />Despite the stereotypical plot twists and tactics, I really enjoyed this film. I wish there were more sci-fi movies in general and I've always been a fan of Aliens (and I'm not too big on scary stuffz). Don't expect perfection from it, despite my 5 star rating. Compared to all the thoughtless garbage Hollywood makes these days, this is a gem... You might just need to give it a second (or third) chance to let it charm you.
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	The dvd was wonderful, full of the comedy I've come to expect from Jeff.The only place I found fault was in a couple of the special features, they just were not my taste in comedy. So to anyone thinking of getting this dvd, please do so, its wonderful.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"Young biker Mutt Williams (to Indiana Jones): ""So, what are you, like 80?""<br /><br />Some SPOILERS in this.<br /><br />See Indy battle the KGB!! Thrill to his sidekick's simian exploits!! Witness Chris Carter calling his lawyer!!<br /><br />Trying to be fair. Trying to be fair. But I guess I'm sipping a bit from a bottle of hater-ade right now. Firstly, by no means is this a terrible film, not with Spielberg at the helm. Any other picture, and I may even think it a four star film. But the Indiana Jones franchise should be held to a much higher standard. Only, I guess George Lucas wasn't satisfied with mucking up the Star Wars universe. Dude looked around, gazed at his belly button, and then arrived at the big epiphany: ""Hey! Indiana Jones and space aliens!!"" Spielberg and Ford should've flung him off a cliffhanger. INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL just goes to prove that it's better to strike when the iron's hot. Did it really take this long to come up with a working storyline? And then this is the best that could be worked out? I am hugely bumming right now. This fourth entry effectively takes away from the luster of the Indiana Jones franchise. STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE and STAR TREK V: THE FINAL FRONTIER are snickering at THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL. They might even be pointing fingers.<br /><br />It's been 19 years since INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE. With Harrison Ford now in his mid-60s, it's unrealistic that the film would have him still gallivanting in the World War II era, fighting Nazis. Truth is, I was actually looking forward to seeing our favorite archaeologist in a 1950s backdrop, which is more age-appropriate to him. The film touches on that decade's nervous tropes - the McCarthy paranoia, the fear of the atom bomb, the Cold War... And for villains, Indy gets the KGB, which is a fine institution for nefariousness, except that these guys aren't as classic or as contemptible as the Nazis; so, right there, something is diminished. On the other hand, the film does capture that vintage 1950s look. There's a fun scene in which Indy instigates a rumble at a vintage diner (to the tune of ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"") and then motors thru the college campus.<br /><br />It was George Lucas who came up with introducing a 1950s sci-fi B-movie element into the storyline, even though you can tell in the bonus features that Spielberg wasn't too enthused about it. But, moving on, there's always a fun pulp adventure element in the Find-the-Relic game in which Indy so often finds himself playing. The McGuffin here happens to be an ancient crystal skull, the return of which artifact to the fabled city of Akator (a.k.a. El Dorado) will, if the legends are true, grant unimaginable power to its bearer. So it's another race against time around the globe, with Indy this time going up against the psychic female KGB agent, Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, who is having fun).<br /><br />It sucks that Sean Connery insisted on staying retired, rather than reprising his role as Indy's dad. But at least Karen Black returns as the always feisty Marion Ravenwood, so there's still something of the familiar in this new continuity. Decades later, Marion and Indy still have unresolved issues. Shia Labeouf enters the franchise as the scowling, leather jacket sporting, hair-greased-back biker Mutt Williams -and I didn't like him much. There's a revelation about him later on which fails to stun anyone. Ray Winstone is here, as well, as Indy's untrustworthy ally, and John Hurt also, as a demented professor.<br /><br />Harrison Ford, despite the creakiness, only lets up a little with the action sequences, and reportedly, he performed a fair bit of his own stunts. Even in his dotage, Indy can still take infinite amounts of punishment. There's still very much a sense of those 1930s cliffhanger serials in this film. The movie starts out with a nifty set piece in a musty, gigantic military warehouse in Nevada, with Indy held at gunpoint and instructed to seek out a stowed-away relic. Longtime fans will recognize this warehouse, of course, and there's even a fond nod to the Ark. It's pretty cool, also, the clever manner in which Indy tracks down that relic. And when the guns start blazing, Indy demonstrates that he's still pretty spry for a sexagenarian, knocking heads and swinging thru the air with his trusty bullwhip. This extended sequence culminates with Indy silhoutted against a nuclear mushroom cloud. A pretty cool image.<br /><br />I used to think that THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL was a dumb title, until I heard the other ones being passed around (INDIANA JONES AND THE SAUCER MEN and INDIANA JONES AND THE ATTACK OF THE GIANT ANTS). One writer for the film, joking around, actually came out with my favorite, INDIANA JONES AND THE SON OF INDIANA JONES. Ah, well. There's bits of humor scattered throughout, including a very funny revisiting of Indy's ophiophobia. The action sequences are predictably dynamite stuff, with plenty of cliffhanger moments, that is, until they're undermined by a dose of silly buggers. One such is introduced in the elaborate Jungle Chase Which Takes Forever, which features Mutt precariously dueling with the KGB villainess on speeding vehicles and then swinging vine to vine with CG-created monkeys, at which point I threw up my own imaginary fedora in disgust. Also offputting is the tonal shift from occult in past films to sci-fi in this one. So, just when I thought I was done nitpicking, not only is the climax somewhat reminiscent of NATIONAL TREASURE 2, but its trite X-Files overtones has the film officially jumping the shark for me. George Lucas tried to hedge it, stating that, nuh-uh, these creatures weren't at all extraterrestrials, but, rather, interdimensional beings... who just happened to look like aliens. Ooookay.<br /><br />Two discs in this package. Disc one has the feature film, as well as two special features: ""The Return of A Legend"" (17 minutes long) and a pre-production segment (12 minutes). On Disc 2: an in-depth six-chaptered Production Diary (around 79 minutes, and you get your money's worth); ""Warrior Makeup"" - a segment about the extensive makeup process for the keloid-decorated jungle warriors and the mud warriors (5 minutes); the legend of ""The Crystal Skulls"" is explored and also how the production crew manufactures their likeness (10 minutes); ""Iconic Props"" - concerning the props used in the film (10 minutes); ""The Effects of Indy"" covers the CG f/x and the model work done, including the desert test town that gets blown up (22 minutes); ""Adventures in Post-Production"" covers Ben Burtt's sound design and John William's scoring of the film (12 minutes); ""Closing: Team Indy"" is a shout-out to the film crew's principals (3 minutes); Pre-Visualization Sequences - pre-vis is a rough animated storytelling device which, in this case, preps the crew for 3 action sequences (the Area 51 get-away, the jungle chase, and the ant attack; totalling 14 minutes); 5 galleries and 2 trailers; and a game demo of LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, XBOX 360.<br /><br />There's a sense of trying too hard in this picture. I got the sense also that it was trying really hard to sell Mutt Williams to the audience, to the point where I felt threatened for the Indy character. So, while I'm so glad to see Indy still very much doing his thing, this movie leaves me feeling robbed. It's good that John Williams' theme song is along to make things feel more canon. I, for one, wouldn't mind another Indiana Jones film, if only so that Indy could bow out on a higher note. Harrison Ford may be past his prime as an action hero but, for his age, he still carries himself well, so another adventure is still do-able. But if Ford wants to retire Indy, then I hope the movie studio isn't contemplating plonking a fedora on Shia LaBoeuf's noggin and handing him a bullwhip. Because there will be an uprising."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	This review has nothing to do with the movie, you knkow it's great.  I bought the 3 pack because I can watch the Blu-Ray disc at home with the kids, the regular disc goes in the car for long drives and the digital download goes on my iPad for my business trips.  3 different ways to enjoy the best movie of 2010. BTW it was a good price and the shipping was reasonable too.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I saw this on HBO when it first aired and absolutely loved it. I put it on my wish list as a dvd set that I hope to own soon. I would highly recommend it, not only for it's fabulous acting, but for its historic value.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie was wonderful to just watch and enjoy. It also has amazing values in the whole story line. Anyone at any age will enjoy this movie. Children and and person that loves cars will definately love it. My family had fun finding all of the 'hidden' cars parts in the scenery. Once you start finding them, you can't stop finding more. The animation was unbelievable. The characters were wonderful and delightful. I just cannot say anything bad about this movie.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"This documentary is very well put-together.  Similar to ""King Corn"" (2007), however it is exceeding in superior content, logical flow and screen-play.  I enjoyed it thoroughly."
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	"This DVD was so funny I bought copies for my (grown) kids.<br /><br />Now they all go around saying ""On a stick"" after anyone introduces them."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	My nephew and I love this movie it follows the book better then any Harry Potter film yet!  It sets the stage for the last film- I cannot wait!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Only wish this came in 3D.  Really great Blu-ray/DVD.  Gave it to my grandson and it was almost impossible to pry him away from watching it.  Never say anyone want to watch a DVD over and over again.  Made my heart feel great.  Anyway, great DVD.  Looking forward to getting the 3Blu-Ray version when it comes out.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	Considering that I usually like scifi movies, Ridley Scott and the Alien series, Prometheus is some particular nonsense. Lousy plot, mediocre acting and virtually nothing to do with the original Alien movies, even though they claim to be the prequel. Sorry to say, but in general: highly disappointing.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	our family loves this movie! I was so happy when my daughter asked for a copy for Christmas. This item was a great price, fast shipping, and arrived in excellent condition!
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	"Charlize Theron was awesome as the evil queen.  Gave me chills each time she was in a scene.  You could almost feel the evil oozing out of her.  Still, her character could have been better with 2 things.<br />Chris Hemsworth as the drunken, washed-up huntsman was also believable.  Still we could have had a bit more back-story to show us about losing his wife and why he turned drunken and washed-up.<br />Kristen Stewart...enough said about her already and I agree with all the negative reviews of her performance.<br />The 3 things needed to improve this film?<br />1. Get a better actress to play Snow White.  You know, someone who can actually act instead of someone who looks like a constipated person trying to have a bowel movement.  Someone who can deliver a rallying speech that is actually coherent and makes you feel motivated.  No, I'm not a Kristen Stewart hater.  In fact, I've seen her in a couple of movies where she was very good.  Of course, that was before she became a ""star"" and was when she was playing a supporting role.  She was a very good actress in those movies.<br />2. Get better writers.  Again, the rallying speech.  I had to back up and listen to it again.  Yep, it's still random words strung together that make little or no sense.  And the evil queen could have been so much better if she'd had REAL dialog to work with.  Heck, every character could have been epic with proper dialog and a less strung-out story.  The story scattered after Snow White escapes.  Who are the scarred women?  How did they manage to build their village and survive?  Who knows, because the writers obviously didn't think we would need to know mundane things like that.  And what was up with the troll scene?  Where exactly does this fit into the story?  Because it certainly didn't go anywhere or add to the movie in any way.<br />3. Get a better director.  And once again with the rallying speech.  Can someone honestly say the director saw that scene and said, ""Yes, that's what I want!""  Because if he actually thought that was great acting, he needs to get a new job.  Maybe as a dog-walker.  I normally don't pay attention to directing.  Then again, I've never seen anything this badly directed before.  There was no consistency in this movie.  One scene would be delivered with breath-taking beauty and spell-binding acting and the next would come up like a club and smack you in the head with it's wooden-ness.  As I said, if the director looked at his finished product and felt proud, he really needs to get another job.<br />All in all, I don't feel I wasted my money buying the movie.  The few good points are so spectacular they make up for the glaringly bad points."
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I really enjoyed this imaginative remake of the children's classic. The seven dwarfs were not the guys I remember as a child.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	"HBO took the low road.<br /><br />I am on book four of the Sookie Stackhouse series.  I hadn't seen the series and bought season one to get a visual on the characters.  For the most part I liked Sookie, Bill and Sam.  I knew it was HBO with vampires and I clearly wasn't expecting ""Father Knows Best"".  My complaint is the far too excessive profanity and the bad taste softporn.<br />What could have been an excellent opportunity to build on Charlane Harris' books just once again showed Hollywood's poor judgment. By episode three or four I was fastforwarding through scenes.  Toward the end of the series it was being somewhat toned down compared to the beginning. Disappointed with the writing not Anna Paquin, Stephen Moyer and Sam Trammell,"
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is on my list for best movies of all time! I love it. He was an extraordinary man and the movie was clean and so well made. The details were wonderful. It was like watching an adult rated G movie, b.c. of the lack of filth so many other movies have today, yet it was still so suspensful and engaging! If I could give it higher than 5 stars I would and I am not usually drawn into political history, but this movie made it so interesting. Well worth the money. Enjoy!
B00447G29S	3.0	b	I bought the Blu Ray edition b/c my 3 year old wore out the standard DVD edition. It got so used I could recite most of the lines in the movie, so I thought the Blu Ray edition might POP on my 1080P set. I really couldn't tell the difference really in video quality. The audio was equal also since I played both on my 7.1 sound system. My advice, stick with the standard DVD and save yourself some cash so you can buy something like Inception that will make your eyes pop and is a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because the movie storyline is quite excellent and my boys watch it year round. If the video or audio quality was better, it would have been a 4 star. Very few things in my book get a 5 star rating.
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	This is one of the worst movies we've seen. The cinema is great, the plot great and the ending sort of about what one would expect a 13 year-old to write after a night sniffing glue and staying up. We literally threw the movie in the trash when we were done.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"This isn't for the faint of heart.  You need an exercise area, sneakers, water and a big towel because this workout will make you sweat.<br /><br />I would consider myself ""in shape"".  My gym closed down for 3 months for renovations and I do have a personal trainer.  But my wife and I needed some cardio because it's getting to cold to run outside.  So decided to get Insanity.<br /><br />We previewed the DVD and bought some workout mats that were thick enough not to damage our joints and move out all the boxes in the basement to clear enough space for the workout also.  During the first ""fit test"", I nearly lost vomited.  Dripping in sweat and drinking almost half a gallon of water.  My wife (who is in better shape than I am) was whining in pain.<br /><br />I'm on day 4 now and days 1-3 were tough.  Neither of us can walk without something hurting and stairs are tough. LOL.  I'm in pain as I type this review!  It is worth it, you need to be dedicated and have about 45 mins/day.  I'm looking forward to the second fit test in 10 days!"
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"""The Departed"" is an excellent cop thriller revolving around Boston crime lord Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and his inside man, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), who is embedded within the police force. Sullivan gives the impression of heading up the Costello investigation, when in reality he's secretly feeding Frank enough information to keep his buddy one step ahead of the police. Meanwhile, disgraced police cadet William Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is pressured into going undercover as one of Costello's newest soldiers. Costigan attempts to help the police bring down Costello and identify the leak within the Boston P.D.<br /><br />This film is fast-paced and very exciting throughout. There are many multiple subplots that involve Sullivan and Costigan searching for each other and simultaneously romancing the same woman (Vera Farmiga). The film also contains excellent supporting roles played by Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg, who deliver powerful (and at times hilarious) performances. ""The Departed"" never loses momentum, and it's full of surprising twists and turns right up until the final scene. The cast is excellent and everyone delivers outstanding performances. I think the only gripe I have about the movie is that Damon's Boston accent tends to fade in and out from scene to scene, which becomes pretty annoying after a while. Still, it was great to see Damon play a slimy character for once, and watching Damon, DiCaprio and Nicholson interact onscreen was wonderful: They're all excellent actors, and every scene was fabulous.<br /><br />I'll probably purchase ""The Departed"" on DVD, as it's one of those movies I'll be able to enjoy again and again. It is also quite possibly the best cop movie ever. I'm so glad that Martin Scorsese won an Oscar for it."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This video was first viewed at my brother in law's home.<br /><br />Mark, said it was very funny.  What an understatement.  I had no idea.<br /><br />Before the end of the video the laughter was such that I was gasping<br /><br />for air and clutching my sides. When we got home  I ordered ten copies<br /><br />and gave them away to our closest friends as Christmas<br /><br />presents.  What a hit. If you want to give the gift of laughter,<br /><br />then this video  is the ticket!  You can't go wrong.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	It wasn't nearly as good as i heard it was. I was rather disappointed in the movie over all just didn't have the impact that the trailers made me think there would be.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Prometheus.. A smart film that revives the series of Alien, Ridley Scott returns to their old tricks in this masterpiece, very well prepared and very well developed .. I'm waiting for DVD, BluRay 3D, Bluray and digital copy for my collection, I can't wait....
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"This movie had so much hype and looked like it should be a great movie! I can't believe I sat through the whole thing! I just kept telling myself ""oh it will get better this is just the boring begining."" But it just never happened and I now lost 2 hours of my life that I would have rather spent in prison.<br />This is one of those artsy fartsy movies that is so bad that people think it is good. There is no soundtrack at all and most of the time your TV will be silent except for the wind or gravel crunch of someone's shoe as you watch them walk for 5 mins towards a deer.<br />So if you like mild action scenes mixed with a lot of conversations that have absolutly nothing to do with what is going on with the movie, than this is the summer lackluster for you!"
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	"I'll open Pandora's box on this and risk the raves of outraged fans.<br /><br />Anyway ....<br /><br />There are those of us who have not read all of the books in the set and therefore depend on the film to convey what is going on in Harry Potter's world. While I enjoyed the movie for it's whimsical content and some very well done scenes/characterizations, I find this particular installment to be rather diffuse and confusing (no, I have not read the book - didn't realize that was a prerequisite).<br /><br />Scenes just kinda pop up with no real rhyme or reason as to why they are there. I am sure the written work explains everything, but the movie should stand-alone and not rely on its audience having read the author's work. I can understand the need to cut from a book to preclude a film that might easily be over four hours long, but then the cuts have to be very selective and intelligently done.<br /><br />Couple examples: Why the opening scenes with Dudley and why are the dementors attacking Harry? Were they sent by the Ministry? By Voldemort? Why is the Ministry taking extremes in this case with Harry using magic outside of school? He has done so before with the Ministry just shrugging their shoulders (""The Ministry of Magic does not send one to Azkaban for blowing up their Aunt"", from Prisoner).<br /><br />Why is Minister Fudge concerned with Dumbledore vying for his job? Nothing was hinted at this in earlier films, nor was it addressed in the beginning of this film. Why would the Minister deny the return of Voldemort as a tool to use against Dumbledore? This makes no sense for a politician and turns out to work against him. Seems like the Minister Fudge has suddenly taken a dislike to Harry and those who support him. Was this V's work?<br /><br />More development was needed on Prof. Snape's encounters with Harry's father while a student himself. While explaining some of Snape's attitude towards Harry in earlier films, it is too shallow. Ditto for L. Malfoy's encounter with Harry in the Hall of Mysteries. We learned in Goblet that he was a Death Eater and follower of Voldemort, but too little was detailed on his role here.<br /><br />And the list goes on. Certainly more film time could have been allocated for this movie to make it more coherent. After all, this is not a test of the market place. Harry Potter films have proven themselves (Phoenix grossed 44.2 million on its opening day in the US) and a larger investment (by the producer) will certainly be returned as the film is released. I felt like I was watching the `Cliff Notes' version of the story when I viewed this episode.<br /><br />Character studies, which have always been a strong point in the series, were mostly lacking here. A notable exception was Delores Umbridge who was deliciously detestable and sufficiently developed to give a `feel' for the character.<br /><br /> Madeye Moody, Lupus and others had cameo appearances. Would have loved to see why they were there. All were part of the original Order of the Phoenix, but again, this was not explained but briefly. Harry Potter's group of students was called ""Dumbledore's Army"" and not ""Order of the Phoenix"" so why the title of the film?<br /><br />I have always enjoyed openings with the Dursley's. They set the theme of a social outcast for Harry, hence his strong ties to Hogwarts and the world of magic where he is not only accepted but acclaimed. These have always had some development or pertinance to the main story, though.<br /><br />In ""Sorcerer's Stone"" we are introduced to Harry's adopted family and shown how he is treated. It is a lead-in to the rest of the film and is well done. In ""Chamber"" we see progress. Although still badly treated, Harry is moved from the cupboard to Dudley's spare bedroom. And while it is not plainly stated, Vernon and company now have a grudging respect/fear of Harry's abilities and friends. In ""Prisoner"" the Dursley family is extended to include a visit from the Aunt -- who turns out to be every bit as petty and hateful as the base family. A bit of comic relief when Harry becomes annoyed with her and 'blows her up'. We can also see the fear Vernan and Petunia have of Harry (Dudley is too stupid and just keeps eating in front of the television) as Marge insults Harry's mother and father, and the lights begin to flicker/wind blow. They know something is coming. Here, Harry has also had enough and moves out of the house in a snit.<br />""Goblet"" has no sequence with the Dursley's, so we assume that Harry has moved in with his Godfather, Sirius. (Hadn't read the book so I don't know if the Dursleys are there or not).<br />In ""Phoenix"", Harry is back with the Dursleys. We don't know why. Interaction between Harry and the family is minimal other than Harry's rescue of Dudley and Uncle Vernan's gleeful announcement of 'Justice' when the message arrives from the Ministry about Harry's expulsion from school. This scene really needed more development in 'Phoenix'. It's like the director put it in just to move us to the scenes at the Ministry of Magic.<br /><br />Short of it all is that this installment was a disappointment to me in that I do not feel it measures up to the previous chapters. Too much was cut from the novel. This seems to have disappointed those who read the book, and for those of us who did not, it left us in the dark about a lot of events and scenes. And while some editing is necessary to keep the film from being too long, the cut sequences should not detract from the pace of the movie or introduce ambiguity. In OOTP they do exactly that.<br /><br />Yes, I would recommend this film as part of the ongoing saga, but not as a stand-alone. For someone just getting started with the Potter series, this is not the one to see.<br /><br />Luke-warm addition to an otherwise outstanding series.<br /><br />Grudgingly Recommended.<br /><br />~P~"
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Sin City is one of my favorite movies. I looks and sounds good on DVD and even better on Blu-ray.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This is a great techno action movie.  Watch it twice so you can pick up any piece you might have missed the first time.  Very intertaining, and from the movies our next technology come!
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	This guy has to be one of the best ventriloquists, and his ad libs with the audience prove he's a real talent.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	This a dark turn even from original Snow White plots. Which I'm ok with but it was more graphic than I thought. Definitely for the more mature of 13 or older. I won't spoil anything else about this movie. Good actors. Dwarfs aren't really dwarf actors. Give the parts to the ones who fit the part
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	This movie answered some questions but left me asking just as many that got answered. I liked this movie alot and it is definitely one that you should not be without. There will be a second movie to tie this in with the alien franchise. Well, there should be. Dont be left in the cold, if you are an alien fan, then you need to watch this movie.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	As usual, Jeff & Crew are great. My wife and I were introduced to Jeff about 20 years ago, and have made multiple trips to see him LIVE at the Improv in DC & Baltimore Md., spending at least $150 per night. This DVD is the best thing you could spend $$$$$ on. I would buy this DVD even if the price was $75, so I could share the experence with all my friends and family. I am creating a Christmas list of at least 10 of these DVD's. I would rate this DVD as a 10 if possible.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	THIS MOVIE  IS OUTSTANDING AND HYSTERICAL..THIS GUY IS SO ENTERTAINING AND VERY CREATIVE COMEDIAN....IVE  WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AND BOUGHT IT  FOR GIFTS FOR FRIENDS.  I LAUGH  OVER  AND OVER  EVERY TIME I WATCH THIS MOVIE .  ITS THE BEST
B00447G29S	5.0	b	My favorite Christmas Movies are:<br />1) It's a Wonderful Life<br />2) A Christmas Story<br />3) The Polar Express
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"Probably because I live under a rock, I wasn't aware that this was supposed to be a prequel of sorts to the Alien series. Judging from previews and this being a ""Ridley Scott film,"" I watched this movie with some hope that it would be a slightly artistic sci-fi offering.  Mostly, this is true. The film progresses very promisingly in the first half, with the haunting, intriguing set piece of an Engineer destroying himself to scatter his DNA, a 2001-like solo turn from Michael Fassbender as a puzzling, brooding android strolling around his futuristic ship, and finally an exciting set-up with a team of geologists, scientists, and archaeologists on the verge of investigating the outpost planet of an alien race that has supposedly created humankind.  After the inevitable plot thickening of the mission suddenly being revealed to be clouded with corporate or perhaps darker personal interests from the CEO figure Weyland, the scientists get into sleek spacesuits with egg-shaped helmets and investigate the outpost structure.  All this is done very well, but soon the movie starts to suffer from its provenance:  Alien was essentially an artsy horror flick on a spaceship, and Prometheus shows elements of that as the scientists start to die off in various outlandish ways.  As other reviewers have noted, the people on this ship behave much more childishly and quite simply MEANLY than anyone hired to engage in interstellar space travel would.<br /><br />Prometheus has some beautiful scenes, an advanced artistic vision in places, and is quite effective at its gross-out moments.  But I felt as though the film wanted it at least three different ways:  classy sci-fi, suspense and horror scares, and philosophical enquiry all rolled into one big-budget behemoth.  Sometimes it's incredibly puerile, which is a shame considering the thought and range of its special effects and untapped acting talent.  But I guess when you come from face-huggers, anything beyond that is progress!!"
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I never jumped on the Harry Potter bandwagon when it first came out. I just recently watched all the movies. All I can say is....wow! They are phenomenal!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"There are several things I really liked about this movie. First off, it really puts you in Boston. I like movies that don't seem generic in time and place. This movie places you in Boston. Scorsese's attention to detail pays off here. I liked the various dialects. I liked the fact that some of the guys were right off the boat from Ireland. That seems realistic. The screenplay is amazing. I can imagine cops talking just like that. The screenplay is VERY realistic in terms of not shying away from using ""bad language"" (someone counted and said that the F-word is used 250 + times in the movie). The mixing of scene and music was great. The themes of the movie: identity, class in America, personal secrecy vs. openness, etc. were well delineated. There was the classic Scorsese humor. We are watching some pretty nasty stuff, and still can laugh at it. It seems to me that this is one of Scorsese's main themes: life is violent and brutal, but still, we can laugh at it. The depiction of the many layers of bureaucracy and secrecy within both police units, and crime organizations, was good. I liked Jack Nicholson, but there were two scenes where they let him go a bit overboard, and he almost *hijacks* the movie in those two scenes. But still, he is great in it. DiCaprio is really good, expressing the multitude of emotions of someone who doesn't know who to trust, or even what his own identity should be. I liked the depiction of psychology, especially as related to police work (""cops see policemen on TV crying after using their gun, and then they think they have to do that too""). I think this movie is saturated with realism. As they say, ""reality is weirder than fiction"". This movie is both sad and funny, all at once. I can't say this is a masterpiece. But it is a very good movie."
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	This ventrilaquist has a unique act. He's not as good at his ventriliquism as say Terry Fadder but I think his act is much funnier. The vidio can be watched with beeps or swearing, either way there's not alot of swearing. His characters can be real or fictional with alot of different senarios. I'm looking to buy another of his vidios.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie is the best! My son Dogan is obsessed and we watch it every night. It never gets old, it has a good storyline and great graphics and cute characters.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	the film left alot for the viewer's imaginiation  as I know the real story of the snow white saga. the plot was hard to grasp as the wicked step mother did not live up to the origional ....
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Great movie not only for kids but Adults! Gave away as Christmas prsents. Must have for your DVD collection
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	As stated before, from the longest novel comes the shortest film. And I've no complaints. Again, the director cuts out most, if not all of the sub-plots, and just gives us a straight forward story with the main characters. Somethings have been altered as well, such as Cho Chang betraying Harry and the others from Cho's friend. Which in my opinion is the better dramatic angle as Cho's friend would've only been in this one movie and it wouldn't have had as much emotional impact on the characters. The main cast continues to improve and the older actors are still wonderful. Two of my new favorite characters, who practically stole the show for me when I saw this two years ago, are Helena Bonham Carter (who gets very good billing in this for being in it for a whole five minutes) as Bellatrix Lestrange and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood. Carter is wonderfully deranged as Bellatrix as the actress seems to be having a lot of fun being deliciously evil. Lynch is charmingly quirky and, despite this being her first film (I think), is excellent and I only hope that she continues to act several more films after the Potter series has wrapped. Imelda Staunton is very good as Umbridge but there's only so much I can take of the color pink and tedious crooked politician/sadistic teacher angle. I know that's how she is in the book but I find the character rather plain and not as interesting as some of the other plot-twist characters they've had before. Action wise, this is the one with the most of it, climaxing with a wizard's battle which is executed brilliantly (and one can only hope that the climatic battle in the final film will be just as exhilirating). Nicholas Hopper provides an excellent score, using Williams' themes to a minimum, utilizing some brilliant pieces of his own (the wizard battle being one of them).
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	How can Pixar continue to amaze us with each movie they do, and continue to raise the bar each time?  Story.  Story, and incredible animation.  Their movies aren't the simple thrown-together-done-on-a-computer-and-get-it-out-quick-for-some-quick-money computer animated movies as of late.  Their storys have heart.  A lot of heart.  And yes, their animination is second to none.  Cars is no different.  I'm not huge into Nascar, but this movie appeals on so many levels, there's something for everyone in it.  I won't rehash the plot here.  Trust me, it's very good.  You'll love the voice talent, you'll love the animation, and Pixar's never ending inside jokes thoughtout the movie.  And if you're a Pixar fan, you'll die over the end credits.  Buy this.  You will NOT be disapointed.

Jeff and his puppets are awesome...you will love watching Walter and Peanut along with the others. I have seen it several times and still laugh at the jokes!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie is fantastic. We have our entire family over each Thanksgiving and enjoy the tradition of watching a new movie after dinner. Everyone loved this movie! From the 2 year old kids to the 75 year old Great grandparents, the movie was a hit! Our nascar loving uncle really enjoyed it too!. the picture and sound are top notch. The story is terrific, and the DVD extras are actually worth watching.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	My husband read this book and, even though movie versions of books are usually somewhat disappointing, he really enjoyed this mini-series.  I thought it was fantastic, well portrayed and very enjoyable.
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	"Iron Man is solid super-hero fare which employs the traditional themes, tropes and symbols.  It should prove satisfactory to a broad audience, but could have been so much more satisfying, probing, or insightful if it used more clever storytelling.  Other than the themes it introduces about the military-industrial complex and US foreign policy, it is the same superhero origin story you have seen many times.<br /><br /> Robert Downey Jr. and Jeff Bridges offer excellent performances.  Downey Jr. mixes cocky arrogance, critical humor, and a compelling transformation of a character who represents the worst aspects of the military-industry complex experiencing an inner conflict over the destruction that his inventions have caused.  Jeff Bridges was terrific, but the film used him to less effect than it could have.  At the onset, I thought Bridges only touched on his potential usefulness, which is when he plays someone who is operating at many levels, particularly as ""the Dude"" in The Big Lebowski, where he is always up to something, and nothing, all at once.  So at the beginning, I thought he might be up to more than just helping out Tony Stark; but, his character shifted from a helper to a plain-old greedy bad guy without the transformation that I think Jeff Bridges could have pulled off if the film gave him the time and context to do that.  Gwyneth Paltrow offers a convincing performance of a woman who sees beneath Stark's stark exterior and sees the man behind the jerk, and the suit.<br /><br />The visuals, including Iron Man's heads-up displays and Tony Stark's computers and droids were fantastic.  The portrayal of the software underlying the hardware suit seemed to explain how this suit could actually work, and perhaps explains why this film could be made now instead of years ago - not only can digital rendering make a believable-looking suit for a movie, but the possibility of such a suit in today's world is itself more believable.  It's not a man in an iron suit, but a man with a multi-layered shell that is mediated through a software interface.  The film is aware of this, as Stark even comments on the newspaper's characterization of him as an iron man.  Nice touch.  Stark even suits up in a neoprene layer that would help to explain the buffer between him and the metal, as well as possible housings for the software - how the filmmakers missed the opportunity for an Under Armour product placement is beyond me!<br /><br /> The themes about US policy, weapons and industry lent an air of integrity to the film, but it seems those issues rapidly disappeared.  The irony, that Tony Stark becomes injured by the very weapons he manufactures, provides a great means to propel Stark toward his transformation.  The updating of the specific context from Vietnam (in the early comic books) to Afghanistan works very well, and shows that comic and superhero characters often reflect issues of their time and should be considered valuable forums for cultural dialogue.  However, the film seems less interested in those issues, and more interested in Stark's new suit.  It's unclear just what Stark's peace plan was, which means that although the film raises questions about responsibility and power (in both a personal, superhero sense and a national policy sense), it just leaves them behind to tackle the more personal issues and get the superhero flying around.  It could have also explored the theme of technological and human development, the boundary between machine and man, the exteriors we present to others compared with our inner needs and drives, etc.  Doing so would have made the film truly invincible, but unfortunately it just flies right on by those issues.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with the film, was that it was basically a two-hour origin story that followed, in the abstract, the same formula that every other superhero origin story follows.  Couldn't the writers have told us the origin story mixed in with a story progressing in the present?  I felt like I sat for two hours watching could have been a five or ten minute origin story.  Now that the film is over, I am ready to go see an Iron Man adventure!  In some ways, this is the problem with almost every super-hero movie - each new movie is just the same story with a new character, and then when it makes some money, the studio approves a sequel.  Two models that Iron Man could learn from are Star Wars and Speed Racer.  Part of why Star Wars (Episode IV) was so engaging is that Lucas explicitly left out the explanations - we were already caught up in an unfolding plot (he explains this in the audio commentary to the DVD releases that include the original film formats).  The opening sequence of Speed Racer manages to introduce the necessary origins at the same time it moves the current story forward.  Iron Man, however, is a movie about how another movie might yet come to be.  The filmmakers know this, and if you wait until after the credits, which for some reason I let the film run and caught this, you will see that they have one eye looking toward this future film.<br /><br />Although Iron Man is a fun film that has some great visuals, conceptualizations, acting and political relevancy, I wondered why I had to sit through yet another origin story.  It is solid, though, and should please comic fans and general audiences.  Now that I've gotten the origin story out of the way, I look forward to the first of the Iron Man Adventures!<br /><br />Format review:  The Blu-Ray disc that I watched has a nice special feature on the history of Iron Man, including interviews with Stan Lee and various other artists and writers who have worked on his stories."
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	I had a big grin on my face throughout this entire film.  I laughed out loud in many places, and cheered the characters on in others.  After 20 years, Indy is back, and so is the fun and excitement.<br /><br />As with every film in the series, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull starts off at warp speed and never lets up.  Like its three predecessors, this very entertaining film is full action, adventure, excitement, thrills, chases, true love and, yes, even camp.  Did I know what was going to happen pretty much every step of the way?  Of course, but it all happened exactly the way I wanted it to.  It was typical Indiana Jones, full of references and homage to the past films, and I did not need it to be anything else.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is once again brilliant in his portrayal of our hero.  At 65, he is still handsome, sexy, believable, and true to character.  And as always, he gets the girl.  Karen Allen is wonderful reprising her role of Marion Ravenwood.  She doesn't look like she has aged a bit, and she is absolutely terrific.  The chemistry between Indy and Marion is palpable.  Shia Labeouf as Mutt Williams does quite a remarkable job.  His high-speed sword fight through the Amazon is amazing and memorable.  I have to say the ants were an inspired choice for this film's requisite creepy-crawly scene.  We live in an area swarming with fire ants. I HATE ANTS.<br /><br />As always, John Williams' musical score is rousing and fills you with anticipation.  As the music set the perfect stage for all of the film's action, I found my self humming along with the familiar and well loved theme.  This is one that I can't get out of my head, and I don't really want to.<br /><br />Set in the 1950s, smack in the middle of McCarthyism, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull brings the Indiana Jones franchise into a new era. It is jam packed with classic and clich&eacute; 1950s references, from motorcycles and greasers, atomic bombs, Roswell and little green men, and the red menace. Overall, this film isn't supposed to be particularly serious (and neither were the others!). It is supposed to be a fun and enjoyable continuation of a well loved story.<br /><br />And I think it succeeded.  As the credits rolled, the audience applauded and cheered.  I highly recommend this film for the entire family.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Cars is one of the kids favorite movies. Got here fast no scratches, kids loved it.. Definitely some improvements in quality from the dvd
B001684L0A	3.0	b	"I'm clearly in the minority on this, but as much as I loved McCullough's book--I was already a fan of Adams from the Adams/Jefferson letters that I'd read--and as much as I wanted then to like this series--I just couldn't. It turned me off so much, in fact, I couldn't even finish it. The Adams in the HBO series just isn't the Adams I've come to know in McCullough's book, the Adams/Jefferson letters, and John/Abigail letters. Some of it is there, certainly, but Giamatti's performance is uniformly petulant, irritable, and whiny. I'm reminded of Dorothy Parker's criticism of Katherine Hepburn: ""She ran the whole gamut of emotions from A to B."" Adams certainly could be all three, but was clearly so much more--a more vital, gravitational personality--and you'll never see it--indeed, get even a glimpse of it--in HBO's John Adams. While in an obviously frothier vein, Bill Daniels' forceful portrayal of Adams in the film adaptation of the musical 1776 is far truer to the man described in the book and letters. He, at least, could convincingly be the Adams described by his peers and the match for Abigail, which was never the case for me with Giamatti's shrinking whiner. When he is supposed to be forceful, he merely comes off as a brat. At no point during the HBO series could I bring myself to believe that it was Giamatti's Adams that the other characters were talking about. He simply wasn't believable to me, to the extent that I simply couldn't watch him anymore. I had to retrieve the book and letters from my bookshelf to cleanse my palate and revisit the man of his words.<br /><br />Which is a criticism I have of the writing itself. Such work in a supposedly epic telling, and yet again I find a much more understandable presentation of Adams in the film 1776 than in four hours (so far) of HBO's production. After four episodes I still couldn't perceive a coherent philosophy, and challenge anyone watching it cold to produce one. The production spent far too much time on the minutiae of moments at the expense of a clear depiction of the man himself. Ultimately it was all about emotions--and again, only a couple of them--rather than thoughts. But then this is modern Hollywood's obsession--excessive but ultimately superficial verisimilitude--which is why its characterizations pale in comparison to the best of the past.<br /><br />The same problem extends to the production itself. There is a fanatical attention to detail, including superb visual and special effects, but once again at the expense of the story. Rather than simply putting a camera on an actor and letting him act, Adams' director Tom Hooper, like so many of his peers, feels he must ""put us in the moment"" with hand-held camera work and oblique camera angles, or create an interesting canvas through off-center compositions and muted colors. All he does instead is distract the viewer and draw attention to himself instead of the characters. Oh but for the chance to lock the present generation of directors in a room playing Ford, Huston, Hawks, and Wyler movies non-stop until they finally learn what they clearly never have about storytelling.<br /><br />I am happy, actually, that so many have enjoyed this series so much, but it's more than disappointing--aggravating--that the John Adams they're given is such a feral dog compared to the force of nature and penetrating mind, vain, stubborn, and obnoxious as it is, that comes through his letters."
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"I am a fan of the Alien universe series and knew I would have to watch and would probably wind up buying this one too. Well I saw it on opening day and found it to be a worthy addition to the franchise so I've pre-ordered the 3-D version and look forward to getting it when it becomes available. There are a number of unanswered questions the film leaves the viewer wondering about and I hope that I find some clues on my second viewing when the disc comes in.<br /><br />The movie itself is about a discovery which promises to reveal important information about the origins of man. An expedition is sent across space to try and uncover more truths about this discovery. What they find turns into a challenge for their survival as very unfriendly forces are unleashed which must be defeated or the crew from earth will all suffer death.<br /><br />The movie ends just as the story takes a new direction which is setting up the audience for a sequel. Should that one get made I'll probably get it too for my ""Alien"" collection. Although this story takes place in the familiar alien universe it is pre-Ripley and not directly related to the older movie, ""Alien."" The story line is similar in that a strong female personality survives adversity and an aberrant android with a hidden agenda complicates life for all of his unsuspecting shipmates.<br /><br />The movie was actually less violent than the previews of coming movies that were shown before ""Prometheus"" started. This is one of those sci-fi action flicks that are reasonably cerebral with sufficiently toned down violence to avoid running off the non-fan of the franchise.<br /><br />We found the movie satisfying and entertaining and I look forward to seeing it again. I recommend the movie for the fan of the franchise as well as general sci-fi action movies."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This mini-series is a stunning portrayal of John Adams and the creation of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The actors and actresses each are outstanding. I especially enjoyed Abigail Adams. This set of dvd's brings to life how this country was founded.<br />Every adult and school child needs to see this.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	Poorly thought out movie with even worse execution. By lazily putting Indy in his old get-up the filmmakers heighten Harrison Fords aged look. He reminded me of the old guys who wear pants too big and have to hike them up to their armpits. Storywise..if we skim past the fact that they are searching for aliens....which they find, and that there is a psychic character which is never explained...the plot lollops along from one rediculous set up to another. Want examples? name your poison!...surviving a nuclear bomb by hiding in a fridge?.. er swinging through the trees with a mass of cgi comedy monkeys, eaten by ants or whatever....just utter nonsense.<br />In no way encourage such fecal matter by buying this dross. Go buy Raiders of the lost Ark and try and remember a happier time when Indiana Jones was cool.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"ALERT! SOME REVEALS HERE!<br /><br />Anyone coming to this film w/o having seen the previous movies in the franchise has no grounds for complaint. However, as a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the books -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the stories as they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, as the movies *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative.<br /><br />Fundamental story matters are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it was explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the ""unnamed eighth"" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.)<br /><br />I've a fair eye for such details, so when major details like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film was almost unintelligible to me. That takes some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort.<br /><br />That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line makes more sense, and the gaps and flaws of part I are much less distracting so that the OTHER details of the story-telling can now shine through.<br /><br />Those other details really are very well done. But the flaws in the film make those finer moments difficult, if not impossible, to fully appreciate on the first viewing."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	i recommend this series to anyone who love watching shows about vampires. i am also watching the second series. it is awesome
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"The Coens return to ""Fargo"" territory with a blood-soaked tale of local yokels coming up against big city criminals, however, this time the result is completely reversed. Javier Bardem is creepy as a ""grim reaper"" type and Josh Brolin is excellent as an opportunist who gets in way over his head. Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson have small but telling parts as an old cop and ""fixer"", respectively. The only thing that detracts from this film - and the same is true of all Coen films - is the frequent and unnecessary brutality that the Coen's enjoy wallowing in."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	These Marvel comic movies just keep getting better. A must watch, and for a comic fans, especially, a must buy.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	It is side splittingly funny and worth every cent. They are coming to Ireland in April and I have my tickets already and cant wait.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	...  and its not over yet.  The Harry Potter series keeps getting better and better.  They do a marvelous job on each film.  Order of the Phoenix is the best film, it tops them all.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	a very good movie...i laughed so hard. Jeff dunham is one of my favorite comedians of all time!
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Yes, the violence is completely over the top and sensational. Yes, it is difficult to believe that a single man could take on a squad of fully armored riot police and win.  These are not what make this movie what it is.  What makes this movie one of the best I have seen in years lies in three areas:<br /><br />The first is believability of character.  I never onced doubted the  truth of these characters, definitely a testament to the skill of the actors involved.<br /><br />The second is a distinct and totally immersive style.  The colors the lighting all serve to bring you completely into Sin City.  This is due mainly to the films close adherence to the books it was based on. In fact with the exception of a few lines of dialog , Director Robert Rodriguez could not have adhered more closely to the comics.<br /><br />The third, and most important to me, is the completely real morality of this movie.  Morality in life is never black and white, although we might like it to be, it is always shades of gray.  This departure from your standard hollywood trash really puts this one over into 5star category.  This is one case where ambiguous is not a bad thing.  They are not all bad and they are not all good, they fall right in where the rest of us are.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, it comes with a very interesting behind the scenes featurette with cast interviews.  The DVD also shipped to me with a limited edition slipcover which is definitely an incentive to order early.<br /><br />In summary this film has incredible style, raw emotion and a refreshing realistic morality. All of which serves to make this one of the best films to come out in any category in the past several years.<br /><br />5 out of 5!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"My product came via UPS today and I decided to give it a trial run before I really start tomorrow. After the fit test and breathing like I'm running a marathon in the Sahara Desert, words can't explain how I feel right now. I'm an athletic female who is in very good shape but after the fit test I am now ready for bed. lol* My legs has a mind of it's own right now, but I'm going to stick with this workout. Even though the pain is unbearable; it's STILL a good pain. All my years in the gym and I've NEVER felt like this in such a short span of time. Yes it is challenging. Yes it is hard. And YES you're going to want to run down the street screaming like a banshee in the wind from the pain, but the final results will be worth every ounce of pain. Those of you who may shy away from this, DON'T! Don't be afraid of the unknown. What have you got to lose but weight. Just pace yourselves and REMEMBER ""Rome wasn't built in a day"" and the extra weight didn't appear in a day either. Have faith and believe in YOURSELVES and GOD and the rest is history! YOU CAN DO IT! I look forward to starting tomorrow. Good luck to you all and God bless!<br /><br />***UPDATE*** I MUST start off by saying how amazing this program is!!!! Since I've started (4/22/11) I'm noticing a difference in my physique. I don't own a scale so I'm going by the way my clothes fit and pictures. For those of you making excuses as to why you can't start, STOP making excuses and JUST DO IT! Before you say I have no time, too much to do, etc. I will give a quick run down of my schedule. I'm a FULL-TIME college student (on campus NOT online), I work FULL-TIME 7:30a-6:00p, I also go to school on Saturday from 8a-4p, I also take care of an ailing parent, as well as a young adult mentor. I still have to cook my meals (I don't eat out; my preference), clean, etc. I'm sure you get the drift. With all this going on I still make time for ME! I've stuck to it and I will continue to stick to it. This post is ESPECIALLY for women. I know sometimes it can get hard and it is, but would life really be worth living without the challenges to make us STRONGER?!? BELIEVE in YOURSELF! YOU can do ANY and EVERYTHING you put your mind to. Hang in there and God bless!"
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This was money well spent.  I received what I was supposed to and there were no problems.
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	This was a really great movie the whole family could watch!  So refreshing for a change.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	The movie is fun to watch.  It's not too serious but it isn't campy either.  The effects were top notch and the Robert plays a great Stark in my opinion.  The only thing I sort of dislike is the ending, the bit after the credits.  It reminds me of all that crossover nonsense that happens in the comic books which really kills comic books for me.  Plus I find Samuel a tough actor to like now a days.  But that's just me.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	My boyfriend and I were watching this and he probably summed it up best saying that the movie really has substance.  It's definitely an instructive and thought-provoking watch if you're interested in building a relationship with a spouse/potential spouse and understanding the role that God/Jesus should play in that being successful.  It's disturbing at the beginning of the movie to see how broken the marriage of the main characters is and how little hope there seems to be for repairing that sort of damage, but ultimately the transformation and redemption is very believable and the message is awesome.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"Iron Man  (2008) One of Marvel Comics' coolest, if not most famous superheroes finally gets brought to the big screen for the first time in this new flick from director Jon Favreau. Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a brilliant billionaire industrialist and weapons manufacturer carrying on the legacy of his late father in designing bigger and better weapons to protect this great land of ours. He is a hard drinking, womanizing, self centered vanity case, but his charm carries him, along with the piles of money he makes. While on a junket in Afghanistan to show off his newest missile, Stark's convoy is attacked and he is caught by a ruthless Afghani terrorist cabal. The attack left Stark with deadly shrapnel in his chest, threatening his heart, but a fellow scientist prisoner manages to cobble together a nasty looking but effective electromagnetic pacemaker and jam it into Stark's chest to hold the shrapnel at bay. The terrorists want Stark to build them one of his new missiles, but seeing them using his weaponry, devices he created to protect Americans, which there should be no way they could have, Stark has a figurative change of heart to go along with his literal one. He agrees to make the rocket, and makes a list of materials he'll need. When the baddies give him the goods however, he instead cobbles together a clunky but highly effective armored battlesuit he uses to wipe out most of the villains and escape. Back in America, Stark picks up his old life with Air Force pal Rhodey (Terrence Howard), mentor Stane (Jeff Bridges), and especially Girl Friday Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). He does have to deal with wearing a glowing chest ornament the size of a small dinner plate, but no Marvel Comics hero's life is perfect, no matter how much money he has. Stark also takes the battlesuit design further, building a sleeker, faster version that turns him fully into the superhero Iron Man. Now, with all this high tech weaponry at his disposal, he has to find out who has sold him out by selling his weapons design to Afghani terrorists. And, unknown to Stark, that same someone is using the pieces of his first design to reverse engineer an even larger, more deadly battlesuit. Once again, jumping right into line with ""Michael Keaton as Batman"" I wasn't sure an Iron Man movie starring Robert Downey Jr and directed by Jon Favreau would be what I wanted it to be. And once again I couldn't have been more wrong. Downey is totally committed and up to the game, giving Stark a roguish charm that is simply perfect, and he's not afraid to let the identity hiding armor take over when Iron Man shows up. Of course, it doesn't hurt that unlike Spider-Man, director Favreau can cut to close-ups of Downey inside the armor, so we the audience still get to see all the emotions the actor's face can show without having to rip the hero's mask off in every scene. The casting is perfect down the line, with every actor and actress looking exactly like the comics' version, and that extends to the moment after the credits too many people will have missed, a fine bit that promises more fun to come AND ties this film directly to another summer release this year. (Crossover sequel anyone?) Kudos to director Favreau for balancing the action and lighter moments, and providing a lot of flash bang but not letting the movie coast on the effects. (He also takes a prime role for anyone familiar with Iron Man's comics backstory as chauffeur ""Happy"" Hogan, who doesn't get a lot of screen time here, but promises to show up more in the sequel and get some quality time with Paltrow!) All in all a fun flick I highly recommend to those so inclined."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	My 3-year-old son loves the movie and wants to see it over and over again. And I like it too!
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I bought this to compliment the rest of the Blu-Ray box sets that I own. I love the design of the box and the extras that were included.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Our family, including our 5 children ages 7 to 14, was enthralled with this movie.  Ben Stein does a terrific job interviewing folks.  The movie contains lots of clips from other sources which are witty and entertaining.  Although our younger children didn't really understand the message, they were entertained.  Our older children understood at different levels - even I will need to watch it several times to fully comprehend everything presented.  The end is shocking, and absolutely amazing.  Everyone should know what the evolution theory elite truly believe, as they admit on camera in this film.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	this movie was amazing, Ridley Scott did an amazing job. i'm not sure why people are complaining. i am a huge alien fan since it started in 87. the alien movies are legendary. Prometheus did raise some questions but it also answered many questions as well. why the aliens were created, whats their purpose. and the whole conspiracy behind Wayland corp. Prometheus also had a lot of H.R. Gigers'( the artist of the alien movies) art elements in it, even more than the original alien movies. the acting was perfectly done, especially David the android.<br />in my opinion they did a fantastic job in bringing the art of h.r. Giger on cinema and to give the whole alien series an actual beginning.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	My order was pretty much smooth...shipped the same day I ordered it. Loved the low shipping fee. The product was in pretty good condition can't complain. But i did notice that one of the dvds was missing but i just substitute it with another dvd so no big deal although i would like to have had it in the first place. As for the workout all i can say is that it is NO JOKE! Love doing the workouts. I feel like i get a really good workout after im done. The nutritional gide is great!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"There will probably never be a ""superhero"" movie that will stand the test-of-time as a full-blown movie CLASSIC.  Could there every be a CITIZEN KANE of some guy in a brightly colored costume flying around saving people?  Probably  not.<br /><br />But as POPULAR entertainment, some superhero movies offer more pure entertainment snap and sizzle and fun than others.  SPIDERMAN 2 overcame the silliness of the comic-book genre with some genuinely exciting and eye-popping action sequences.  BATMAN BEGINS created a visual feast of a world, and populated it with actors full of gravitas.  Even HELLBOY won out by bringing a tongue-in-cheek attitude to the whole thing.  But for me (and I'm NOT a real ""fan-boy""), IRON MAN is the most well-rounded effort in this genre that I've yet seen.  The highest complement I can think to pay is that when I left the theater, I was ready to see more IRON MAN movies right away.  I  was so thoroughly enjoying myself that I wasn't ready to leave yet.<br /><br />This is due in HUGE part to the splendid performance from Robert Downey Jr.  Certainly the least likely superhero casting since Michael Keaton donned Batman's tight garb...but also perhaps the most inspired.  Downey is convincing as Tony Stark, the brilliant, hedonistic and fabulously wealthy arms manufacturer.  Stark pops with Downey's trademark under his breath, quickly mumbled jabs and bursts of wit.  He's on edge, always on the go.  We can see that his mind is moving a mile a minute...juggling a dozen things at once.  Downey's intelligence is palpable...and so is his devil-may-care-attitude.  It's nearly perfect for Stark.  And the good thing about IRON MAN is that he's really a ""weapon"" designed and built by a brilliant man...not a super-power brought on by circumstance from a spider bite.<br /><br /> Early in the film, Stark is visiting Afghanistan to show off a new weapon.  He's soon kidnapped and nearly killed by a Taliban-like band of terrorists, who hold him hostage and force him to build a copy of his latest weapon.  Instead, with the help of a fellow prisoner (a doctor who both saves his life and dooms him to a lifetime of heart problems)...Stark brazenly builds an escape mechanism.<br /><br />I really hate to give away more plot...because it's fun to watch the story unwind.  Downey is fully of great energy, and could carry the movie on his own.  Fortunately for us, we've also got Gweneth Paltrow (Stark's unfortunately named assistant Pepper Potts).  Paltrow has been away for a few years raising a family (GREAT for her!), but I'd nearly forgotten that in the right role, she can really be a lot of ""saucy"" fun.  It's a clich&eacute;d role, but she makes the most of it.  Jeff Bridges is Stark's business-partner (and later nemesis), Obadiah Stane.  (Great name.)  Bridges is shaved bald, but has a big beard...making him a striking figure.  He's smooth, silky and creepy.  Shaun Taub, who was SO good in THE KITE RUNNER, is Stark's fellow prisoner, and he does another masterful job portraying a wise older gentleman with a streak of frisky humor and a big soft spot.  He's a very good character actor, and I hope to see more of him.<br /><br />Two fairly minor quibbles with the film.  1)  Terrance Howard, as Tony's longtime friend and military liaison...is somewhat lost in his role.  To me, it's now been awhile since he gave a performance that did much for me.  He's not fulfilling his early promise.  2)  The film needs a little more action.  This is also a back-handed compliment.  For once, the flying character actually looks fairly convincing...and I wanted to enjoy more pure thrills.  I love the witty banter, the crackling dialogue and I liked the action scenes.  I wanted just a bit more of Iron Man blowing stuff up.  Don't get me wrong, it's not like this movie is stuffy and unexciting...it's just that the action was just so much fun, I actually wanted more  (unlike the action in an overstuffed film like PIRATES 3, for example...where I was craving a break!).<br /><br />So while this movie is ONLY popular entertainment...it's the best kind.  Fun, fast, witty, exciting and well-acted.  And with Robert Downey firmly in charge...it's a far cut above the average.  Absolutely for ""non-fans"" too!!"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I love the True Blood series because I love the book series.  Just wish they would show more Eric.  The series sticks to the important parts of the book series.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This was absolutely the best movie I have seen.  I have been married 50 yrs and believe they have developed the perfect God centered marriage.  All new couples should see this movie.  Good movie.  Kitty
B001OHS8BQ	3.0	b	I am a Christian and married and this movie was great and opened my mind up on how to work more positive on my marriage. Watching Kirks charactor grow and save his marriage was an awsome journey.<br /><br />The other actors where horrible and made it hard to believe their situations. the effects where almost as bad. but if you can get past those and enjoy the movie for what it is teaching that is main point.<br /><br />3 stars for the story, very strong<br />minus 1 star for the horrible acting<br />minus 1 star for the poor visuals
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I absolutely love this movie!!! I am not a car lover, but a disney lover and I am 24 years old. I hope that one day when I have kids, they will enjoy it too. Please, buy this. Trust me, you will love this!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	I love Jeff Dunham and find him funny.....but the description of this video says that Peanut is a purple gay monkey...first off, he's not a dang monkey, if anything he's a refuge from a UFO!! geez, have the people who write these descriptions even seen the show????<br />Jeff Dunham is hilarious, Peanut, Walter, Jose on a stick, and his newest, Akmed the terrorist, will keep you laughing for hours.... you will want to watch this over and over and over again, and play you whenever you have someone over to your house!
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	Follows the storyline of the Indy movies and compliments<br />the series. Great for all ages. helps to have seen the<br />previous Indy movies, but not a must.<br />I reserve a five star movie for one that, makes me sob,<br />laugh till I cry, or can't blink in amazement.<br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is<br />worth the $17.00 Amazon want for it.
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	I think the cards were stacked against Steven Speilberg. He had no choice but to direct this film because Harrison Ford thought it would be a good idea to have a fourth Indiana Jones flick. I'm a big fan of the Indiana Jones series and even though this movie does not meet the standards of the other three, I am keeping that DVD because I am a completist.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I love this product! I am on the recovery week right now and it has been tough, but I can already see changes in my body. I even needed to buy a belt, and my tummy is my trouble spot when it comes to losing weight!
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	yeah, that about describes the movie 'sin city'.<br /><br />don't be taken in by its hard hitting razzle-dazzle visual nonsense and its self-important comic book story telling.<br /><br />why this movie got so much attention from people and critics alike beats me.<br /><br />not impressed.
B000S5KGH4	3.0	b	While I throughly enjoyed the performance, I am hard of hearing and could not believe that this DVD was not close captioned for the hearing impared.  Had to turn TV all way up to hear.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	So why buy this copy insted of the normal one, without the extra stuff and the book?<br /><br />Well if you arnt a big fan of Sin City like I am then you probably shouldnt buy this copy, but if you are... I garantee you joy, for hours!<br /><br />The extra stuff gives you a great view over the making of Sin City, everything from the cars to the costumes.<br /><br />And the comic book is a bit small. Way smaller then the original size but its still great.<br /><br />so that doesnt stop me from giving this produkt 5stars.<br /><br />If you like Sin City, havnt read the comics yet THEN this produkt will probably be the best purchase ever.
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	This movie punches above its weight.  The production values, dialog, and acting are nothing remarkable, but the film has an emotional core that is compelling and rewarding, particularly if you have ever been through a divorce.<br /><br />The only real negative I have, is that while Kirk Cameron gives a decent performance, he just doesn't have the physical presence to be believable as a firefighter.  He almost looks lost in the hat and uniform!  Plus the movie would likely have had all the more poignancy if a bigger tougher guy had learned the path of unconditional giving and love.  But overall, that is a minor point.<br /><br />P.S. Re. the whole evangelizing thing: if you're not a Christian, all you have to do is view the movie as a story about love and marriage that just happens to be set within the context of contemporary Christian culture.  Just sit back and enjoy it for what it is, secure in the knowledge that it is probably not going to corrupt you.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"The movie, ""Fire Proof"", is ideal for a husband and wife to understand their union.  Two imperfect people unite in what we call marriage; yet each of us is self-centered.  So, it's a learning process that takes patience and consideration from each of the partners.<br /><br />In the movie, there is a booklet called, ""The Love Dare"".  This (now a book by that name) is an indispensable companion to making a steadfast marriage union.<br /><br />I heartedly recommend both of these items!"
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"I'm not going to go on and on in my review, but I do consider myself a big fan of the Alien franchise, with Aliens being one of my all time favorite movies.  I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie but I will say now that I loved it and I think it is just what the franchise needs to save it from the ridiculous Alien: Erection film and the AvP films (although the predator/alien fight scene in AvP 1 was pretty bad @$$)!<br /><br />They did a much better job on choosing actors this time compared to the above mentioned films in the series and I think Noomi Rapace was a great choice for the main.  Like the other reviewers have said, they do some stupid things sometimes...like wanting to pet what looks like some kind of a lethal alien snake, but overall, they're good!<br /><br />It has a controversial plot.  I loved it!  But I think it will anger the atheist crowd somewhat as the main actor still believes in God nearly 100 years from now.  This shouldn't be a reason to give the movie a 1 star rating.  And it may anger the Christians a bit by saying an alien race created us (I'm a bit of a spiritual agnostic/ancient astronaut theory kinda guy myself).<br /><br />The special effects are bad @$$!  The lighting/sets/costumes/ships and especially the storms are all done great!<br /><br />I was thinking we would see the ""alien"" a bit more but this movie's intention was to tell us more about the ""space jockey"" (although I hate that nickname) and after watching it last night, I'm glad they made it the way they did!  The ending left a lot of questions unanswered and undoubtedly left it open for part 2.  Hopefully we'll be able to find out what happens next very soon.<br /><br />With that said, disregard the minor controversy and if you're an Alien fan or not, its a must see!"
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	I found this movie dreary, interminable, and boring.  Around 1/4 way through, I ceased caring about Harry Potter and the whole confusing mess and stuck it out for another 1/3 until I gave up and went to bed.  I fast-forwarded through the rest of it this afternoon while my wife secluded herself so she could watch it later.  I felt the same way about the books as the series progressed, so it's not surprising.  It's also got the darkest (literally) cinematography and lighting I've ever seen on film.  I can't recommend this movie for anyone except the most devout fans, who've no doubt already seen it and will love it no matter what I say.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	We have the entire series of movies and will buy the last one as well, but this one was particularly well done and included all the pertinent details.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Okay, so I'm following the whole super hero thing primarily because they are great action films that allow me to use the full functionality of my 3D TV along with my 7.1 surround sound system.  I almost never go to a movie any more.  After taking my grandson to the movies to see super 8, I may never go to a movie again unless it's an IMAX movie.  Super 8 was way better on blu ray in my living room.  I kid you not. By the way, that is also a very good movie that is full of nuance.I just wait for the Blu Ray release, make some popcorn and sit back and enjoy.  It's way cheaper.  That being said, this movie well made the grade for such an endeavor.<br /><br />The storyline is tight, well told, well paced and well acted.<br /><br />About the only complaint that I can make has to do with the sound.  I found myself using close-caption since some parts of the movie was inaudible.<br /><br />This tragedy...yes I said tragedy is found in alot of movies now-a-days.  What the heck are the producers thinking when they know that great technology is at their fingertips.  What's all of the mumbling about?  I'm sure that I'm not the only one screaming about this.  Why mumble when you can speak. Clearly. Decisively. With intent. So that you can be heard. Through one or eight speakers.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this cannot be blamed on the actors. Weight must fall on the directors and producers.  If the mike can pick up the slightest sound, then have the actor stand back a little to match the mike. How hard is this?<br /><br />Fortunately, movies made since the time of the release of this one seem to be made better and with more attention paid regarding spoken voice audibility.  If you are going to see the avengers this year then you must see this movie since it is an integral part of that storyline. Not withstanding the crappy audio, I still highly recomment this movie because it is a great storyline with stellar action.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	This movie is lean, solid entertainment. It wastes no time, is well paced and smartly written with snappy dialogue and good subtext. The action delivers the goods, but not at the expense of story or character.<br /><br />  Most importantly, this movie is FUN! Robert Downey Jr. is a one man party onscreen - funny, smart and compelling to watch throughout. It seems as though he's having more fun than should be legal ( I know, don't tempt him).<br /><br />  The effects are breathtaking, seamlessly switching from practical to cg without calling attention to artifice - a major feat these days. All the gadgetry seemed plausible somehow and delivered ( for me at least ) a sense of giddy wish fulfillment - I totally bought that this guy could fly around in a high tech suit of armor.<br /><br />  Gwyneth Paltrow is a pleasant surprise. I have to admit that I was ambivalent about her, but here she's great, and mines a layer of vulnerability in her character that could have easily been unrealized by lesser talent. Oh, and did I mention that she looks really HOT?!?! She looks really HOT!<br /><br />  Terrence Howard is good as the straight man and there were a couple male-bonding scenes with Downey Jr. that rang as being particularly genuine.<br /><br />  Jeff Bridges ( always a pleasure ) does a great job of taking his character from ambiguous manipulator to outright villain without any breaks in logic or motivation.<br /><br />  The movie balances humor, drama and action with a light tone while still managing a fairly serious subtext about war profiteering and global violence.<br /><br />  It all adds up to one of the most entertaining popcorn flicks around and a serious contender for 'best superhero movie' award. A better time at the movies is hard to find.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	The movie is very intense, disturbing with lots of slice and dice blood and gore. It still is a very entertaining movie. The unique style of filming which blends comic book style visuals with very dark overtone, makes the movie an excellent choice for the comic book enthusiast. The story line is good - but not great. There are weak threads in the movie which though not absolutely necessary, do weaken the fabric of the movie. The characters are excellent and very well developed and at the end of the movie you feel like you just read a 200 pages intense comic book with some richly designed visuals. If cannibalism, unnecessary killing and every other psycho habit that you can think of - disturbs you, then do not watch this flick. If you're thicks skinned, get this!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	From the first episode I was hooked. Vampires, romance, action, and drama all in one season. I highly recommend this for vampire fanatics.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	After having watched all of the Aliens movies numerous times, this movie does a fantastic job of both explaining there they came from without giving away too much.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Since I read all of the books before getting into the show, I was expecting not to like the HBO series. I never like screen adaptations as much as the original. That being said, I was caught off guard when I actually really like the first few episodes. I have only watched the first four, but I am hooked. I hear that the show strays a lot from the books later on, but for some reason it doesn't bother me (yet). The acting is great.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	Thanx guys for destroying one of my childhood heros. You just weren't satisfied with raping the holy trinity, were you?
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	The quality of the movie is excellent. Not much in the way of bonus features though.
B0006989TE	1.0	b	"The movie's been going for an hour and a half and all they've done is send a blind girl alone into a most dreaded and feared forest! Why? To preserve their probably already doomed way of life. And what is that way of life? It is the way of life of an eightteenth century-like village of paranoids who have chosen to isolate themselves from tewnty-first century life, which they all for their own reasons equate with supreme evil. The place they locate their village is very stupid or very unlucky one of the two. For the nearby woods are infested with some unspeakable evil that menaces the village. Just what that evil is will keep you in suspense the whole way through. But believe me, there will never be an answer worth waiting for. When the blind sojourner reaches some other form of (civilization?!?), what does it turn out to be? A mysterious wildlife refuge of some sort. Did the villagers knowingly locate their village adjacent to a preserve inhabited by some dread beasts? The one suggestion that they might have is that some head honchos of the village have the name Walker. And what is the refuge's name? It's the Walker Wildlife Refuge! So one suspects there is a more than coincidental connection and juxtaposition between the village and the refuge. But just what is that connection? I have no idea, even though I watched  the movie. And believe me. It's not worth troubling your mind over. The refuge is made very mysterious, to be sure! We hear two wildlife officers talk briefly and just in that we know that the place reeks of intriguing secrecy that would make the fabled ""Area 51"" look about as mysterious as Sam's Club or Incredible Universe by comparison. But such is just the problem herein. This movie has diarrhea of mystery and constipation of solution! Just accept it that the movie is a mystery less destined toward a solution that a blind girl wandering alone through a menacing forest. And why was she sent into the forest in the first place? A member of the village committed a murder - no, a near-murder, since the victim was clinging to life. The girl was sent in search of medicine. And who is the attempted murdered? Some reviews call him ""the village idiot"". But, duh! How did they ever guess? No, I mean seriously, how were we to know? I think the term ""village idiot"" owes its existence to the fact that in a small village an ""idiot"" can stand out by virtue of being the only ""idiot"" there. But in THIS village, who ISN'T a good candidate for being an idiot? Virtually everyone here acts in manners rash, inscrutible, and potentially idiotic. So if the movie meant for this character to stand out as a ""village idiot"" they were so barking up the wrong tree, not just that, up the wrong freaking forest!  When everyone in this flick acts so freaking wierd, at least it is acting. But that is no redeeming feature, unfortunately. The film does have (read waste) some prominent actors, such as William Hurt and Adrian Brody, who acted so bizarre that  I had no idea it was them until afterwards. And even Sigourney Weaver had me guessing for the first half who she was, so thouorghly was she in hot pursuit of not playing herself for once! Acting, eerieness, suspense -- this movie has it all! All, that is, except anything ultimately happening to make us care a whit about all that acting, eerieness, and suspense! Suck on that! e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e!"
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	Thought is was boring and pretentious.  Don't get at all why some people love this movie.  It tried to be intelligent but was really just overblown
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Obviously, everyone knows this is a great movie.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the second (bonus)disc.  The mini-documentary about Whitey Bulger was a little short (around 20 minutes), but was very informative.  The Scorcese on Scorcese segment was outstanding.  It comes from (I beleive) an A&E documentary where the director talks about many of his major works.  It was very interesting to hear what his thought processes were while making some of his (many) legendary movies.  There are also the obligatory bonus scenes which were mildly entertaining, but really, felt like they were there because they always are on bonus discs.  Nevertheless, on balance, the bonus disc is great, and a worthy companion to what I feel is the best movie of 2006.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"This was the very first 3D movie I watched on my Mitsubishi 65"" DLP TV with Xpand103 glasses.  I had never seen the entire movie before and had no idea what to expect.  The movie itself completely came alive with the 3D depth.  I was mesmerized from beginning to end.  This isn't in-your-face 3D:  it adds to the experience instead of being the movie's focus.  I loved the falling snow in the beginning, the rollercoaster-style scenes, the train skidding across the ice, the ticket in the wind, etc etc.  The 3D clarity was amazing with virtually zero ghosting.  Some of the facial expressions did seem artificial but this is 2004 technology.  All things considered, this move was VERY impressive.  I enjoyed the storyline as well....not too much syrupy holiday sweetness.  I can't wait to watch this movie again....I just wish the DVD extras were in 3D!"
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This video is a must-see for all persons who wish to see United States history come alive.  With few instances of artistic license, it stays close to David McCullough's historical work, and informs as it entertains.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	... but that acting.  Wow, really really bad.  This was the first time I have seen Kristen Stewart and if I see her in a film again I won't bother.  Much like the John Carter lead, she was completely incapable of making me care one whit what happened to her.  After awhile I kept glancing at my watch to see how much more I had to take.  I wish they had picked someone who could act to play the role.  Theron did a pretty good job as well as the rest of the crew, but Stewart completely ruined the film.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie is a must have for any boy's parent! Our 3 year old has asked for it to be played at least four times since yesterday (when it arrived), and our 1 year old gets all excited and starts making car noises when he watches it with his brother. The movie is very entertaining, with an excellent soundtrack, a good story and best of all, it teaches a lesson. Way to go Disney/Pixar!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"I rec this movie if only to hear D day ""I did not mean to kill only to maim ooooooh seriously injure.""  LOL!!!!!!!<br /><br />A great next installment of HP movies.  The progression from the first to this one is stunning and fun.<br /><br />:)"
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"Other reviewers have stressed the importance of doing some background homework before seeing this movie.  That's because the film, while making sense to people who've seen the others and read the books, won't to those who haven't.  Even if you are a diehard Harry fan, you'll probably have your own opinions about what ought to have been included, and what wasn't.  You may feel that some characters deserved more screen time and more of a backstory. But you'll probably agree that the second-to-last movie in the ""Harry"" series does a more than competent job of adapting the (unwieldy plotwise) book.<br /><br />If you're going in cold, you may wonder things like, ""What the heck is Horcrux?""  ""Why aren't the kids still in school?""  ""Who are all these characters that only get a few minutes of screen time and disappear without any real explanation?"" and so on.  Well, the kids have decided not to return to school after Headmaster Dumbledore's death in the last movie.  A Horcrux is a piece of soul, and Voldemort has figured out a way to split himself into seven different ones. Before the final showdown with Voldy, Harry must recover all these Horcruxes. That's why he goes on that camping trip with just his two pals.  Harry also has a telepathic connection with Voldy (again not explained) which allows him to be suddenly plunged into Voldy's memory.  That accounts for some of the odd flashbacks.<br /><br />For most of the movie, Harry, Hermione and Ron are on their own, dodging the frequent magic hurled at them by Voldemort's crew, while searching for Horcruxes and trying to decipher why Dumbledore left them each a gift in his will. Most of the major characters from the previous films (who haven't died) pop in for an appearance including Alan Rickman as the nefarious Severus Snape; Imelda Stanton as former Hogwart's Headmistress who now holds a position in the Ministry of Magic; and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Harry's nemesis who has also been forced to grow up rather fast. Ralph Fiennes plays Voldemort capably as usual, but the villian who looks like she's having the most fun is Helena Bonham Carter, as Bellatrix.  (Sadly, there is no Neville, but I expect we'll see him in the next film.)<br /><br />You could argue that so much of the movie is unrelentingly bleak, spends too much time on the Great Camping Trip, etc., but all these things can also be said of the book it's based on.  I, for one, felt a bit cheated at having to wait for yet another film, but to be fair, I don't see how the book would be better as a single film. So I'd recommend it anyway."
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"PROMETHEUS may be a prequel to ALIEN, but fixating too much on making those connections will probably sabotage your overall enjoyment of the film. After more than three decades Ridley Scott returns to the franchise that established a new watershed mark for sci-fi horror. That's plenty of time to stew things over for a sequel. But while PROMETHEUS does address a few questions, it frustratingly raises even more. Case in point, the mystery of the Space Jockey figure. Still, I appreciate that the narrative doesn't spoonfeed you the answers.<br /><br />In 2093 the deep space vessel Prometheus, spurred by a clue 35,000 years old, journeys to a distant and inhospitable moon in search of mankind's origins. Prometheus is manned by a crew of seventeen, many of them anonymous cannon fodder. On the barren moon a scouting team eyes a vast, unnatural construct and explores it. Inside they find air that is breathable... and the remains of an ancient alien civilization.<br /><br />Prepare to be gobsmacked by the eloquence and scope of Ridley's storytelling. The set designs are magnificently realized and, gratifyingly, still very much influenced by H.R. Giger's ominous surrealism. For those who may get their Scotts and Camerons confused, PROMETHEUS is more reminiscent of ALIEN in its slow burn evocation of atmosphere and tone. The tone itself is contemplative. There's an exploration into the metaphysical stuff, into the relationship between science and religion. The story takes its time but builds to a blistering crescendo. The spooky bits are parceled out in measured doses; Scott once more prefers to let your imagination do the work. Honestly, the film is heavy on mood but light on terror. It does eventually unleash several nice scares, and ****REST-OF-SENTENCE SPOILER NOW**** particularly one harrowing moment involving a cringe-inducing bout of self-surgery.<br /><br />Next to THE AVENGERS and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, PROMETHEUS is this summer's most anticipated film. Which leaves it vulnerable for a letdown, expectations being so high. Those going in the theater salivating for a comprehensive backstory will probably exit grumbling. There is a connective tissue, but Ridley Scott doesn't confine himself to the ALIEN mythos and with crossing t's and dotting i's. He expands on it, paints a bigger canvas. He introduces even more concepts. He lays in the puzzle of the Space Jockeys, who we learn are genetic engineers who may have created humanity. We're left questioning their motivations with regards to the human race.<br /><br />The film gives us expert direction, staggering visual effects, marvelous acting. Noomi Rapace's archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw emerges as our point-of-view character. She starts out as this sort of sweet, unprepossesing scientist willing to be coddled by her more adventurous scientist partner. In time, when it all turns to sh--, we see her channel the strength and awesome kickassery of Sigourney Weaver (although Rapace doesn't quite match Weaver's thunder). A deliciously creepy Michael Fassbender plays David, the android whose motivations seem mercurial and ever suspect. The excellent Idris Elba, as the laid back ship's captain, provides a dash of levity and a much needed human touch. And stepping in the shady Paul Reiser ""company man"" role, Charlize Theron is so icy and impassive that debate immediately surfaces regarding her true nature. Is she or isn't she? What she is, is underused.<br /><br />I rate PROMETHEUS 3.5 out of 5 stars. The stuff I liked, I liked very much. But the flaws... aaaiiyeeee! Or is that perceived flaws? I'm a bit torn about something. I refer to Ridley Scott's measure of ambiguity and his reluctance to produce those big reveals, to provide an even more pronounced connective tissue to ALIEN. One thought is that he's holding out for a sequel, in which case I'm on board. There's something to be said for slow burn gratification. But other elements undermine the film. Bits of metaphysical exposition come off as heavyhanded. I hate that a sizable chunk of the narrative stems from the scientists' making so many poor choices. Personnel eschew proper protocol. They throw caution to the winds and discard their oxygen helmets. They abandon their observation posts for a quickie while other crewmen are stranded off the ship. They think menacing tentacles emerging from inky pools are cute and harmless. I won't even go into Guy Pearce's unconvincing old man make-up. These nitpicks wouldn't be as readily apparent were this film not a furtherance of the classic ALIEN mythology. You can probably brush them off on BATTLESHIP or the TRANSFORMERS sequels. But there's a level of intelligence attached to this franchise that is compromised here. So, to sum it up, PROMETHEUS is a dazzling, powerful visual feast and thought-provoking enough, and it does give you moments in which you make those instant connections. Its grand scope absolutely begs for a viewing in the movie theater (you can probably give the 3-D a pass). I wouldn't mind seeing the survivor(s) in a follow-up picture. I wish it were better."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN<br /><br />What took me so long to watch this movie?  Lord, I was swept into this thriller immediately and the time just flew by while watching.  I will admit to jumping and being scared and having the willies -- yes, even today in broad daylight I am still a little unsettled.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones, fantastic as always, as a small-town sheriff.  Javier Bardem as the BAD guy, which doesn't even begin to describe him.  Such talent in this flick!  Drug-dealers, stolen money,even humor and some laughs, brutal, cold-stone murders, and tons of surprises and thrills.<br /><br />I did not know Javier Bardem as an actor, but what an impression he made on me!  He is such a great actor that he made me fear him, hate him, and now I can't stop thinking about him!  Where have I been all this time that I didn't know he existed?  Well, now I have just ordered most of his movies from Netflix!!!  Wow, is he going to ALWAYS be the BAD guy? Maybe he should be because he is AWESOME at being bad!<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and many, many more actors/actresses did a totally great job in this movie.  Get this, lock the doors and windows, and enjoy.  I will not soon forget this movie.  No young kids in the room, please.<br /><br />ENJOY!  YIKES!<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Pam
B0032CNOK6	2.0	b	"I finally got to see Expelled.<br />Found it quite moving to my surprise. Its pretty far off of course, but as a craft I enjoyed it.<br />Expected much worse.<br /><br />First off I want to say what screams needs to be said to you Intelligent Design supporters:<br />Believe what you want. You are free to believe that we live in a giant teapot if you like. You are free to believe that Noahs Ark existed and we all are sons of Noah and his zoo-ship. Its just that as long as you can't find any evidence for it, thats more than inside your imaginiation and part of your religious faith, then science can't test it. Its impossible.<br /><br />Scientific American editor John Rennie said this about Intelligent Design.<br />""a notion which firmly states that at one or more unspecified times in the past, an unidentified designer who might or might not be God somehow created whole organisms, or maybe just cells, or maybe just certain parts of cells--they're still deciding and will get back to you on that.""<br /><br />The other problem is that questioning Darwin's theories in these days is just extremely sad. I know you want to believe your Bible and Quran so much.. but the evidence for evolution is mindbogglingly and breathtakingly enormous. And in reality lots of religious people believe in evolution, even if Ben Stein tries to hide them with this film. Look up Ken Miller. Look up Robert Winston. Heck, even the Pope has accepted evolution.<br /><br />Ben Stein and the Expelled squad does something really dirty with this movie. They interviews only the Intelligent Design defenders in this movie, versus. a lot of atheist scientists who defends in evolution. That's the main problem of this movie. It tries to present a fictional harsh battle between religion and evolution. Thats propaganda! They could have interviewed some religious people who believes in evolution too, as that there is lots and that would would be interesting, but that wouldn't suit Ben Stein's attempt to alienate the viewer from evolution.<br /><br />Instead we see Stein walking inside Darwins museum, with cold eerie music and dark pictures, staring a statue of Charles Darwin cold in the eyes, like he's looking for a sign of humanity in there.<br /><br />Another problem is that we're not presented to what intelligent design IS. No explanation. Which is of course because it isn't a coherent theory. I bet if you asked all those various people Ben interviewed, you'd get very different answers. Even more strangely is however that they never define evolution either. Its strange, because its like Steins argument isn't that evolution is wrong, faulty, have scientific problems...<br /><br />Its more that evolution is EVIL. It kills faith and it leads to bad things... which presents the craziest point of the movie: Evolution leads to Nazism. Which is just insane. It doesn't even deserve a comment.<br /><br />But I'll try to explain it because I understand that for some Christians they can't tell apart Socialdarwinism and Darwism. Thats actually very sad. Charles Darwin had NOTHING to do with socialdarwinism.<br />Just because natural selection seems to be the rule of the nature, where there is no moderating structures doesn't mean humans who can build a society any way we want have to apply natural selection into our way of living. Thats just sick minds. Hate socialdarwinism, but it has nothing to do with Darwin.<br /><br />And besides, socialdarwinism wasn't even the whole deal with Nazism. It was more complex than that. It was racial theories, it was strange religious stuff going on... and it was a cult of brainwashing and propaganda that took things too far and couldn't stop. It was a lot. Blaming Darwin for Hitler is as insane as blaming Newton for the Two Towers falling down, just because he discovered the theory of gravity.<br /><br />But as a positive note. The reason I give this 2 stars and not 1 is rather perhaps a bit of a sarcastic one, but still I'm sincere. I think this is excellent propaganda.<br />Even I, who knew almost every detail about the movie before I saw it, and knew a lot about the subject to logically refute the movie to bits.. was still moved by it somehow. Emotionally I was caught in it. And that impressed me. If I didn't know any better I'd probably be in favor of this movie as a serious documentary.<br /><br />Perhaps its because it kind of gave the illusion that evolution was destroying people's faith. It was destroying God. And it did present evolution as something rather awful. But this is of course all propaganda. Its a big seducing lie. Religious fundamentalists all over the globe has a new handy powertool now for brainwashing.<br /><br />This might even be filmhistorical propaganda, ready to be remembered as a school example of how manipulating the filmmedium can be to distort truth and promote lies, for all eternity.<br />Congratulations Ben Stein. You made history."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	So I originally ordered the fast and furious workout as I was kind of stuck and not able to go to the gym. I am/was a bit of a gym rat you could say, I went about 4 to 5 times a week and I am a full time working single mom of a 4 year old. After trying that workout I was amazed that I could not even come close to keeping up with it, so I ordered the Insanity workout as I love to be challenged.<br />I did consider myself to be in decent shape, I'm 33 and don't really need to lose more than a pound or two, but after the fast and furious workout I have realized how much better shape I could be in!<br />I've only really completed two days so this is slightly premature, but I already love it. My daughter loves watching me jump up and down too (the comment about my bottom jiggling funny was not needed!) and I think it's good for her to see mommy workout. Usually she sits in the gym daycare so this is a better option. I'm even going with the meal plan as I recently quit smoking and drinking alcohol entirely about a week ago. Why not get even healthier?<br />I will update this as time passes-I'm excited to see the results and fully committed to the program, in fact I am off to the store right now to get some new food and a decent mat to jump on!<br />And yes, you definitely sweat a lot. It's winter in Colorado, snowy outside, I have the heat off, window open and I am still dripping sweat haha!
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	Ahem  I'm going to break it down very simply for everyone out there.  Ready?  Good stories have a beginning, a middle, and an *END*.  They don't just stop 3/4 of the way through and roll credits.  I don't buy ANY of the excuses made for this (it mirrors real life, its part of the art, etc).  Its lazy.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Go, Ben Stein! His argument is logical, reasoned, and (pardon the language) intelligent. The negative assessments are laden with emotion and chary with reason. If ID is so absurd why fear its treatment in schools--unless refuting it is too difficult a challenge. If refuting Intelligent Design (ID) is difficult, present rational argument not emotional furor to put ID in its place. Most of the reviews seem content stating that evolution is good and ID is bad: those positions seem purely axiomatic; their tone, particularly rigid. Maybe Jonathan Swift was right: we're animals capable of reason; unfortunately we don't always make use of reason. Einstein seems to have been more open minded than Stein's critics. He developed a Theory of Relativity; he was openminded enough not to declare it an inextricable law.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	want a good laugh! gotta see this!!! jeff is so talented and absolutely HILARIOUS! a MUST see!!!
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	Well, I guess I waited too long to pick this title up.  None of the local big box stores had the Blu-ray release with a slip cover either.  Took a chance on amazon.com still having stock, but it seems they do not.  The release I received does have the 3 discs, just no slip cover.  However, at only 10 bucks, I can live with it until the super-ultra-cool-complete 8 movie set is released sometime in 2012...
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	I can't tell if this movie was poorly written or hacked to death during a Hollywood schedule crunch, but the end result is that the story line is botched and the characters completely unbelievable. There were so many times during the movie when I found myself shaking my head because of some ridiculous premise or character reaction. It's a shame, because I found a few of the ideas and graphics to be bordering on stunning. I hate long-winded reviews and the trite vocabulary lessons that accompany them, so I'll just close by saying that I was very disappointed with this film.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I have been using this for 6 weeks now and missed 1 workout. I have not lost any weight. I am 6'2"" 209Lbs and am very competive in everything I do. This is the toughest workout I have ever done. You work up a good sweat just in the warm-up alone. After that you still have 25-45 minutes of an ass kickin left.<br />I would only recommend this for anyone who will not give up. If you are the type who doesnt give it your all then more than likely you will not make it more than 1-2 weeks with this program. If you have knee/back problems this probly won't be for you. There is a lot of jumping up/down and just overall movement that will challenge your balance. Most of the balancing comes into play during the 2nd month. Either way good luck and I hope this helped."
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	Good movie just to kick back and enjoy for what it is. Just a fun picture and well done.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie makes you think about your relationsip and it doesn't matter if you are in a great relationship or a misserable one.  Everyone can learn from this movie
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Despite the bad reviews I have heard, I loved it.  I think this was a great representation of this fairytale.  I will probably watch it again.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	great product and transaction.  I have started the workout and the results are believable.  It is a hard workout, but if you go through it, it is enjoyable.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	"This 'documentary' is ridiculously bad. Truth? Bah, this has none of it. Consider the much better and accurate feature <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YY6VIC"">Judgment Day - Intelligent Design on Trial</a> instead."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I ordered both DVD and boy did I laugh till my sides hurt!! he is so funny and the newest guys are a real hit and if you don't like it, ""I kill you! "" as the bomber would say...LOL. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next, a female ""walter""?? The best part about the DVD, you have two verisons, clean (TV) or the adult (some parts not show on TV), Walter talks alot more about his sex life. If you want to laugh alot, then get busy and order it while supplies last at 20.00 for the set.<br />Jacqueline K. TEXAS"
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	The only review necessary for this dishonest dreck is to refer anyone who hasn't heard of the lies of Mark Mathis and Ben Stein to http://www.expelledexposed.com for the facts behind this disingenuously conceived and poorly executed pathetic piece of propaganda.
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	I was so looking forward to this movie. The commercials looked awesome. Unfortunately, the lack of a good script, terrible acting from Kristen Stewart, and funky, creepy dwarfs ruined it. There was no chemistry between Snow White and the huntsman - the characterization was glazed over at best. We're told Snow could inspire people to follow her, but why? Kristen Stewart does her usual fly-catching, mouth-open, blank-eyed gawping about - nothing about her portrayal of the character would inspire anyone to do anything but find something else to watch. I didn't expect or want silly dwarfs, but these guys were just dirty and creepy and weird, like little pedos. The huntsman had the most potential to be an interesting character, but his dialogue quickly ran out of steam. The evil queen and her brother were the best characters, but not enough to pull this stinker out of the hole. I would have been so happy if this was still a flawed but fun movie, but unfortunately, I couldn't wait for it to be over. A big disappointment.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Pixar movies are always good choice for all audiences. Great detail animation with strait message.  No need to be politically correct.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"One of God's ordinances for a marriage built according to His design is ""Husbands, love your wives as Christ also loved the church and gave His live for her.""  Fireproof is a marvellous illustration of the effectiveness of the first order of God's perfect wisdom for marriage, and how it can even work to restore a failing marriage."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Just wanted to say I am very satified with the promptness of my order.  The movie was as ordered and there was no problem at all with it.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I'm a little shocked, to say the least!<br />I kind of knew that that our food didn't come from the most clean or hygienic of places..but this?!<br />What bothers me most is the monopoly that these huge food companies have over our food productions and distribution.While I'm not the paranoid kind, I can see why such companies and use a stranglehold on us in dire situations.<br />While illegal immigration is not a valid point here...it does have implications in the long run. In Nebraska,Wisconsin and Iowa we do see large companies hire illegal aliens (exploiting them and bringing crime, poverty and complexity into this society).<br />Moral of the story for me:<br />I'm going to go a little more organic.<br />I'm going to question the way big business handles our food.<br />Thanks for such a great documentary.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This tape gives you a more personal view of our founding fathers (mainly John Adams but others as well)and what they went through to found this country.Every time you comlain about voting you should look at this DVD and see what others had to do to give you that privilege. Fantastic DVD.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Great movie from Ridley Scott and crew. Some people said it was not a prequel of Alien or it was not a prequel of Alien in a classical way. I saw it last night and it is absolutely a real prequel of Alien. As James Cameron did a fantastic sequel of Alien, Ridley Scott made of Prometheus a solid and polished film : huge huge huge sets, great photography, great music, a good script and very good acting. And the special effects and creatures are very detailed and realistic. At the last scene of the film, it migh suggest a sequel....who knows !!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS PRODUCT.<br />I REALLY LIKED THE MOVIE AND MY CHILDREN LIKED IT TOO!<br /><br />THANK YOU
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Love it!!  We never laughed so hard.  Give me more!!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This miniseries seems to be a powerful and realistic story of John Adam's life and career.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in American history and a look at the early days of our country.  The acting by the main characters is excellent.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"Sin City is definitely one of the must-see movies for this century, but be warned, this is not your regular kind of movie. If you want to see pedestrian, boring fantasy movie making, or trite, one-dimensional moralizing, stick to the horrendousness that is the Star Wars Prequels.<br /><br />Frank Miller's Sin City is far, far more than just a splatter-fest although it's got violence a-plenty.  If violence worries you at all, then DON'T GO.  However, if you can dig it, then I'll say this: the physical violence in this movie is deliberately cartoonish, and therefore much less psychically scarring than say ""Silence of the Lambs"".  There's other kinds of violence in Miller's creative work, however and on that I'll say more later.<br /><br />The movie is visually beautiful. It is _very_ much in keeping with Miller's graphic novels, but whilst  the graphic novels were completely black and white, Sin City the movie is actually super-saturated dark blues and grays. There is very little real black in the movie except Rosario Dawson's outfit  (what little there was of it anyway).<br /><br />This point has also been made before but it's worth saying again:  The movie is NOT meant to be realistic. This is the key to Frank Miller's whole visual style (of which more below).  If you like your movies literal and simpering then STAY AWAY from this movie. You won't like it, and you don't belong in the movie theater.<br /><br />As many, many other people have pointed out, the movie is _meant_  to be stylized, so the acting, the dialog and the visual style are all meant to be larger than life. Good grief. Have we become so blinkered, mentally-enslaved and unimaginative as a society that people can't even figure that out?  What stylization does is allow the ideas and emotional contours in the movie (and in Miller's graphic novels) to become more salient.  As with other non-realist forms of art, the deliberate break from naturalistic images allows us to see past the images to the ideas and feelings beneath them, and that's what a lot of people seem to have missed.<br /><br />On the subject of the acting, yes Mickey Rourke and Benicio did great jobs, but they also had the best lines.  I think the WOMEN in this movie acted their asses off, especially given the limited amount of talking they had.  What this meant was that a lot had to be conveyed by physical movement and facial expression.  Dawson did this wonderfully as Gail, the leader of the Second Amendment -hoisting prostitutes, and Jessica Alba did a pretty good job too although she hid way too much behind her  ""Little Nancy"" persona. This, I think, gave her much less to work with and so Alba's Nancy wasn't nearly as interesting a character as Dawson's Gail.  Personally I thought Devon Aoki's Miho was great.  No emoting, but then she wasn't supposed to. Before the movie came out, I had read some fan-boy stuff about how Zhang Ziyi would have been a better choice for Miho, but I don't think so.  Ms. Zhang is far too given to facial histrionics. Ms Aoki was perfect.  Also excellent was Brittany Murphey as Shellie the waitress, this was a spot-on casting decision, as Shellie has Murphey's Jersey Girl persona written all over her.<br /><br />Lastly, one of the defining themes in Miller's writing career from ""Batman: the Dark Knight Returns"", through ""Ronin"" and ""Daredevil"" to Sin City, is his profound contempt for the hypocrisy and self-servingness of those in authority.  Those who are attracted to order and paternal moralism will hate this movie because these are exactly the things that Miller has his characters take on.  One of the things that Sin City and Dark Knight share is the stark distinction between violence you do while doing the right thing and violence done while going along to get paid, or because you enjoy using your authority to prey on others. _This_ is the difference between the villains and the heroes in this movie.<br /><br />Violence then, in Miller and Rodriguez's world becomes a way for the dispossessed to reclaim their dignity and agency.  It's fantasy, it's id-laden but it's meant to be a work of fiction not a blue print for social justice.<br /><br />Note that Miller does not say that violence is 100% successful: Both Marv and Hartigan must die at the end of their respective vengeance quests.  In fact, the only male figure who survives is (interestingly) Dwight, the only guy who allies himself with powerful female characters (Rosario Dawson's Gail and Devon Aoki's Miho). Lone males, it seems, are more vulnerable than men and women working together.<br /><br />Miller's Sin City  is definitely less diverse and more androcentric than the Wachowskis' Matrix universe, but you don't have to be PC all the time to make a useful point.  Sure the prostitutes were all female, and sure this leaves the whole business of who the sex trade is set up for to one side. But the prostitutes in Sin City were independant workers, running their own society without male bosses and profiteers (a very far cry from the real-world sex trade, of course) and their independance is what they were fighting to protect.  For this reason, and because the real villains in this peice were all male. I think this is a far more complex movie than a lot of people want to think it is.  Skimpy outfits and sex work does not simply equate to misogyny.<br /><br />Go see this movie. It is a complex and compelling riff on morality, friendship, fighting city hall and (mostly) losing, getting old and getting by.  The delighted vengefulness which imbues this movie comes from nothing so much as our own outrage when the suits and their toadying minions stomp down on the rest of us: ""Kill him for me Marv. Kill him good."""
B004JMSIRC	1.0	b	After recently upgrading both my DVD players (a Samsung 1500 and a Pioneer BDP51) this disc will no longer play.  Interestingly not only will it not play, the Pioneer can't even identify it (unknown disc error).  Having invested in an HD home theater system I have to admit to being less than impressed with blu-ray.  Monthly firmware updates leading to a decreasing number of playable discs - sounds like a great system.  I'll stick with upsampling my DVDs.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Kristen Stewart gives notice that she is a screen presence---one that we are going to see in a lot more serious roles . The physicality of her role makes this a stunning performance . For a young woman to handle the final scene where she rallied the troops and then led them into battle is probably one of the most difficult things for an actress to do credibly. And she pulled it off with aplomb .
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	I watched this with an open mind. Unfortunately that is more than the creators of the film intended. The entire film is propaganda of the most shameful type.<br /><br />The vile attempt to link evolution with Hitler shows a complete lack of understanding of what evolution is and what it claimed. These types of character attacks are an attempt to hide the fact that there is no substance to the claims of an Intelligent Designer. The so called survivial of the fittest is actually the survival of the most stable and it has nothing to do with morality at all: a strand of DNA does not have any way of considering morality as it has no brain itself. It merely replicates itself.<br /><br />Applying the ideas of morality to any non-thinking item is pointless. Humans are the only animals that are capable of even considering the issue. Evolution is seen in all animals, whether self aware or not, and is also seen in plant life.<br /><br />I was really hoping to see an explanation of life different from evolution, with proper peer reviewed evidence: such a thing would turn the world up side down. However all I saw was yet another attempt to discredit over 100 years of peer reviewed work that started with Darwin.<br /><br />It seems as though the film makers were quite happy to mislead the public and the participants about the film and yet fail to see the irony of raising morality within it.<br /><br />The film is not just a waste of money: it is a waste of time and an affront to honour and integrity.
B008UBYTRG	3.0	b	"When I bought Spark of Insanity I had only seen Jeff Dunham's rendition of Ahmed the dead terrorist so it was all ""into the blue"" for me.<br />First off Jeff Dunham does a little stand-up comedy without his puppets and then lets them on stage one by one. Of course every one of them has their master's style in some way, but the way they act differs strongly, so that most people should find one or two charakters they really like (IF you like the creator's rough humor-> no great world politics but more making fun of your wife or your neighbour's car etc).<br />I liked watching it as light entertainment and one should not be expecting any more from this DVD.<br /><br />P.S.: The DVD is region free (watched it on a Region 2 player)."
B001KZG99A	2.0	b	Hype can work against anything that is mediocre. If it doesn't live up to the hype, it becomes a bigger disappointment than would have without the hype. This movie, Ironman, was just an ordinary action movie. Personally, there are too may holes in the plot to live up to Stan Lee's reputation. When you are expecting the detail and original ideas generated in comics or graphic novels you know that plot lines and details really matter. This movie didn't live up to hype or the methods they could have used to tell this story.<br /><br />As Marvel's first major production movie it was just OK. Again, I was expecting to be told a story of Tony Stark, Stark Enterprises, Obediah, Pepper and war, that's what I got. However, with the wealth of truly original story lines and material generated over 30 years of Ironman I expected the story to move and excite me. It didn't. I think they took pains to make Tony Stark and the birth of this franchise believable and that made the first 25 minutes slow.<br /><br />There are many different time lines and plot development techniques that could have been employed here. Instead it was a straight forward and unfortunately, generic version of Ironman. I had thought that with all the complaining Marvel did when the big studio's did, Spiderman(s), Daredevil, Ghostrider, The Fantastic 4(s), The Punisher and X-Men that they themselves would have learned that it is not just a movie; these are legends. These stories should be treated like the campfire legends of history. But instead, we got a movie that spent too much time laying the ground work to become the Ironman franchise.<br /><br />In my opinion Jon Favreau did a great job, Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job, and although I didn't agree at first, Jeff Bridges did an excellent job as well. They just had a Ho-Hum script to work with. I would suggest sending the screenplay writers to Pakistan for some more research.<br /><br />Edited on October 11, 08:  At first I was very disappointed with the movie, even regretted purchasing it.  Now I have watched it 2 more times and I have actually enjoyed it more each time.  The Blue Ray 2nd disc is really interesting with an entire breakdown of the process from set location to casting, all the way to title graphics and sound editing.  If you like to see how movies are made this is one of the better bonus discs I have seen.  For the action, thriller, buff it is actually more like a 3 star to 4 star movie.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I'm a huge trueblood fan of this show and so naturally, I had to get the season 1 dvd's to watch whenever I want. I'm watching them all through right now and probably will do so a million times... This would be a great gift for anyone who enjoys this suspensful adult show!
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	The dvd was wonderful, full of the comedy I've come to expect from Jeff.The only place I found fault was in a couple of the special features, they just were not my taste in comedy. So to anyone thinking of getting this dvd, please do so, its wonderful.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	I just finished watching Prometheus and I must say dispite all the mixed reviews, I found it to be a wonder to behold. Not only is it in 3-D but it's deep also meaning it is very thought provoking. The acting was great and most of the scenes and action were spectacular. This is what movies should be.<br /><br />When I was younger there was a film called 2001 A Space Odyssey and in order to fully enjoy and understand it, you should see it more than once and I feel this movie also falls into that category, even for me. My suggestion is, have a seat,turn out the lights, pay close attention, and enjoy.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"Ok, I'm hooked!  At first I was a little uncertain with all the sex stuff and language, but after the second episode who notices all that.  This is really a fun series to watch (so much that I had to order HBO for season 2).  My daughter thinks Eric is the best.  I see a lot of the ""other series"" here, but we are hooked on that too."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie is awesome. It is definite must to watch if your marriage is having its ups and downs. Great tips!!!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	This was a xmas gift. Ordered Nov 28 and it arrived Dec 2. Product in excellent shape and as described.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	We had seen this special on Comedy Central.  I haven't laughed that hard in a very long time!  I went straight to the computer and ordered and of course Amazon had a GREAT price.  We were laughing again before the week was over!
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	I thought 'Hey, the guy who plays Thor is in it... maybe it will be good.' But I was wrong, this movie had such a big budget and does not deserve any of the money it makes back. The only watchable character is the guy from Thor, then rest of the actors almost didnt need to even be there. Someone could have filmed the queens character pacing the halls of her castle for two hours and the movie would have made just as much sense. Save your money and buy something that is actually quality, and not just a bunch of odds and ends of special effects thrown together. This movie gets two thumbs jammed into my eyes so that I never have to see this crap again.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	HBO's miniseries of John Adams are absolutely mesmerizing!  You don't need to be a history buff to enjoy this DVD. Beautiful cinematography, costumes, and fine acting by Paul Giamatti (I want to watch Sideways again!) and equally talented Laura Linney, the series will take you back in time to our founding fathers' struggle to create a new nation.  Directed by Tom Hooper (Elizabeth I), along with the music score by Joseph Vitarelli and Robert Lane, the series will take you on a amazing, magical journey. Now, I don't know how accurate the movie is to the actual event.  For that I will read David McCullough's book --- all 651 pages of it!  As far as the DVD goes, however, this one is a keeper.  Thanks, Amazon.com!
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater.  It has great action, a good cast, and cool special effects.  I was glad to add it to my dvd collection.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan, when I initially saw the preview for this movie I was so excited. Keeping with the way he directed &quot;Signs&quot; this movie was much like that, its obvious they were done by the same director, there are some similiaries.<br /><br /> The idea for this movie was an interesting, unique one and pulled off well, however, there was a surprise twist (like all Shyamalan movies have) that took the movie in the wrong direction. If Shyamalan had left the twist out of the loop the movie would have been much better.<br /><br /> Not as edge of your seat as his other movies, it wasn't as special as I had hoped it would be. My advice, wait for the DVD version...
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	The filmmakers had to make some tough choices in deciding what  to include when adapting the lengthy ORDER OF THE PHOENIX for the movies and for the most part they have done a great job.  The sequence where Mr. Weasley is attacked seems a bit rushed and if I hadn't read the book I might not have understood what was happening there.  I also would have liked to have seen Neville visiting his parents at St. Mungo's though that might have been too poignant of a scene for this all ready quite dark movie and the Longbottoms's situation is discussed.  One of the greatest pleasures of this series is seeing the child actors  growing up from kids to teenagers and all the major players both teens and adults  do a great job.  Imelda Staunton is comically loathsome as Dolores Umbridge and I think we've all known her slightly less exaggerated counterparts in the muggle world. I've always been a fan of both Helena Bonham-Carter and Emma Thompson each now in  middle age and wonderful in character parts in this film as the evil deranged witch Bellatrix and the hapless divination teacher Sybil Trelawney respectively.  As in all the previous Potter movies special acting honors should go to Alan Rickman for playing so well the complex and enigmatic Snape.  And the set and special effects look absolutely spectacular on the screen.  One caution the dementors in the opening scene, Harry's visions and the battle scenes are all very intense so think carefully about taking kids under ten.
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	"The guys over at Pixar must be drinking some really good stuff.  It seems that no matter what ideas that they come up with, they always manage to make a great film out of them.  ""Cars"" is a prime example of that.  When I first saw the trailers for this ""vehicle,"" I have to admit that I had absolutely no interest in this film.  However, my daughter wanted to see it with one of her friends and I, along with my wife and my daughter's friend's mother and brother, headed out to see ""Cars.""  It was wonderful.  Granted, it isn't as good as some of Pixar's other efforts, but it suffices as a family comedy that everyone can watch together.<br /><br />Much like ""A Bug's Life"" and ""The Incredibles,"" ""Cars"" relies heavily on good-natured comedy to plug its message into the audience.  The story starts off with a race that's being lead by hotshot rookie, Lightning McQueen, eternal runner-up, Chick Hicks, and the elder racer on his way out, The King.  After the race ends in a three-way tie, it's decided that a race will be held in California to determine the winner of the Piston Cup.  McQueen, voiced by Owen Wilson, is determined to get to California first and pushes his Mack truck, voiced by Pixar staple, John Ratzenberger, to drive on through the night to get there.  Of course, Mack falls asleep and McQueen is accidentally dumped in the middle of nowhere, a nice little town called Radiator Springs.<br /><br />Once there, McQueen is introduced to a kaleidoscope of funny characters voiced by the likes of another Pixar staple, Bonnie Hunt, Paul Newman, Cheech Marin, George Carlin, and Tony Shalhoub.  Larry the Cable Guy, who's the least funny of the ""Blue Collar"" guys in my opinion, makes this flick worth it for youngsters.  He supplies the bulk of the comedy for the kiddos.  Other voices that some, especially race fans, might pick out are Richard Petty (The King), Dale, Jr. as Junior, Mario Andretti as himself, and others such as Bob Costas, Katherine Helmond, and Michael Keaton.<br /><br />While in Radiator Springs, McQueen learns that it isn't always the person who comes in first or has the most bobbleheads of themselves that makes them happy.  It's just being in the place you need to be no matter what the circumstances.<br /><br />The story does run a bit long for a film focused primarily on children, and it doesn't hold up as well as the last long Pixar flick, ""The Incredibles.""  However, there's just enough laughs and in-jokes for parents and kids to make it through.  This isn't one of Pixar's best films, but it's still a fine addition to their catalogue.<br /><br />Highly recommended to families, especially if you have race fans in yours.  Pixar was perfect in capturing the thrill of a race, with great angles on all the racing action."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	We almost peed our pants. We kept forgetting the dummies were not real. He is that good.<br /><br />Loved it.
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	"Within the first few minutes of watching the acting, I had a feeling I would not enjoy this movie. The script sounded cheesy. A little girl talks about wanting to marry her dad (really???). Then, the actors appear, and the acting is just as horrible. I can't believe any director would settle for this...<br /><br />The couple argues frivolously like children, and it got old very soon. Their feuds seemed strained and fake. (Honey the door needs painting, but you won't...!; I'm saving for a fishing boat!; The lawn needs landscaping!; I've been saving for my boat for years!) The accents are too strong (""thick"") also for most of the characters.<br /><br />Then comes the bit about the firefighters asking questions about heaven and hell, which I thought was odd. Then the father of the immature husband who can't handle his marriage suggests his son turn to the Lard to save his marriage, and then a 13-ft cross comes center screen as they're walking through a forest. The father says he used to be like his son, yada yada yada, then it became clear to me that a major theme of the movie is...surprise, faith in Jebus and the Father and Mother Nature, whatever.<br /><br />Very, very poor acting. Full of clich&eacute;s (sweet tea with lemon - surprise - for our Georgia natives, might as well have had peaches!) and tired, boring drama pressed hard by the actors by yelling the best they can at each other for what seems like their debut on camera. On a positive note, the picture looks crystal clear, which I suppose it worth the star I've at least got to rate this film."
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	"Imagine yourself down on your knees, licking the floor of a men's bathroom at a gas station two miles off the interstate at 3 a.m. on a Sunday morning. That would be a gourmet meal compared to what I had to stomach to sit through the first two episodes of ""True Blood.""  Even to last that long took a fair amount of willpower, but I forced myself to keep watching because part of me couldn't believe a really popular t.v. show could be that vile.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, or lack an edgy sense of humor. But personally I think it means that there's a limit as to how much gratuitous brutality I'm able to tolerate in the name of being entertained.  And that includes the ugly, cheap sex that permeates this series, and which appears to be the underlying reason for all the vampire brouhaha surrounding the sex scenes.<br /><br />The basic premise of the show is clever: a world where an oppressed vampire minority has ""come out of the closet,"" because the invention of artificial blood has eliminated the need for them to hunt humans.  Still, vampires have to deal with their fundamental difference from humans, as well as eons of societal prejudice against them.  Then there's a young human woman whose ability to read minds and other traits make her sympathetic to the vampire cause.  Add a large dose of the sexual attraction that is always part of vampire lore.  This could make for interesting drama in the hands of an imaginative writer.  It's not vampires I find objectionable.  It's ""True Blood"" I find objectionable.<br /><br />Some reviewers have noted that the series is based on books that are better than the show, which is usually the case when books are adapted for the screen. Be that as it may, I saw only offensive stereotypes of Southerners; relentless gore; sex that was more pornographic than erotic; viciousness; and an ongoing series of visual images that left me feeling like I wished I'd been wearing a Haz Mat suit.<br /><br />Consider this review a public service for any other old-fashioned, out-of-touch people who, like me, hadn't paid attention to the show and were curious about it.  It's a warning that some things are bad for your mind and your spirit and best left untouched, even with a 10-foot pole."
B001684L0A	1.0	b	You would think when buying new copies of products that when you opened it it wouldn't have a giant scratch. Well, that happened to my John Adams DVD set. I would suggest just going out and buying it, because you never know if you're going to get a DVD set that you can barely play.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />A Pissed-Off Customer

B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I was a little lost at the end after seeing it at the theater, but watching it on DVD cleared up all my confusion. There's a lot of detail which can be a bit tricky the 1st time around. Having said that, it really is an excellent and engrossing and entertaining movie. All the actors did a great job - especially Leo & Damon. I usually can't stand Nicholson's hambone emoting but he was good in this part. His character was a composite of gang bosses Whitey Bulger, Jimmy Coonan and Joe Massino. Like I said, all the plot twists & turns & the details were somewhat hard to follow at 1st, but watch it again & it all makes perfect sense.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	"This is a ""grown-up"" version of the Snow White fairy tale we have all heard many times before.  Dark and gritty, the queen exhibits pure evil, though you develop a little sympathy for her by the end (just as Snow White does).  The costumes and effects are great, and Hemsworth once again proves he is an action star to watch.  This isn't your children's fable, but definitely one older teens and adults can get into, particularly if you enjoy films of action and the fantasy/sci-fi genre."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	'No Country' is the one McCarthy novel that did not leap from the page. The Cohen's treatment of it, however, is an entirely different matter and surely would please the author. The dark and violent theme is perfectly realised without distracting moralizing. No doubt the Cohens feasted with the script's permission to express the gore, the blood spill, the power of weaponry and splintered bone.The balance between Bardem's implaccable evil, Jone's diminished and despairing Lawman, and the resourceful Brolin is held in unrelenting tension through 'til the credit roll. Jones has come into his own as a wise elder over the last few years and to date, this is his finest role...the lip pouts, shrugs, eyes worn into wincing wrinkles, all understated to dignify the film. He is granted the opening and closing words of the narrative but has no control over the unfolding mayhem. It's an exemplary performance, the one amongst the three leads which possesses some creditable psychological depth. Barden's automatonic stance might have dwindled to caricature but for the calm intelligence he brings to his repartee. Where does this fit in the Cohen's canon? With 'Blood Simple', 'The Big Lebowski' and,'Fargo'. They are back on the money, finding in the South-West, like McCarthy, a stage large enough to enact the dubious bloodfest that seems endemic to the culture.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie is a lot of fun for all ages. I especially enjoy the surround sound which is actually 6.1 DD-EX - most movies are only released in 5.1 DD...
B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	"This documentary brings up some good points about the scientific community and its state of stifling scientific questioning and growth. Any ""true"" scientist would not ascribe so adamantly to the belief NOR the disbelief in God because simply put there is NO evidence for OR against a God's existence. The fact that these scientist even vocalize their staunch disbelief in God while addressing scientific issues makes them hypocrites whom would chastise others for letting their belief in God cloud their scientific judgement. Letting your DISbelief in something rule your judgment is no different than letting your belief do the same thing...anyway...I'm glad this is out there to bring light to this reality, because yes this IS actually happening. You are a laughing stock if you even dream of diverging from the evolution point of view. The world is flat, the world is flat, the world is flat..."
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	"I have been wanting to see this show for a while now.  I do not get HBO so I haven't had the chance to watch any of the episodes.  I have read every book in the series, which I loved.  I found that the show is not at all like the books, and it had way more ""R"" factor than I expected.  A few of the story lines drag in the middle of certain episodes.  If you are a fan of the books and think a tv show would be awesome, I would recommend skipping it.  However, if you are open to a loose interpretation of characters and events from the books, the show is well put together.  Actors and actresses are talented.  The writing and directing are not bad.  Could have been better, but that's usually how it goes."
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	"The Award for best movie 2007 went to Scorsese for The Departed .  Although I enjoyed some of the performances, lead by Leo...Jack...Marky Mark et cetera...., I felt the movie lacked that Scorsese flare that we are all so used to.<br /><br />Being from BOSTON myself, I'm quite aware of the Bulger case, and this is NOT it.  The DVD would have you think so, but The Departed is really based off of the 1st film in the trilogy, ""Infernal Affairs."" This is why I am forced to give this Scorsese film a 3."
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"This lavish, entertaining fantasy adaptation of Grimms' fairy tale from first-time feature director Rupert Sanders is a huge upgrade from the frivolous Julia Roberts film ""Mirror, Mirror.""<br /><br />Kristen Stewart is Snow in this dark, compelling version fashioned by writers Evan Daugherty, John Lee Hancock and Hossein Amini. In their decidedly serious take on the subject, Snow's father is murdered by her new stepmother (Charlize Theron), who promptly imprisons his daughter until she's able to break free and seek refuge in the dark forest. Needing her back, alive, Theron's Queen sends a washed-up huntsman (""Thor""'s Chris Hemsworth) after her, though he questions her motivations -- as well as his own -- after he runs into the young heroine.<br /><br />Happily eschewing the CGI'd green-screen approach of so many other, recent genre films, ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" benefits enormously from its real-world UK location shooting. The film looks like an actual, lived-in environment, and its ""realistic"" visuals are matched by equally strong performances, especially from Theron (in one of her juiciest roles) and Hemsworth, who does some nice work in a scene with the cursed Snow late in the film. For her part, Stewart does as much with the character of Snow White as the script allows - I bought her in Snow's empathetic scenes with the natural world, but she doesn't really have much to do in comparison with the other leads. There are also the dwarves, here played by a collection of character actors CGI'd to smaller proportions (Bob Hoskins, Ian McShane and Ray Winstone among them), but the film doesn't do nearly enough with that concept as it should have.<br /><br />The plot itself is surprisingly rich and traditional - not in terms of it being a fairy tale, but rather an old-fashioned cinematic fantasy-adventure - and is backed by impressive cinematography, costumes, and a satisfying mix of character and action. Sanders draws you in and lets the film breathe, and while there are CGI beasts, the film's emotional draw is human - rather than technical - in nature, and ends on a particularly satisfying beat (with a robust James Newton Howard score). Even more satisfying than the likes of ""Willow"" and ""Dragonslayer,"" this ""Snow White"" is a surprisingly good ""revisionist"" take of the oft-told tale on nearly every level.<br /><br />Universal brings ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" to Blu-Ray on September 11th in a combo pack featuring both the theatrical version and a slightly extended, 132-minute unrated cut. Extra features are fairly light - just a few making Of featurettes and commentary are on-hand - but the transfer (1080p AVC) is terrific, as is the DTS MA audio. A DVD and digital copy (both Ultraviolet and standard itunes-variety) are also included."

B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"First I must tell the editor who wrote the review that I personally don't think any Latin guy who understands English will not laugh his guts out watching this. I was born in Cuba, and I am way beyond that ""politically correct cr@@p"". Although I would suggest one thing: next time any guy out there talks about us Cubans, please remember two things: 1) No, we DO NOT consume chili, jalapenos or whatever (that is a MEXICAN custom, not Cuban) and 2) We have no idea back in Cuba what a taco is. In fact, that for us, means a completely different thing; and a tortilla for us is an omelet, not some floury thing that, by the way, we again DO NOT know anything about back there. But then, enough of that, and let's give a huge round of applause for this guy. He is simply BRILLIANT. And for those of you Latin guys who go: ""Oh this is wrong, politically incorrect.."" I would say, get a freaking life!!!"
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	"This movie had a few things going for it at the beginning.  I won't go into details for any who haven't seen it, but it started out with an interesting plot and intriguing characters.  You'll hear alot about great cinematography, editing, etc. and I can also agree to these points.<br /><br />The problem with the film really happens about two thirds of the way through.  A certain event traspires which completely rips the viewer out of the story and forces them to instead watch what amounts to a glorified and completely unresolved murder spree.  The narrative is totally derailed at this point in the movie and all that is left is a feeling of disgust (and maybe depression if movies can get to you that way).<br /><br />I've heard arguments that the ""derailment"" is a realistic situation which is much more true to life than would have been a more traditional continuation of the storyline.  I can't argue with that, but if the film makers were going for realism, they sure didn't maintain that plan throughout film production.  The bad guy, though well acted and interesting, doesn't contain a shred of realism in his entire makeup.  From a skewed ""code of honor"" to downright laughable weapons of choice to Stallone-like pain tolerance, this guy is a poster boy for the triumph of Hollywood entertainment over realism.  I wouldn't normally knock this artistic decision since I appreciate a good Hollywood formula as much as the next guy, I simply find it humorous that ""realism"" is a buzzword for so many of this film's admirers.<br /><br />I think much of this movie's popularity comes from the Oscar buzz which surrounded it as soon as it was released.  The Coens did a great job of marketing this as ""new"" and ""innovative"" to get the buzz going, which of course leaves alot of folks unwilling to admit they didn't ""get"" the movie...and therefore they follow along and claim it was ""genious"".<br /><br />I would have considered giving this DVD release 2 stars if it had come with a ""No Tommy Lee Jones"" cut included.  As much as I enjoyed his performance (best in the movie) his character had absolutely NO impact on the events of the story and you would honestly miss nothing if his scenes were cut.  At least then you could say you saw the movie...and save yourself 20 minutes or so in the bargain, not to mention missing his rambling and pointless speech at the end of the movie.  Yes...if you do watch this trainwreck, Tommy Lee's speech does signal the end of the movie...you will get no more answers...you are expected to listen intently to this speech to decipher the point the movie has been trying to get across.  Don't worry if you doze off or zone out and miss the gist of his speech...plenty of this film's fans did the same thing and had to go back and watch it again.  I guess that simple fact should do a better job of NOT recommending a movie than I ever could."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Spark of Insanity is even better than the Arguing With Myself DVD. You gotta love Walter, Peanut, Jose Jalapeno and the new addition called Achmed, the Dead Terrorist. Jeff gets so much personailty out of these puppets using only his voice and movements of his hand. It's amazing to watch him bring these wacky characters to life. There is some adult subject matter and a little foul language, so watch it before showing your kids, but it really has no more than most PG-13 movies. This would make a great gift for just about anyone. Heck, why not also make it a gift for yourself? Take some time out of your busy life and get ready to laugh until you have a headache. I'm sure you deserve it. The laughter, not the headache.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	The Coen's hit this one way out of the park. Brilliantly directed, acted, and filmed, but obviously not for the dull-witted masses.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	"M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few directors working in Hollywood who truly has talent and respect for his craft as evidenced by his masterful films ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", films with ingenious scripts and sublime yet subdued direction. Alas, ""The Village"" is not on par with these films, not by far. Shyamalan was already begining to falter with his previous film ""Signs"" which miscast Mel Gibson in a serious role way above his dramatic abilities and which had a tone that wavered between pretentious and hammy (and let's not even mention the twist ending of that movie). ""The Village"" is even worse than ""Signs"" as it is a film that is overly pretentious, bland, po-faced and above all, handled with a hand so heavy that the film is crushed under its weight. The story about a secluded community in Pennsylvania in the 19th century which begins to experience terrifying trespasses from mysterious creatures who live in the surrounding woods, is simple and at first, intriguing. But the stilted dialogue, portentous tone and crawling pace, deaden every inch of luster out of the premise, and to make matters worse, the plot takes a harrowingly stupid turn at the end that renders the whole film pointless and ridiculously self-important. With bland performances from an all star cast, Shyamalan's pretentious handling and a twist at the end that is so ludicrous it is almost insulting, the film is a mess from beginning to end, which is something that is very painful to experience especially knowing what Shyamalan is capable of in terms of pure cinematic genius. Disappointing to say the least."
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Very surprised by how good this turned out.  I had low expectations, but they pulled it off brilliantly!  I enjoyed the re-telling of the classic fairytale.  Great effects, and good music!
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	"I saw this movie recently and felt I should make a review to share with people who has seen the movie or for  people who want to see the movie and want to get a perspective of it at first.<br /><br />First the only snow white in the movie is the 1. Mirror 2. A Dead King 3. The Idea of a Stepmother who wants Snow White dead. That is it, no more, I do not understand why they simply didn't make something else, the fair princess who is in a total mess and everything around her will suffer till she meets 7 gnomes? yes not dwarfs and who apparently is followed by Thor who is lost in it's character and chased by a looney albino ???<br /><br />Seriously WTH is this, not only the main character who was supposed to be Snow White who by definition , was as white as snow, hair as dark as night and have red lips as red as... and whose beauty surpassed everyone else even the ""queen"" ok that fails, the girls is not white, the hair is ok black the lips are idk what and she is not breathtaking.<br /><br />The story then falls into LOTR then turns into fairy land and comes back to WTH... I mean really whoever wrote this was on something, then the persons who thought of the main characters and their roles, shared the something the first guys inhaled, and the casting person was clueless.<br /><br />Over all go see Mirror Mirror it's dumb but at least funnier and entertaining.  whoever gave this movie 5 or 4 starts is entertained with plain crap."
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Coming in to ""The Departed"", I was lucky to already know what the plot was about (some trailers are so obscure as to not mention anything about the plot, to hide the fact that it sucks) and it got four stars (highest rating) in my local newspaper's movie reviews, with lots of great mention on acting and drama and directing.<br /><br />The movie was very well-done. It was a bit confusing in the start as some of the actors mumbled and made it hard to understand them, but this didn't deter from the plot as though you missed something important. The directing style wasn't too special at first, but showed some definite high points and strengths later on (the scene where Martin Sheen's character, chief Queenan, is thrown from the roof of a building in slow motion, a bunch of people in the theater I was in gasped audibly, and even more so when he hit the ground)<br /><br />The acting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, not just in the movie, but in their roles as rats, were very convincing (some scenes with DiCaprio, and Frank Costello suspecting him as the rat, made me genuinely think he wasn't a rat, but rather pretending to be one.)<br /><br />The dialog is crisp and never seems to falter with uselessness or insanity or something off the wall completely. My only complaints were that Matt Damon's character Colin Sullivan had some unexplained obsession with the golden dome roof of a church, in which he'd constantly stare at in his apartment. This was never explained or even delved into in the least. Another was the mild hint at Costello slowly going crazy over the course of the movie. I didn't see this at all. He did some eccentric things in the later course, but nothing to truly qualify as ascending derangement.<br /><br />The movie peaked when the two rats discovered each other out (after Costello's death) and DiCaprio's character William Costigan went out trying to expose him, even going so far as to lure him into a trap and trying to arrest him, despite not being a cop (his identity was erased for secrecy reasons during his mission, which only the police chief who was killed knew, and the Sergeant played by Mark Wahlberg, Seargent Dignam, who left the police force rather than hand over the identity of their rat in Costello's group).<br /><br />It all seemed to go downhill from here as Billy Costigan is killed by an officer who was revealed to be a second rat working for Costello, who then let Sullivan go. He then killed one of the officers who was friends with DiCaprio's character, and then was killed by Sullivan. Then he went home, to discover Dignam there, who then killed him and wandered off.<br /><br />The final scene is that of Sullivan's balcony, with a view of the golden dome church, and a rat on the banister sniffing something. For some reason, this ending left me unfulfilled, and a bit disappointing, almost anti-climactic for a movie which was building up so much intensity, complexity, and drama."

B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"With many of today's movies portraying and glorifying adultery and divorce, this movie is a breath of fresh air.  It is about a fireman whose marriage is about to end in divorce.  He treats his wife coldly and selfishly, traits that his wife also exhibits towards him.  Just as he is about to resort to a divorce, the young man's father offers help in the form of ""The Love Dare"", a 40-day program for restoring struggling marriages.  At first he is reluctant, but eventually he finds new faith in the Lord and his wife begins to realize that he is a changed man.  Besides Kirk Cameron in the lead role, most of the other actors are amateurs and they do an amazing job.  The movie has its comic relief, such as the young couple's laconic next-door neighbors, and is overall the most polished effort to date from its producers.  This movie is not just meant for entertainment, but is very instructive about how people should live their lives and conduct their marriages."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"In the stylish new Coen Brothers' movie, ""No Country for Old Men,"" the violence is both graphic and coy, both in-your-face and strangely demur in the way it is portrayed.  Bit players are frequently blown away in full view of the audience, while key characters often meet their ends off screen, away from the spotlight of the prying camera.  For this is the theme of the movie, that violence is arbitrary, capricious and unpredictable, and that things are only going to get worse in a culture that has grown increasingly coarse and indifferent to human suffering over the years.<br /><br />The ""old man"" of the title is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a small town Texas sheriff who, right on the verge of retirement, has seen a depressing spike in violent crime thanks to the recent proliferation of drug-running from Mexico (the movie takes place in 1980).  For this is a ""new time"" in America, one in which an all-out criminal ""war"" is being fought, as much on the open plains as in the crowded cities.  It is the ""old men"" like Bell, the last in a long line of old style Texas lawmen, who can no longer recognize their country and who are left to recede into the background bewildered and frustrated by their inability to do anything about it.<br /><br />As the story opens, a group of men lie dead in a windswept field, victims of a drug deal gone terribly awry.  The perpetrator is a psychopath by the name of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is now wandering the countryside on a random killing spree, dispatching human victims as casually as the rest of us would a mosquito or fly.  Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a ""retired"" welder  who stumbles upon not only the carnage-strewn scene but a suitcase filled with millions of dollars in unmarked bills.  When Moss makes the fatal mistake of taking the loot, he becomes the prime target of Chigurh, who will stop at nothing to get what is rightfully his.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, ""No Country For Old Men"" is less notable for its story and characters than for its cinematic naturalism and impressionistic style.  Despite having made some truly exceptional films in the past, Joel and Ethan Coen have never been as thoroughly in control of their medium or as supremely confident in their filmmaking as they are here.  The first hour, in particular, is such a flawless masterpiece of composition and tone that it will probably be studied as a model in film school courses for years to come.  Not since the films of Terrance Malick has landscape been used to more brilliant effect than in the opening section of this work.  The setting - so brilliantly captured in Roger Deakins' incisive cinematography and Craig Berkey`s stunning sound design - becomes a palpable presence in its own right and a key player in the drama.  The Coens have done their own editing on the film, which explains why the pacing feels like an exquisitely honed piece of music, built on finely calibrated beats and rests, meter and rhythm.  The hypnotic, dreamlike quality of the filmmaking carries the story into the realm of archetype and myth which matches perfectly the surrealistic nature of the piece.<br /><br />Bardem provides a bone-chilling portrait of a human killing-machine whose sole purpose in life is to destroy that which gets in his way (not that he doesn't enjoy killing just for the sheer pleasure of it as well).  In Bardem's hands, Chigurh becomes the true incarnation of evil in its darkest form.  Jones brings a world-weary gravity to the role of the sheriff, while Brolin, who gets the majority of the screen time in the film, does some of the best work of his career as the man desperate to keep one step ahead of his pursuer.<br /><br />Perhaps predictably, the movie is not able to sustain the same level of greatness all the way through its running time and there are moments when the filmmakers seem to lose their way somewhat (particularly when Woody Harrelson shows up as a comic-relief bounty hunter).  The unresolved ending may frustrate those who don't like any loose ends hanging around at the end of a story, but the inconclusiveness of the conclusion actually adds to the verisimilitude of the movie quite a bit.<br /><br />Still, even if the movie falters a bit towards the end, there's no denying that ""No Country For Old Men"" is one of the outstanding films of recent times.  In fact, that first hour or so is about as close to perfection as filmmaking is ever likely to get."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"Every time Martin Scorsese releases a movie, the world waits breathlessly for the next ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" or ""Goodfellas."" It's not easy, however, to craft a film of such enduring appeal. While I love ""The Departed"" (it won Scorsese that elusive Best Director Oscar), I certainly don't consider it to be his best work. It's a vastly entertaining tale based on Hong Kong's ""Infernal Affairs"" that brings back a life and passion absent from some of his other recent efforts. Brasher and more viscerally exciting than ""The Aviator,"" more coherent and intelligent than ""Gangs of New York, this does remind you of the pictures made on the mean streets of Scorsese's earlier classics. But while the film is abundantly entertaining, thrilling and twisty, it is not without flaws either.<br /><br />First, the good. It's a terrific plot that is well executed, complicated and morally ambiguous. You can't help but be impressed with the layer upon layer of complexity as our characters live in worlds that are based on lies. How do you maintain the essence of yourself when you exist in a state of pretense? How to you survive and thrive when one mistake could mean your life? There are knotty ethical issues to be wrestled with throughout the picture--a lot more for the viewer to think about and contemplate than in your traditional action fare.<br /><br />Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio give fully realized, dynamic performances. It may be a career high for both actors. I appreciated their immersion into these men. They are bold and challenging portraits of two people trapped within situations that now define them. Free choice is limited and you can't play by the rules. Ruthlessness and dishonesty become necessary to survive, their lives parallel beautifully even though they are at odds. Nice characterizations from Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen are highlights as well. Wahlberg, in particular, has rarely been so alive on the screen.<br /><br />One element in the film that has been debated is Jack Nicholson's performance, however. Either you think it is a brilliant Jack Nicholson role or you wish for a little more restraint. Well, I almost always wish for some restraint with modern Nicholson (aside form the nicely nuanced role in ""About Schmidt""). Here, though, his over-the-top portrait actually serves the film well. I enjoyed his antics and it worked as a suitable counterpoint to the younger performers.<br /><br />The one element of the film I really struggled with, however, is the female character. Played by Vera Farmiga, she is more of a plot convenience than a real asset to the film. Awkwardly and unbelievably positioned between Damon and DiCaprio, she does little to heighten the drama. It's a huge suspension of belief to put her into the middle of things and with only an unnecessary romantic subplot to show for it, it just isn't worth it. It's not Farmiga's fault, but the film came to a screeching halt every time she entered into it (especially her absurd doctor/patient interactions with DiCaprio). I definitely recommend ""The Departed,"" though, for sheer entertainment purposes it is close to a great film. 4 1/2 stars. KGHarris, 11/06."
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I have enjoyed this entry in the Harry Potter series as I have those previously. I enjoyed it even more knowing that I paid much less then the local advertised price.
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	I decided to minimize playback issues related to servers and Internet connections and downloaded the entire movie first.  Sure, no skipping or halts.  However, even hooked up to an HDTV via HDMI, the resolution was terrible, and tons of shadowboxing, ghosting, and pixelation.  And I don't know if it was how the movie was shot, but the lighting and backdrop colors were HORRIBLE.  Either the scenes were too bright or the skies were some weird, bright pastel color.<br /><br />This is the first and last time I bother doing a VOD rental.  I'll stick to renting the actual disc.  Glad I didn't pay a thing for it as I had a promotional credit.<br /><br />OBTW, the movie was okay - still say Prisoner of Azkaban was the absolute best.  Not exactly a fun diversion - I think I chuckled once or twice.  It was all dread, sorrow, anger, and angst the rest of the time.  The big problem with splitting it up in to two movies - it's all lead up, no resolution.  Makes you think they should only charge half the price?
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"This is the first movie I've seen with Stewart.  What is wrong with her?  Does she always act in this manner, or was she preoccupied with her affair?  The few words she spoke, she stated them worse than when someone reads aloud from a book.  Her ""fighting"" speech - she just yelled the words out.  Huh?!  Has she no experience in human suffering, that she can not remotely fathom what it would be like to be locked in an underground prison cell for so many years, to lose both parents, to see the depths of sorrow in her kingdom?... so that she can not bring these emotions to her acting?<br /><br />And what was happening with the last scene (coronation scene)?  Why was she just standing there & almost pretending to have a 'climax' ???<br /><br />The Queen & the Huntsman were great.  The scenery was beautiful, the effects (ok, except for that one scene) worked well.  But .... the main character is a joke......!!!"
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	Ironman is right up there with the other heroes. Yet he seems closer to being human than the others. Maybe it's his clumsiness? Whatever the case Robert Downey Jr. did a great job. Now for the movie....yes its funny and something for the entire family but could use a little more depth. Afterall Spidey and Batman have some serious issues brewing (criterion/prerequisite for being a superhero). Perhaps we could see that in Ironman 2? Sometimes you have to run before you can walk...what a riot.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	After all the hype it finally came to bluray. Needless to say it was a very good movie and with Ridley Scott attached to it you were almost guarenteed a good quality movie. The action was definitely there. The CG was incrdible and the acting was very well done. I won't spoil the end for you but, it does make sense as you watch it fade to black. Well worth the couple of hours you'll spend at home.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"This is not like everyone think it is, it is not Alien prequel.<br />It capitalize on Alien popularity to create a buzz for this movie.<br />Then create a bunch of holes in the movie to make people talk about it, don't matter its good or bad.  I guess ""there is no bad publicity"" apply, at least people would be talking about the movie.  Well I would talk about the holes in the movie, the supporter of the movie would talk about the possibility of the hole with ""it will be explained in part 2"".  Because the hole is so big, there is a bunch of possibilities not everyone can be right.<br />I seriously hope there would not be part 2 because this first one is not that special, but because of the director's reputation I have no doubt he would get funds to make Prometheus 2 if he wanted.<br /><br />Edit:<br />Got a question regarding successful rich and powerful person Weyland in the movie:<br />Let's see Weyland can spend trillions for personal reasons, who does he hire?<br />1. Archeologist who is so stupid that she says this is scientific expedition, you will not need your weapons. What's worse is the guy listened.<br />2. Other archeologist did not report worm like infection in his eye, pretend like its nothing and went back on ahead to expedition.<br />3. Geologist hired to map the facility gets lost trying to find his way back.<br />4. Biologist stupid enough to try and pet an alien creature.<br />5. Weyland's bodyguard fires at Engineer's body which could be bullet proof suit, and not put a bullet to the uncovered head.<br />6. David gets himself killed when he either trying to get his ""father"" killed or communicate for his father, either way not so effective.<br />Weyland for a rich and powerful guy sure surround himself with incompetent people. Or maybe the inflation rate is so high, the trillion dollar is like our present day million dollars? Only way to explain the ""quality"" of employees he hired to save his life.<br /><br />BTW I know I am going to get lots of ""unhelpful"" on my feedback, that is the risk of bad review on a ""popular"" movie to a group of fans to a series or director.  Just like giving a bad review on a bad StarTrek movie and what Trekkies would react to that review.<br />Look I wanted this movie to be good, the previews on youtube was awesome and I love most of the Alien series.  I even pre-ordered this 3D Blueray before the movie came out, that is how much I wanted this movie to be good.  Only reason I am not cancelling this order is because it was cheap to own, also to show how much I wanted this movie to be good.<br />For people who saw this movie, ask yourself this question.  If you judge this movie based only on the story line and not on the actors, director, special effects, link to Alien or the hype, do you think it was a good movie? Many people would agree the answer would be a no."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Product arrived as advertised; brand new factory wrapped. First rate customer service. Jeff Dunham is very funny and talented. I enjoy sharing these DVDs with fanily and friends.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This is a GREAT movie.  I don't usually like animated movies, but this is wonderful.  Everyone in our family likes it and have watched it many times since we got it.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good family movie.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	It's all been said - the actors, special effects and directing just march on along a path of continual improvement.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	It's ok. Storyline too predictable visual effect average, and the end was kind of a let down, I would only rent this if you really love the story.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	The writers and director of IRON MAN have crafted a fine comic book adaptation, skilfully combining character, action. plot, and humour (the latter is essential in such movies, with many failing as a result of self-reverence). Here the script is sharp and lean, and is confidently delivered by a top-flight cast. The set pieces are well constructed and the special effects are impressive. The story, for the most part, is cohesive and convincing. There's not much to criticise here, except perhaps the ending, which is rather predictable. All in all this is first-class entertainment from start to finish.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	My wife and myself thought that the DVD of Harry Potter and Order of the Phoenix was very good
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	In spite of great acting and taut filming, the movie disappoints in a number of ways.  For those who had not first read the book, a great deal of the story line is puzzling, and for those who had read the book there is simply too many of the good things left out.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham has mastered this lost art with throwing his voice.  His puppets and their dialogue are hysterical!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Great buy! My son loves it! He plays every day with Matter and McQueen, it is true they are not the best quality, it's hard plastic, but they are holding so far...
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	The concept behind this movie was great.  But the execution was poor.  The movie was extremely boring, which made it seem to drag on forever.  Also, there was no original content.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I haven't seen a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat in a long, long time.  This one did.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Great movie! You won't be disappointed with this Boston based action thriller!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I had been dying to see this movie, found a cheaper price to purchase than renting. I received the movie in only a few days, brand new in the wrapper. Definitely EVERYTHING I HOPED IT WOULD BE!!! I would absolutely do business with this vendor again!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"""John Adams"" is a powerful. accurate depiction of a great man. Stodgy, unyielding, John Adams nevertheless was a bulwark of consistency as a tireless patriot and a strict constitutionalist. He was vocal in his rejection that the newly formed country adopt the fleshy indulgences of Europe, namely France and proved an effective, if relucant negotiator. Paul Giammani was superb in the role of our Second President who if outwardly aloof was privately emotional. Laura Linney played the perfect helpmate in Abigail Adams, who was quick both to encourage her husband and to constructively criticize whenever John got too bombastic. This series was a matchless viewing experience."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	Top to bottom a great movie with no weakness'.<br /><br />Call it.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Great movie. Words cannot express. Go see it. Buy it. Enjoy. Don't listen to over critical reviews who write a 10 paragraph essay on Amazon to seem like they know what there talking about. Less is more.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	This was well adapted from the Book.  Unfortunately JK Rowling's books are so long and beautifully conceived you could almost make it into 3 parts instead of 2.  Whoever adapted it, picked the essentials, with out lossing anything that was really important.  I can't wait to see the Deathly Hallows Part 2.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	so why is this Ultimate edition getting such bad reviews, i own the first 4 of these ultimate edition and i really like them, the boxing is really nice and all of the special features and items that are included really make for a great set. Alot of people seem to be upset that there is no extended cut but it doesnt say any where that there should be an extended cut. I understand that the first 2 years had the extended cuts which was cool, but definitely not the only reason to buy them. Stop acting spoiled, If you've decided not to like this product simply because it doesnt have an extended cut, then dont buy it but there is no reason this product should have an overall 2 star rating, its a great ultimate edition.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I purchased this item off of ebay NIB.  I absolutely love this workout and the meal plan too.  I lost 4.4 pounds the first week on the program/meal plan.  The workouts do absolutely wear you out and I'm still modifying the exercises and taking a few extra breaks so I can keep up.  It would be bad for people with bad joints or who don't like to jump around a lot.  It's like the first week of basketball practice when you were in highschool.  You do suicide drills and jump squats etc.  This is the first workout I've ever bought off of the tv, first infomercial type purchase and I could not be happier.  I'm on my second week and weigh in on Monday my pants are hanging off of me so I would guess I lost another 4 pounds or so. I'll keep pushing on!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"I enjoyed all three movies that Scorsese has made with Caprio. I've read the reviews, and all point and chastise Dicaprio for stiff performances. Basically, he couldn't live up to the roles that Scorsese hand picked for him. Bull****. Anyway, lifes crazy, and now they think of Dicaprio as satisfying. Even talking crazy stuff like nominating him for some sort of acting. Not sure if he star's or co-stars. Either though, so far in the year I mean. The power is incredibly in the style of the movie, which never fails to steal the audiance! The ending is ""goodfellas"" like, where everyone dies and who the hell wins!? Who cares, awesome ride. I highly recommend this title. I can't wait to see it again. I should mention that the cast is incredible. It's a sort of ensemble piece. Mark W. was incredibly good."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"""Must see"" TV for me is defined as watching every episode of ""True Blood"" on Sunday night as originally aired then rewatching and savoring each episode as recorded on demand. We watched the first season of ""True Blood"" over and over again yet highly anticipate the preordered DVD just so we can view each episode with director and cast member commentary. For instance, at the 42 minute mark in the final episode of the season, Ryan Kwantin who plays Sookie's brother Jason comforts his sister recovering  from the brutal beating she suffered and as Jason turns to leave, trips over the coffee table and nearly falls on his face. I personally think that pratfall was an accident. I'm guessing creator Alan Ball decided to retain that scene because it worked so well and so naturally to define  troubled yet likeable Jason's basic humanity. The commentary track normally included with most DVD packages should disclose if my suspicions are correct.  It will be fun to find out either way.<br /><br />Virtually every single cast member in this wickedly funny and at times shockingly graphic series is so believable and so downright likeable that the basic story line of vampires coming out of the closet in Louisiana to openly walk among us while demanding equal rights has an uncommon way of encouraging the casual viewer to examine his or her own personal prejudices in off beat, highly entertaining and altogether unexpected ways.<br /><br />Of course there will always be those who grouse that the storyline does not strictly follow the series of books by Charlaine Harris. Series creator Alan Ball argues there is a very good reason for that. The fact is Anna Paquin, recent Golden Globe winner for her turn as Sookie Stackhouse would be the most overworked actress on the planet if the storyline was strictly adhered to because as the books are written she would dominate virtually every single scene. Whew! Not only that, we would not have become so familiar with several of the wonderful characters we have been introduced to, specifically Tara, Jason and Lafayette as played by Rutina Wesley, Ryan Kwanten, and Nelsan Ellis respectively. These and many, many other gifted actors contribute mightily to making ""True Blood"" the runaway hit it has become. As any ardent fan of the book series knows, Season One barely scratched the surface and plenty of rich material has yet to be mined. If the series continues to be skillfully written, ""True Blood"" can easily air for 3, 4, even 5 or more seasons. We ain't seen nuttin yet!<br /><br />Alan Ball has done it again. Good for him. Good for us. ""True Blood"" is hands down THE most engaging series on television today."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"Ben Stein's expose' of the bias and bigotry of academia should be required viewing from K - 12. The politicization of education and science to indoctrinate an ideology has become symptomatic of the decline of Western civilization and the rise of authoritarian plutocracy.<br />A most dangerous example of this is the fraud of ""man-made climate change""."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"My son was two and a half when we first watched this movie with him on Thanksgiving. After that night, we watched it at least twenty more times until Christmas. My son was mesmermized, as his father and I were every time. We also were teary eyed just about every time at the touching messages about believing, friendship, caring for those in need and the simple gift of the magic of the holidays. We shared the movie with family and friends and they all loved it too. My son's favorite part was when the song, ""Hot Chocolate"" played so we had to buy the music CD, which he danced and sang to all holiday season and best of all it made him want to read the book the movie was based on every night, all of December. Finally, Matthew (who's name means gift) keeps saying to us even now, ""Mommy...Peter never, never, heard the sound...the bell...until he believed"".  Okay, so you are rolling your eyes and thinking this is too corny now, but just like the movie says, ""the important thing to know about trains is that you have to get on""."
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	"The best show in a decade.  I haven't watched a regular TV show since early 2000, but this show has me hooked.  If you like a mix of genre,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441017770"">Sookie Stackhouse, Books 1-7</a> this one to see. Part horror, part whodunit, part romance, it's got it all. Additionally, it picks up the ideas and themes in the books by Charlene Harris, which it is based upon, but goes off in a new direction adding new storylines. It's lots of fun and I highly recommend it!<br /><br />cyn"
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	This is the only movie that has meant anything since the Departed was released. It is Americans making good movies again. IF you are a man, this movie will remind you of what it means to be a man and fight something indestructible. I can live with the ending. People blame the Cohens for not doing the typical hollywood thing at the end. Too bad.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"I've read a lot of the other reviews and am frankly disappointed with many of them. The reasons that I have read for why these other people believed the movie was bad weren't really good. It's all based on opinion. I respect what the other people are saying, but some of it is just stupid. It's obvious that half the people didn't watch the movie closely at all or else they would've picked up on how M. Night filled in the blanks that they claimed made the movie flawed and unbelievable. If many of these people had simply paid attention to the details, then maybe we wouldn't be forced to read the reviews they posted that are based on something that they simply didn't pick up on.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me is that people are also saying that the movie wasn't a psychological thriller, which it very clearly was. Many people seem to get scary movie and thriller mixed up. A thriller is a movie with twists and turns, a revelation at the end, and other things along these lines. A thriller doesn't necessarily make a movie scary to watch, like the movie ""Memento"" for example. ""The Village"" is most definitely a thriller and rightly marketed as such.<br /><br />This movie was probably one of the most well-done movies that I have ever seen. It's so nicely shot and the music is great. I think that this movie was probably the best one Shyamalan has made aside from ""The Sixth Sense."" But then again, that's just my opinion. Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie, watch it and decide for yourself."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Great - very funny and Jeff Dunham is very talented!  I love sharing this with my friends!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I had never watched it before, and also the daycare children i watch enjoyed it also.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	I was thoroughly ready to love Prometheus. I mean hey, it's Ridley Scott going back to the future to fill us in on what happened prior to Alien. What could possibly go wrong? Turns out a lot...<br />Not only is the script a train wreck, but apparently no one attached to the film understood Genetics 101, to the point where one of the 'big revelations' toward the end blatantly contradicts the establishing scene (plus vfx title sequence) of the entire stinkin' film! I'm sorry, but if you're 12 feet tall and look like an albino version of a Na'vi from Avatar, then you're NOT genetically identical to a human being....<br />And what's with Guy Pearce in an old man suit ala the end of 2012? And why the artfully framed but meaningless interactions between him and the incredibly two-dimensional Charlize Theron?<br />And why did Scott think we were SO stupid that he had to show us TWICE (once subtly, once with a massive finger-splash) that android David contaminated Charlie's drink with the black magic DNA goo?<br />And why did the whole show give off the lackluster vibe of Alien vs Predator? One of the amazing things about Alien (and Aliens, for that matter) was it was a genuine surprise when some, though not all, characters got killed. The entire motley crew in this film was pretty well templated out, though; who'd live and die wasn't surprising at all.<br />And going from hack-job C-section to running around doing ANYTHING is just plain stupid. Bad, bad, bad call story-wise.<br />It just appeared to me that Scott short-cut storytelling in favor of on-screen dazzle. It looked great, mostly... I guess. The gaping holes in the story and the bad decisions very quickly ruined this film for me.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	A MUST OWN for your Blu-Ray collection.  The picture UNREAL and of course it is SIN CITY. The movie itself ROCKS!!!
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Up there with Indy 4 and Prince Caspian, Iron Man was one of the top movies I was looking forward to this summer. And thankfully, I was not disappointed. In fact, just about every aspect of the movie impressed me.  As I expected, Robert Downey Jr. captured Tony Stark better than anyone else could have.  The wit, charm, and intensity he brought to the character incorporated everything essential about the billionaire industrialist. He's a playboy, eccentric genius, with a drinking problem. But when Stark discovers that his own company's weapons are being used by terrorists, he decides to live a life of purpose and make some big changes.<br /><br />Donning several versions of Iron Man suits, Tony Stark goes through as much transforming as his inventions. Iron Man is an origin story, but still allows for plenty of depth and character development without letting the story suffer. The supporting cast exceeded expectations: Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and even director Jon Favreau himself plays the small role of Harold Hogan.<br /><br />The special effects and technology also blew me away. From the testing of Stark's armor to the final showdown, viewers will be impressed at the amazing visual effects and plenty of big explosions.  With plenty of humor to lighten up the scenes of intense suspense and action; Iron Man is sure to be entertaining enough for the whole family. And after the credits roll, there's a fun little clip that fellow Marvel comic geeks will enjoy, hinting towards a sequel with some beloved characters.<br /><br />The summer blockbusters have certainly started out with a bang!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Harry Potter is awesome! This movie is spell bounding! I have seen it 3 times and notice something new each time. This film is much darker than the previous movies. It absolutely answers questions one may have regarding the story. A must see for any Harry Potter fan!
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Short summary: great cardio, hard whole body workouts with no equipment required - very happy with results.<br /><br />I was out-of-shape starting this, having not worked out in a couple of months, and many years removed from my triathlon and adventure racing days. The first fit test (just 8 one minute exercises) left me gasping on the floor for the next 20 minutes. But I had my mind set on completing the program. I completed what I could for each interval, and every week was glad to see that I could complete more of each interval.<br /><br />The best part was the recovery week. The exercise for that week was a great mix of cardio, all-around strength, and balance. It was a hard workout, but not leaving you panting on the floor dripping sweat everywhere like the others.<br /><br />The second month was really like starting over. Workouts go from 40 to 60 minutes, and the warmup took some of the harder interval workouts from the first month. It seemed impossible, but just like the first month, you get better every week.<br /><br />In the end, I more than doubled my fit test results and was happy with the change in my build. A nice bonus was that it was easy to take workouts on the road while traveling.<br /><br />I hadn't planned on using the nutrition program, but it made a lot of sense: 5 smaller meals, whole grains, lots of protein, heavy on fruits and vegetables. So, using that and the workouts, I lost my goal of 13 pounds and an inch on my waist.<br /><br />Some pointers for those considering the program: be committed, as it takes a lot of willpower to do every day. Also be sure you have enough space (probably 8x8, plus a taller ceiling), and somewhere that you can jump without disturbing others.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Great Movie with positive reviews on its picture and audio quality. Great price. 'Nuff said.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is a great low buget movie that is very powerfull and a real tear jurker. I would recomend to any one or for a church showing..
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	You won't go wrong with this item,,,when it shows up. Normally I don't have problems with amazon shipments but this took almost 3 weeks to arrive.<br /><br />However, the DVD itself if execellent.  I've watched this at least 10 times now and laugh just as hard the 10th time as the first.  I wish Jeff had more titles out.
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	Wonderful (disturbing) information--I'll never eat a burger out again. Great motivation to eat healthy. I had one major issue though. Mr Hirshberg (Stonyfield) blamed business & capitalism for the disgusting industrial monopolies and the damage they are doing. Mr Hirshberg, you are a businessman and a capitalist...the wonderful Mr Salatin from Polyface Farms is a businessman and a capitalist. Capitalism is NOT the problem. Greed and corruption are the problem!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Children and adults love this movie.  I have a, 2 and 4 year old who love to watch it.  We also purchased the soundtrack and we all love it. Wonderful movie!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Robert Downey Jr. is a very talented actor and even though this was just a fun fluff piece for him to act, he did it with such finesse that it was a work of art.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	This program is exactly as it states... INSANITY.  The first couple weeks are the hardest workouts you will ever do.  Then you finally start to feel like just maybe you can really keep up with them.  Then you move on to month 2 thinking how could they possibly make these workouts any harder?!  Well after the 1st day you realize they can after you feel like you did on day 1 all over again!  I swear by this program. I'm on my 2nd time using the program, and 2 weeks into month two.  It is still just as hard as ever.  The reason is because the better you get at it, the more you can do in the allotted amount of time.  So it never gets easy!  But the results...OHHHH the results!  I've gone from a couch potato to teaching cross training to friends and preparing for a Tough Mudder!  Thank you Shaun T.!  Thank you Beach Body!<br /><br />30 lbs lost so far<br />tons of muscle I never had before<br />Best physical condition of my life
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"I have not yet seen this movie but based on what I know it should be really good.<br />It was received in good order and I am happy with my purchase!<br />Thank you for making a ""pre release"" order available."
B005ZMUQCK	4.0	b	I tend to agree with critics who reviewed this film when it was released.<br /><br />Not up to normal/past Pixar standards.<br /><br />I say it is most like A Bugs Life.  A good but not great film.<br /><br />Music did nothing for me.  Where was the normal stand out musical score?<br /><br />Standard extras, BUT no Making Of section.  I would have liked to have seen that.<br /><br />SOMETHING I HATE ABOUT SOME DVD PACKAGES.  THOSE HORRIBLE FLIP DOWN OPENERS.  YUCK!!!!!!<br /><br />Kids will enjoy.  Nascar fans will enjoy.<br /><br />Fun but forgettable after you watch it.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"My sons watch this movie a minimum of 5x's a day!! Geesh.. I can't get this away from them!<br /><br />And to the reviewer who was ""shocked"" at the movie using the words ""moron"" and ""idiot"" and that it was rated ""G"".. oh my gosh how horrid! GET A GRIP! Do you honestly believe your kids do not hear these words while in school? Are you going to protect their little ears when they turn 18 and go out into the real world? Oh man.. I totally wish that was all I had to worry about with my sons. Take a chill pill and be more worried about global warming then your kid(s) hearing the word moron. Good Lord!"
B006H90TLI	1.0	b	There isn't much I can say about this movie, I just had to come up with something so I could rate it & hopefully prevent amazon from bombarding my inbox with it. I hated this flick. I love Tommy Lee Jones, and his character was quite good - actually, the characters weren't so much the problem as the plodding pace of the movie itself. Even the plot was ok, but I was hoping for something a little faster. It reminded me of all those foreign intrigue dramas from the 70s & early 80s that I'd fall asleep to when I was sick home from school. I also need closure in my movies. I need to know what exactly happens to the characters without having to visit forums and 'cons. Twist endings are fine, the occasional cliff-hanger here and there, but in long, drawn out movies I would at least hope to be gratified with some closure. I suppose I could pick up the book somewhere and flip to the last chapter, but the movie left me afraid to pick up the book.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	This is a nice package, with lots of extras.  The movie quality is wonderful and gives the feel of seeing it in the theatre.  Of course the movie is wonderful and for all HP fans!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I thouroughly found this movie to be one of the greatest mini-series I have ever seen.  I had to ask for it for Christmas.  It is not only a history lesson but you really find yourself living it.  The acting is terrific, the costumes are period corrrect and the sets are lifelike (it was filmed in Williamsburg).  I grew up in Quincy just down the block from Peacefield and just recently went on the tour.  They did their homework and it shows. This movie portrayed John Adams to be one of the the most interesting of the founding fathers, next to Washington and Jefferson. It think it is a must see.
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	I'll admit, the theatrical trailer made this movie seem exciting and worthwhile, however, the actual movie experience was a major let down. The film itself seemed to drag on without a deep plot to justify the additional length. It felt like the film could have ended 30 to 45 minutes sooner than it did with the second half of the film being a chore just to get through. Additionally, while I thought Kristen Stewart would show some improved acting outside of the Twilight series, this film proved to me once again that she is a C- actress at best. There's a scene near the end of the film where Stewart gives an impassioned plea to rally the troops for a final battle. However, her poor acting skills were only magnified by this scene with Stewart being so overly dramatic to the point where it was just ridiculous. In fact, several people in the theater actually busted out in laughter during this scene. I'm sure the director did multiple cuts of this scene and if this was the best they could get out of Stewart then she has no hope of ever becoming an elite actress.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"The Premise:<br /><br />The Departed is a remake of the 2002 Chinese film 'Infernal Affairs.' Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) as a young boy gets sucked into working for Boston Irish Mafia boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). When he grows up, he ends up joining the State Police under Frank Costello's direction in order to be an inside man, or a rat, for the boss. Sullivan keeps Costello tipped off, and in-turn, Costello gives Sullivan information to help him solve cases. He promotes quickly and ends up working for the State Police Special Investigations Unit (SIU) who's sole task is to bring down Frank Costello.<br /><br />Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is also a State Policeman, or ""Statey,"" who's troubled past brings him to the attention of Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) who heads up the undercover division of the Boston Police overseen by Oliver Queenan (Martin Sheen). Dignam and Queenan are convinced that Costigan's high intelligence combined with his dubious background make him unsuitable as a traditional cop, so they offer him a job as an off-the-books, deep cover agent meant to infiltrate Costello's gang.<br /><br />Things get hairy when Sullivan, now working for the SIU, learns with certainty that the police have an undercover cop infiltrated into Costello's gang. The police then begin to suspect Costello has a rat inside the force. Sullivan gets yet another promotion, but this time his job is to find the rat inside the force. The problem is he is the rat. Meanwhile, Costello has another job for Sullivan: find out who the undercover cop is! Dignam and Queenan know the only way they are going to find the rat is through Costigan who's life is becoming more dangerous by the second. Which of each other Sullivan or Costigan find out first is a deadman.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br /><br />The only two real flaws I found in Infernal Affairs were the scene direction and lack of character development. I knew these were two things that Martin Scorsese was a master of, so I was very eager to see his take on the story. Exactly as I predicted, The Departed is a much deeper version of the story. You get a much stronger feel for the characters. The story definately moves slower, but you never get bored during any scenes. As well, the dialogue benefits greatly from this, and it's simply great!<br /><br />It's a very rare thing for such a stellar cast as featured in this film to be used so well. Most of the time when a film touts such a list of screen icons, most of them have bit roles and barely make an impact on the film. Here everyone's presence is strongly felt, and it's a wonder to behold such a cast working on such a strong film under one of the greatest film directors in history. Jack Nicholson reminds us of why he's the legend he is. Leonardo DiCaprio slams the lid on naysayers, and even Mark Wahlberg's performance is so good he blends right in with the amazing talent around him. You may even find yourself talking about his character more than any other after the film.<br /><br />The film is not perfect however. It does tend to feel a bit too long once you reach the third act, but not so much as to sway your overall feelings of the film. I knew and expected the film to be different from it's Chinese counterpart if simply for the fact that these are different societies and cultures we are talking about, however I didn't expect (and didn't approve of) how much The Departed would walk the lines of every idea being so black and white. In The Departed, good cops are good, and the bad cops are bad. Scorsese even makes a strong point never to show Costigan performing any truly bad deeds. Meanwhile Infernal Affairs makes a strong point to show shades of grey where neither cop was truly good and neither was truly bad. Instead, it focused on how each lived in their own hell and how it motivated their actions. The ending to Infernal Affiars was deep and thoughtful, while by comparison, The Departed feels almost cliche and very much like a ""Hollywood Ending.""<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />The Departed is easily the best crime drama since Heat. It's everything Miami Vice should have been. Martin Scorsese was born to make films like this, and this film is easily his best film since Goodfellas which coincidentally or not so coincidentally share common themes. In this film he masterfully weaves a complicated web of intrigue and deception. It may not be perfect, but damn is this one hell of a good film!"
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	"I'm an old adult male which may be the reason why I don't get this movie nor the previous ones. I love action movies with plots, but I totally miss the plot in the HP series and the action is a bit weak. The visual effects are good but barely enough to keep me awake. ""Transformers"" kept me awake."
B0006989TE	4.0	b	A surprisingly riveting thriller that lives of the M. Night Shyamalan reputation.  Some genuinely creeping moments.  By the end of the movie all of your questions will be answered in a satisfying manner.  Some really intriguing performances, especially from Bryce Howard, Ron Howard's daughter, as a blind villager determined to rescue her lover.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Great Transaction, Very fast.  Product was flawless.  Will do business again with this seller
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	This movie got off to a pretty good start.  The filmography was good, and the characters started off with good potential.<br /><br />About half way through the movie, the acting took a sharp decline, and the plot went sideways.  The ending left you inching to the edge of your seat but rather than hoping for more, you fell off.  It was almost a cliff hanger, but ended up being a real let down instead.
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	This show was really terrible. If you like the books don't waste your time. I was really looking forward to seeing this (I have all of the books) and I am so glad I rented it at our Blockbuster instead of buying it. I watched several episodes to be sure it was bad because I really wanted to like it. (discs 2,3 and 5). Lots and Lots (way too much) sex and Nudity. It's basically the whole story with this t.v. show.
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	This was by far the worst harry potter movie. It felt mediocre and really dumb and I hope people get this.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Sin City is made up of three of Frank Miller's graphic novels, and one tiny short story at the beginning.<br /><br />But the short story makes for a nice start into the film.<br /><br />The visual effects are amazing, and when i went to see what the graphic novels were like, i found that the images and camera angles in the film were a spot-on duplicate of nearly every page of those novels - of course with little changes here and there.<br /><br />Also amazing is the fact that it is as if each of the actors in the film were bron for their roles. They look almost surreally like the characters in the novels. Clive Owen is uncanny, Benicio Del Toro - albeit with a bit of make-eup and prsotethic - looks like the character in the book, Mickey Rourke - in my opinion - needed very little make-up to play Marv, as he's done a fairly good job of messing up his own face all by himself. But he truly steals the show as the daring, revenge-fuelled Marv.<br /><br />All-in-all, the film is mesmerising. Three strange but brilliant stories based in a whore-run, crime-ridden city. A classic...
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	what a dumb movie, don't see what the hype is about? Don't waste your time!
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Cars was the 7th feature film created by Pixar studios and it kept up the trend of excellent Pixar productions. Managing to win Pixar its 3rd consecutive best Animated Feature Academy award, there was no denying how good this film was. The story is clich&eacute; but the concept is still as fresh as Toy Story was back in the day. Its colourful and detailed environments, cars and sequences are put together brilliantly. Pixar makes its movies with this confidence in their own abilities. They seem to never doubt their animation skills or their general imagination for a unique and awe inspiring story.<br /><br />I mentioned that the story is clich&eacute; so I guess I should explain what I mean when I say that. Most Disney movies tend to be along the same lines with a main character who tends to be quite narrow minded and through a series of enlightening events manages to become open minded and a nice person. There's nothing wrong with that, after all it's good to teach our kids that we should all be open minded and nice people. If that's portrayed by a jealous toy or an overprotective fish then so be it. With that clich&eacute; plot device, Pixar still manages to create a unique film and a brilliantly funny in between to give us a hell of a lot of enjoyment.<br /><br />Cars focuses around stock car race car Lightning McQueen who's a racing champion and a sure fire shot at winning the prestigious Piston Cup. During the final race of the Piston Cup championship, a series of events lead to him and two other cars being tied in a photo finish. Because of this situation it is decided that the three will take part in a one off race to decide the true champion. Whilst being transported by Mack to California, McQueen rolls out the back of the truck while asleep and ends up lost in a small town known as Radiator Springs. McQueen accidentally damages the road in Radiator Springs and is forced by the towns Judge, Doc to stay until he fixes the road. While McQueen is in town he makes friends with a truck named Mater, who isn't the brightest bulb in the street. He also seems to develop a crush on another car known as Sally who's a porsche 911 Carrera.<br /><br />I wont tell you more about the story as it will essentially ruin the movie for you. The whole movie is just amazing and although I was disappointed with their follow up of Ratatouille, Pixar really made me a dedicated fan with this. I would strongly recommend this to any fans of their past movies or just to fans of movies in general as it's just overly entertaining and quite loveable.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This is one of his best movies<br />Lots of action and very good special effects
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Another star in Harry's crown! This is another well-developed and very entertaining, though dark, entry in the Hogwarts series. Well worth watching!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I've come to really like Pixar productions.  Good movies, good story lines and just enough underlying adult humor to keep the parents engaged.  This story is cute, one that I'm sure will be a hit with the little ones.  Great animation, big star voices and a good story line that offers some life lessons.  One to add to the library.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Iron Man is an excellent movie for anyone, regardless of age. Children can enjoy it because it's understandable to the younger views (and not too violent). Adults can enjoy it be it's fun, witty and entertaining.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Tony Stark to a T. I don't think they could have gotten a better actor to play this character. The story was well written and leaves plenty of room for sequels.<br /><br />The blu-ray version is very sharp, crisp and has some pretty nice special features.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham has got to be the funniest individual I have ever had the honor of watching.  Both DVD's are fantastic and can be watched and watched over and over again!  I highly recommend purchasing both and enjoy them for many years to come.  He is going to be in Tampa, Florida on New Years Eve and I am positive it will be a great show!  :-)
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	I loved this.  My husband thought becasue of the puppets that it was going to be so stupid and he didn't even want to watch.  It ended up to be super funny.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	We purchased this set as a christmas present for my 3-year-old son.  I saw the gift set at another store but when I searched it on Amazon it was listed for a much better price!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"When Marvel and Paramount first started promoting ""Iron Man,"" I expected it to be nothing more than CGI sequence after CGI sequence showing you just how far FX have come.  With Black Sabbath's song of the same name pumping up the viewer, it looked like just another empty action film.  Wow, what a nice surprise to walk out of the theater feeling as if I'd just witnessed a solid drama interspersed with excellent FX and action sequences.  Robert Downey, Jr. makes the lead role of Tony Stark/Iron Man his own.  Much like Michael Keaton when he suited up as Batman, I admit that I had my doubts when it was revealed that Downey, Jr. would head up this film.  Instead, Tony Stark comes across as one of the most believable characters to grace a comic book film adaptation.  He's a jerk, highly intelligent and self-centered.  When a life-changing (and almost life-taking) incident occurs, he returns to his home as a new man hoping to right the wrongs that his company has done for so many years.  Being a comic book film, naturally, a villain steps up to put a stop to Stark for both financial and egotistical gains.  The result is an all-out slugfest sure to please even the harshest critic.<br /><br />The cast is solid, from Terrence Howard as Rhodes to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts.  Jeff Bridges gives an excellent performance as Obadiah Stane, Stark's primary business associate in the weapons business.<br /><br />The actual suit(s) that make up Iron Man and his enemy look great on the screen.  The action sequences are brilliant, especially one involving civilian traffic.  Another highlight is Stark's home, which gives the Batcave a run for its money as far as gadgets go.<br /><br />Even though the FX are notched up quite a bit, they take a step back to the plot.  This is one of the most character-driven comic adaptations to hit the screen in a long time.  Perhaps it's the quality of the cast or the direction of Jon Favreau or a combination of both, but this story just doesn't feel like an ordinary comic book film.  The story is interesting, funny at just the right times, and never falls back on action or FX to bail out a scene.<br /><br />""Iron Man"" is a very, very good film.  It's a comic book adaptation that doesn't feel or act like a comic book adaptation.  Despite the bright red and gold armor, you'll find yourself more concerned with the man inside of the suit.  That makes a good film in my book.<br /><br />The PG-13 rating is necessary.  There's a tad bit of language and one swift roll in the hay between two characters.  The action is explosive, literally, and some younger kids may be put off by a few of the deaths in the film.  If you do have younger children who want to see this film (and I'm sure there are plenty), I think that a nine or ten year-old could view this with a little guidance from mom and dad.<br /><br />Highly recommended and hopefully a sign of things to come this summer film season.  Also, like everybody else seems to be warning, make sure to sit through the entire credits for a brief hint at ""Iron Man 2"" or perhaps an entirely new film that'll make fanboys jump with glee."
B00447G29S	2.0	b	This movie was sold in a package with 4 pairs of 3D glasses - the movie is NOT the 3D version!  I got ripped-off!  Buyer be aware!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	The quality of the movie was just great for a HD-DVD title. I was pleased to be able to watch it in HD. The movie hoes have its little quirks but the overall content was just superior to most other titles geared towards the Christmas stories. It wasn't all that long which is great for kids as it's hard to keep them watching and interested for too long. Tom Hanks does seem a little harsh at times in the film and almost a tad mean but he played the role quite well. I and my family was rather pleased with this movie.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	scorses does it again! this film has a very good plot very good acting and a hella good ending. maybe maybe scorses will get an oscar win but i dont think he will get it for this. but i think he at least should get a nom. but besides the point its a must see thrill ride full of twists and turns and an all star cast. a must see for scorsese fans!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This is even funnier that the 1st one!  We shared this at a family gathering and everyone really enjoyed it.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Comedic Genius. Achmed the dead terrorist is the best! Also the extra clips show the making of a puppet which I found fascinating. Can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I saw this movie in the theater with my granddaughter. We were both enthralled with the story and the excellent animation. I feel it will become a staple for the season and a classic on a par with Wizard of Oz.<br />I had to have it in my movie collection.
B004JMSIRC	1.0	b	"""Iron-Head"" only has great special-effects. The film has a weak script; for example; Robert Downey Jr. leaves secret robot plans and later, parts out in the open for the pursuing enemy to find. His assistant Gwyneth Paltrow threatens to quit when he readies violence to stop the bad guys who are killing innocent people.<br /><br />I would still have given 3-stars for the great special-effects, except the film tells teenagers and children, who we know are watching, to have sex with strangers. Robert Downey Jr. has sex with a woman he has just met that afternoon, whom he does not know; on top of one another, in bed, in the middle of the night; with Robert Downey Jr. in the process of undressing. This film was accompanied by children's comic-books, little-kid-size Halloween-costumes, and Iron-Head action-figures; showing younger children are targeted. What boy would not be thrilled to see a flying robot-suit. I am sure we will see Robert Downey Jr. promoting sexual-immorality in Iron-Head-2. Nowhere do we see Robert Downey Jr. show a change of heart. He fights the bad guys only because they attack him first. Real heroes do not make comic-book-hero films for kids that glorify having sex outside of marriage and with people you do not know."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	While The Departed was easily the best movie of 2006, the DVD simply falls way short. While it does offer some interesting documentaries in the special features, there is no behind the scenes documentary at all, and no feature commentaries by anyone. In fact there is barely anything on the 2-disc edition that is related to The Departed, which is pretty ridiculous considering the extra money paid.
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	I do not like this film. It omitted too much story from the novel. In my opinion, books 4-7 would have made better tv miniseries films, then a lot more of the story could be captured. Best part of the film is the acting. Ignore this film and stick with the first two films and the seven books.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is one of the best comedians around. He is a great ventriloquist, too :-)<br /><br />I saw this particular tour in Albuquerque, NM and highly recommend it. The DVD contains extras that include the creation of one of his puppets from idea to finished product.
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	Reading the reviews here and seeing the variety of reactions to Fireproof is almost as interesting as the movie itself.<br /><br />Most of the positive reviews focus on the message. Most of the negative reviews focus on the technical quality of the movie, and/or the reviewers' feelings about Christianity. Accordingly, I'd like to chime in on these three topics.<br /><br />Technical Quality: Although I did like the movie, I have to admit the negative reviewers have a point here. The cinematography and special effects are more in line with what you'd expect on a TV show than a feature film. There's nothing glaringly awful, but the viewer is definitely aware this film was not financed like a big-budget Hollywood movie.<br /><br />The acting performances are about the same. Cameron puts in a solid professional job, but nothing that's going to go down in history as one of the great performances of all time. The rest of the cast is pretty spotty, and most of them have at least one line or one scene that comes off a bit lame. Again, not so bad as to be unwatchable, but definitely below average for feature films.<br /><br />The Message: This is why people like the film, and why I liked it too. There are actually two messages here - one about marriage and one about Christianity. Most of the negative reviewers can't seem to separate these two issues, which is understandable since there' entwined. Let me take a stab at dealing with them separately.<br /><br />The marriage-related messages portrayed in this movie are:<br />1) Married people who are predominantly focused on their own feelings and their own needs are not likely to succeed. Marriage takes a lot of work, and a predominantly selfless attitude.<br />2) In order for a marriage to work, both partners have to be willing to admit that they are flawed human beings, that they make mistakes, that they are sometimes selfish and hurtful, and that they sometimes have to ask humbly to be forgiven. Christians certainly recognize this message, but it applies equally to non-Christians (except for those who are perfect, many of whom apparently have written reviews of Fireproof here).<br />3) There will be conflicts and hard times during a marriage, and when this happens, both partners must be committed to making it work and ensuring the survival of the marriage - even when this seems like a lot of work and doesn't seem to be rewarded or recognized.<br />4) For a marriage to really work, both partners will have to continually grow and improve themselves - often in ways that are not comfortable and entail sacrifices.<br /><br />Anyone who has actually been married for a while and worked through problems will recognize the above themes as true to life - and, most emphatically, true to life in a way that Hollywood movie portrayals of love and romance are definitely not true to life.<br /><br />I believe that most of the people who liked this movie - certainly me and my wife - are resonating with FINALLY a movie that seems to understand what enduring marriage and love that grows over the years are really all about. Most movies portray love as a state of blissful happiness - which it sometimes is - but miss the larger picture of love as an ongoing project that two people work on, working hard and selflessly, for many years.<br /><br />The Christian Message: People who are just flat-out offended by Christianity, or those who have past traumas, grudges, or anger toward Christians, simply are not going to like this movie. If you're in this group, just don't go.<br /><br />The people in this movie express and embody their work on their marriage and their personal growth through their faith. If you're a Christian, you will very likely identify with this and see it is a positive.<br /><br />If you're a non-Christian who has a generally benign, friendly attitude toward Christianity and Christians, this movie might be worth a try for you. The challenges these folks face and the things they have to overcome are not limited only to Christians, and may be familiar to you. They do frame their solutions and their personal work in Christian terms. If you're interested in Christianity, or how Christains frame and work through personal problems, then this movie might have some interest for you.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"I'll try to make this review short and sweet.  I had never seen Jeff Dunham until I , by random chance, saw this performance aired on Comedy Central.  I laughed so hard that I cried.  Three times.  Since then, I've watched this video at least 10 times, and it never gets old.  It still busts me up with laughter.  His 5 ""guests"" are all unique and wildly entertaining, and Jeff's abilities as both a witty comic and as a talented ventriloquist are simply incredible.<br /><br />I highly recommend that any watcher of stand-up comedy should see this video.  If you don't, you're really missing out on some excellent material!"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This video gives consumers a look into what we are really putting in our bodies.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	The 3D in this movie is great. I have been waiting for this to come out in blu-Ray 3D for awhile. This is a great buy, especially at a great sale price.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	When you get you mind beyond the wand...the power of charactor componets is the real magic
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I loved this movie and will be purchasing it to share with others who didn't get to the theater and to enjoy again myself.  Even if you aren't a Christian, which I am, there are lessons to be learned on how to improve your marriage.  If you hate Christianity then you will probably be very negative since this is a Chrisitan themed movie.  I wish other movie makers would give us good quality, moral movies to enjoy.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Jon Favreau delivers an awesome movie! A good comic book transition. Not bad for an actor.<br /><br />Jon Favreau updated the Iron Man mythology to the Iraqi War from Vietnam which makes better sense than trying to complete a period piece. The basic plot points are the same from the comic book.<br /><br />Tony Stark ironically gets injured from his own weapons and is saved by Youren, his cell mate in Afghanistan. Arab mercenaries have captured Stark and force him to build the Jericho, his ultimate weapon. Of course, he builds the Iron Man suit to fight them off and get away. Back in Malibu, California, Tony shuts down the weapons manufacture section of Stark Industries and works on perfecting the Iron Man suit. Meanwhile, his dad's friend and Tony's mentor, Obadiah Stern, goes nuts and tries to take over the company (of course). He steals the technology that keeps Stark alive and uses it to power his own Iron Man-like suit to reek havoc all over L.A. Of course Iron Man gets up and fights him off. Everyone lives happily ever after and he reveals himself to be Iron Man.<br /><br />Agent Coulson from S.H.I.E.L.D. helps Pepper Potts save Tony and assists in destroying Obadiah. Agent Coulson wanted to debrief Tony on how he escaped Afghanistan, but he never got his chance. He sets up a future appointment with Pepper Potts and exits. Nick Fury makes a post-credits appearance and tells Tony that he isn't the only superhero in the world, and tells him that he wants to talk to him about the ""Avengers Initiative"". Sets up future events for Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America and of course the Avengers.<br /><br />If you're going to see or have already seen the Avengers (2012), it's best if you watch Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man and Iron Man 2. It's not needed but it will make sense of things described in the plot of the Avengers."
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	"I am not really overweight, but not in great shape either. The problem I have with these videos is 1) The warmup is 20 minutes long and will wear you out before you can do the actual workout.<br />2) There is no upper body included in the warmups so when you are spent, you've only done legs and cardio.<br />3) Even if I could do the full 40 minutes, I do not look forward to taking that much time from my day to get a workout.<br /><br />There are better programs that can whip you into shape in less time. If you are finishing these workouts, you are already in good shape. As others have mentioned, people in the class on the video are dropping out during the warmup phase.<br /><br />On a positive note, the production value is outstanding. Shaun T is motivational, and not annoying to listen to. The music is not your typical electronic repetitive rhythm, but it's more of an orchestral Rocky-type soundtrack, which is great.<br /><br />However, if you are looking to do a workout that only takes about 20 minutes and will really work your muscles and cardio, I recommend: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00127RAJY"">Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred</a> The production value is much lower, and I have to turn the volume down so I don't have to listen to her, but I just play my own music on the stereo."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Iron Man seems made for Blu-Ray, although it succeeds in any format.  This witty, human, explosive action film sets a high standard, along with The Dark Knight, for the genre.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr is Tony Stark, a playboy, irreverent billionaire who believes, like his father, that whoever had the biggest stick keeps the peace.  His company provides the US government with high tech weapons meant to destroy enemies in enormous numbers, and he sees nothing wrong with it.  However, Tony finds himself at the wrong end of Stark Enterprises and has an epiphany.  Iron Man emerges from this psychological low:  a uniquely powered metal suit with jet packs, flame throwers, and brute strength that houses Stark.  A weapon, yes, but one designed to protect.  Unfortunately, his displaced second, once the CEO of Stark Enterprises, Stane (Jeff Bridges) does not agree with the direction Stark intends to take his company.<br /><br />Downey, Jr. is simply perfect for the role of Tony Stark -- he plays smarmy as well as he does brilliant, intense as well as he does comic, heartless as well as he does lovable. His facial expressions while ""inside"" the Iron Man suit remind us that a human we can empathize with is contained within the seemingly invincible armor.  Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet, if a little ditzy, as romantic interest Pepper Potts, but her performance stands up against Downey Jr's charismatic screen presence, not an easy feat.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning, particularly on Blu-Ray, and the soundtrack is powerful.  The Blu-Ray comes with two discs containing some special features of note:  the creation of the special effects; interviews/commentary, mostly with Stan Lee, of the evolution of the comic book series; and a fun glimpse into Downey Jr's and Bridge's rehearsal of one scene.  Blu-Ray also includes BD Live, if you're into that kind of online chat.  (I don't have the regular DVD, but I assume that the two-disk version has the same extras, minus BD Live.)<br /><br />This was a fun, action-packed, and at times humorous superhero film. Unlike some blockbusters, this film uses special effects to supplement the acting and the action, not the other way around.  I enjoyed every minute of it."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Being a history buff, I was really excited to get this video. It brought the book to life and was true to the book(something that is rare).<br />I was surprised by Giamatti's performance. Indeed, both he and Laura Linney were picks that took me aback, but did they ever hit it out of the park!<br />Their performance were stellar and humanized these two icons perfectly without making us hate them.<br />It is long, but so was the book. A life like theirs takes time in the telling.<br />Well worth it all. Thanks
B0006989TE	2.0	b	This should of been marketed as a love story, because it was not scary. It has some problems also, like why or how the mentally unstable kid made the strangely inhuman grunting sounds at the end of the film. Also, why did they need to keep up a facade of being in the 17th century, their children would have no idea what the 17th century was since they grew up in that secluded village and never would of had contact with the outside or modern world. So in reality they could of just dressed like they did and made it 2005, I mean no one but the elders would know what 2005 should look like. They even could of made it the year 3000, the point is the time period did not matter since all the elders knew it was a facade in the first place and the children would of had no idea since they grew up in that village and had no idea what modern was or the year it actually was. Get my point? Also, the monster idea was dumb, I mean wouldn't of someone in the village have tried to kill one of those beasts, someone who did not know what they really were? Like if a bear lived in the woods and supposedly was threatening or had killed a villager, regardless of what the elders said someone should of had the guts to try and kill one of them. Good idea but could of been wrapped up in 30 minutes, also he should of really had genuine monsters and could of really developed what they were and why. Maybe even using the Salem witch hunts as a background. He had a lot of opportunities to make a good horror flick but instead made a sappy love story.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	A fabulous, well done, true to David McCullough's book, the story of John Adams, his life and times, is perfectly presented. The whole history of our war with England for our freedom as seen thru a the mind and eyes of a dedicated patriot, his wife, Abigail and the handful of patriots who both appreciated Mr.Adams and despised him! All the joys and sorrows of family life and all the painful decisions endured by Mr. Adams, his friends and enemies, became real. I was completely drawn into the Revolutionary era and I could feel the terrible effects of angst, indecision, and suffering of both the American and British common folks and the sacrifices made by our forefathers. This portrayal of John Adams, his times, has been presented magnificently.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"Filled with spoilers because buying/watching this was annoying.  I know my bar for Ridley Scott is high, but considering you'll see his name or ScottFree at least 10 times before the movie starts, I think a high bar is fair. LOL.<br /><br />Blu-Ray - 1 takes forever to load.  I'm talking 4-5 minutes of black screen after the Blu-ray may take a while warning.  Loaded Avengers = 10 seconds.<br /><br />Supposed to connect with Alien - So explain why the ""Engineer"" doesn't die in the pilot's seat as shown in the first 15 minutes of Alien.  The ""mama"" Alien barely looks like Aliens.  I'm not one to be nit-picky but seriously I don't think the screenwriter and/or effects designers have watched Alien.<br /><br />The robot - Seriously, ""Data"" from Star Trek without the silver makeup but with pink lipstick instead.<br /><br />Rich Guy - makeup, think Old Biff from Back to the Future.  I think they just reused the mask.<br /><br />I think other reviews have hit on other points.<br /><br />Ships Captain - (probably the best supporting character) a black man who carries a squeeze-box from Crosby, Stills, Nash and sings their songs. Ugh!<br /><br />Charleze Theron - Rich Girl In-Charge - has a medical bay that is only for males.  ""I didn't come 2 years away from Earth to get laid... Come to my room in 10 minutes to get laid."" Nuff-said!<br /><br />A spaceship that is 2+ years away from Earth with a ""lifeboat"" that doesn't fly.  Guess what ... the Alien is on the lifeboat.  So maybe they watched enough of Alien/Aliens to go for a recurring theme.<br /><br />The mapping team that leaves first but is the only pair to get lost. I swear I thought that guy was Jason Sidekis? from SNL.<br /><br />A genetic poison that is used by the robot to make Alien sperm that impregnates an infertile female to have a c-section that turns into a giant Alien egg layer, that lays an egg circa Alien in an Engineer, that turns into Mama Alien.  Really.<br /><br />Incept-alien.  An alien in an alien laying an alien to spread aliens.<br /><br />Do yourself a HUGE favor ... just watch Alien/Aliens again!!!"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This movie is pure enjoyment from second one to the closing credits. Talking about the finest animation usually provided by Disney/Pixar partnership is redundant. The plot is convincing (except for the talking cars) as it approaches the modern life in detriment of slow-paced and honest small town America.<br /><br />The movie also approaches the value of having true friends around you and shows that helping others in their most difficult moments gives a sense of self-fulfillment and that no money or glory can ever replace.<br /><br />Entertainment guaranteed or your money back. Truly a family flick.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Not only is this a great movie for all ages, but owning it on Blu-ray is fantastic.  I have had the standard DVD for a few years but the Blu-ray DVD is truly several steps up in picture quality.  The colors are more vivid and sound is outstanding!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"This movie is a winner, plain and simple.  It has believable and pulsing action scenes, an excellent storyline, and tells a tale of tragedy that doesn't end like people want it to.  Thats the real problem with alot of people, in my opinion.  You want the good guy to make the bust or the bad guy to go down in some extended scene while he goes for a gun in slow motion, hero shouts something about not doing it, and then fills the bad-guy with x-number of bullets.  Welllll.... there are about 300 movies out with that ending, so once you see the bad guy buy a shirt, stop the movie, put in your random bad-guy-dies-at-the-end-in-an-overdramatized-scene-that-cheaply-gives-audience-closure-the-same-way-it's-always-been-done movie, and play the final scene.  Otherwise, you can sit there in awe as you (wait for it) actually PAY ATTENTION when Tommy Lee Jones recites the final line, realize what it means, and feel the final tragedy of this movie.<br /><br />All that ranting aside... this is an excellent movie that combines believable action sequences, excellent story, but not the most cerebral dialogue (which is good considering the movies setting - two wise cracking know-it-alls in 1970's small-town texas would be plain dumb).  The only time I felt cheated was the scene that I thought should have been the best, but they end up skipping it and going through the wrong person's point of view.  In a sense, that portrayal was when the film makers decided to harp on the tragedy of the story, and said there had been enough action.  I think I would have gotten the sense of tragedy if they did a gun battle in the style of Way of the Gun or simply did a long build-up with blindingly quick end... or a... ok, I'll stop.<br /><br />Now, a movie can be good, and a movie can be re-watchable good.  I have played this movie over and over again, it is one of the few movies I actually own (I have many older DVD's but decided a long time ago that buying movies is ridiculous if they spend years tucked away and unused).  In my opinion, this is a ""buy"" movie, and not a rental."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Great movie!  I only go see about 5 movies a year and I would put this one on my list.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"2008 gave us three excellent superhero films: The Dark Knight, The Incredible Hulk.....and Iron Man. Director Jon Favreau truly did his homework while researching Marvel Comics' high flying superhero, and it shows. I think i was one of the very few who thought it would be tragic if there were missteps to putting Iron Man to the big screen. I mean, for every Spiderman or X-Men 2, theres a Ghost Rider or original Punisher. But Favreau understood the appeal and complexities of billionaire Tony Stark, and took what was considered by some to be a second tier character and gave him three dimensional authenticity.<br /><br />For starters, lets not forget Stan Lee, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby, who created Iron Man in ""Tales of Suspense # 39"" in the early 60s. Theirs is the blueprint from which this film sprang. It is soooo faithful to the origin of the character, despite modernizing certain elements, which i was totally fine with, since it made total sense: Instead of Vietnam, we see Stark captured in Afghanistan. Instead of a jungle warlord, we have members of a Taliban-type organization, yet the weapons manufacturing angle remains intact. We see Stark's interaction and subsequent friendship with fellow inventor/prisoner Yinsen, well played by Grant Toub. The moment when Stark creates and puts on his original, bulky silver suit of armor had me grinning from ear to ear, blasting his way from captivity<br /><br />As he returns to America, Stark, who was a munitions manufacturer for the U.S. military, decides to change his views on weapons of war and instead use his gifts to battle those who threaten the oppressed, here as well as overseas.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr is the engine that drives this film from beginning to end, and hes brilliant. Anyone who knows the character of Stark from the comic books knows hes an at times arrogant, shallow playboy who enjoys his drink and his women. Downey has him down pat and his transformation from selfish, wealthy jerk to a slowly caring humanitarian/hero is peppered with humor and wit. The times we see him designing his suits of armor, through trial and error, mostly error, are funny, yet we see the human being in him with a newfound cause, and the moment in the film when he travels back to Afghanistan, as Iron Man, and wages war on his former captors as they terrorize innocent villagers, will make you jump up and down.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges, one of my favorite actors of all time, plays Obediah Stane, who runs Stark Industries with Tony and acts as father figure to our hero until we discover his true nature and motivations concerning continuing their weapons division. He's a great bad guy. Even Gwyneth Paltrow delivers fun work as Pepper Potts, Tony's assistant. This is the only time i can say i enjoyed watching her on screen, and shes actually fun to watch in her playful interactions with Downey.<br /><br />Tight direction from Favreau, a great screenplay, excellent special effects and a fun, multi-faceted performance from the multi-talented Downey makes ""Iron Man"" one of the better superhero adaptations to come along in a while.<br />Loved it."

B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I think Jeff himself has improved in his technique despite possibly having been one of the best, if not the best, in his field. He is simply outstanding in this flawless performance. Just a wealth of talent in one of the funniest comedies you can watch of all time. A must see. You cannot go wrong and will be laughing throughout the WHOLE performance.
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	strange southern Mississipi environment;very violent construction of the whole plot.Exacerbated sex scenes.one do not fully understand what the screen player wants to deliver as a message,if any,to the audience.Yet it is intriguing and worth being seen.

B00447G29S	2.0	b	"I am truly confused. Reading the reviews it sounds as tho many rec'd a disc that is true 3-d. Mine has a 2-d disc and a 3-d disc that uses some cheasy kid cardboard glasses.  I have a true HD 3-d I just purchased a few months ago and was really looking forward to watching this in true 3-d.  I notice the casing does not say blu-ray.  Can anyone expand on my understanding (after the fact) that unless you get blue-ray 3-d you are not getting the true 3d dvd to be watched on the new tvs?  And why did some buyers get what seems to be the real deal as advertised and others such as myself get the ""low budget"" version?"
B005ZMUQCK	2.0	b	DUD-  Our family loves PIXAR movies.  We watch them often.  But no one ever picks this one.  The grandchildren who will watch movies over and over never made it to the end of this one. So thank you PIXAR for all the joyful fun and love you have given to the world before this.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I was shocked after watching this documentary based on the industrialized food system. I recommend it to all of my friends because I think everyone needs to know the truth about the food they are consuming. It has changed my life. We now avoid feed-lot meat and buy mostly organics. Every minor change will make a difference. I truly believe that everyone deserves high-quality food and the truth should not be hidden from us. By watching this movie, you will educate yourself and then make your own decisions. Don't worry, it is not hard to watch like some PETA footage.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	"We saw our grandson over the holdiays and he is just so infatuated with Jeff Dun-HAMMMMMMM  that he made us sit down and watch this video! Frankly, I was sure it was a 12 yr olds humor! But we laughed until we cried! Some of the ""skit"" with the puppets (Achmed?) were a little off color, but not too bad!"
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	The dwarves are probably the most interesting part of the whole movie, which is drawn out far longer than it needed to be.  It is okay for a cheap rental but you may end up fast forwarding now and then.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	If you are looking for a movie to show off your new Blu-Ray player, this is it!  The picture and sound quality are amazing.  The opening sequence is one that you should have your sound system cranked up for.  I also own this movie on regular DVD but it was like watching a new movie.  This is a favorite in our family for both kids and adults.
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	"Star for visuals, star for the ""theme"" of movie, and a star for fassbender being the only person that I liked in this movie.<br /><br />If you like Alien, don't expect this to be an actual.....""Alien"" film? Half of the movie is about our creation, the other half is about how a xenomorph is made....kinda.....<br /><br />I can't really tell what this movie is either, its a...scifi....action....horror.....slasher???<br /><br />It's really good looking, but has some really deep plot holes that just make it silly at parts.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure Scott didn't write this so I guess it's not all his fault?<br /><br />GONNA RUIN SOME SH*T FOR YOU SO STOP READING<br /><br />The movie sets up for well....another movie and I'm not sure how I feel about a sequel to a prequel it just seems sort silly. Now after a little bit of research apparently the ""creator"" homeworld is suppose to be some super geiger landscape which would be cool to see but.....man the first movie is hard to digest.<br /><br />It's not the subject of the movie that is hard to understand so much as delivery of said subject material. Too many elements that really didn't hold any signifigance to the story or further the actual plot in any way.<br /><br />I could not STAND Noomi Rapace in this movie. She was obnoxious to me and I didn't understand why her character lived through....well any of the stuff that happened to her. She survives the storm, the infection (she was exposed to the black goo via her husbands penis), the squid baby, the falling ship, the creator, and not to mention the bounding leaps that she is able to make after having a c section minutes ago. I guess I was expecting to see more from Charlize Theron because I liked her character but then she just get's killed which makes her character pointless.<br /><br />That being said, it's interesting to watch but it could of been WAY better."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I bought this movie for my son and the whole family loved it. It is a great movie
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Effects are very interesting but story development and acting are off.  I just never got the sense that Snow White was a person of character that justified everyone's devotion.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"This DVD was the first I ever heard of from Jeff Dunham. The first time I saw it was late at night and I was the only one awake in the house, I couldn't stop pounding my fist sharply on the couch as I continually fell over crying of laughter (I couldn't laugh out loud as I would have woken up my room mates) but that didn't stop me from falling on the couch in laughter over and over. One of the funniest comedians to come along in years. The best thing about Jeff Dunham is that unlike comedians like Dane Cook and Ron White and even politically incorrect comedians like Dennise Miller: Jeff Dunham actually makes you LAUGH! His comedy, even when talking about social and political issues is presented in a light-hearted way as not to be ""We're all F&$#ed"" but rather ""This is Funny"". With Walter and Peanut and the other characters you get conversational comedy which makes it more enjoyable than just a 90 minute monologue. FUNNY AS HELL!"
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	The Departed puts a new twist on classic cop/gangster movies (think Scarface, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way & LA Confidential) with an all star cast (Matt Damon, Jack, de Caprio, and a Baldwin in a role you don't hate him for).  The Irish mob has a mole in the state police, and the police have a mole in the mob.  Who finds who first?  How are their positions mirrors of each other, and how are they divergent?<br /><br />The name of the movie comes from a preoccupation with death.  Death of family, death of characters (guess what, some die!) and death as motivation.  This theme is one of the unique spots of the movie.<br /><br />The move also has the breakout role of Mark Wahlberg.  Despite having seen Invincible the night before, this viewer didn't reaize he was in the movie until after.  He disappeared THAT much into his role.  In a sense it was a subtle show stealer - and he showed himself an elite actor on the level (above the level?) of the other stars.<br /><br />More than just a gangster/cop flick, this joins the gallery of the great gangster/cop flicks.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"you think that ""farmers"" just grow food... boy you're wrong.  there is a whole network of organizations conspiring to keep corn prices low.  the usda and fda need to wake up.  watch this movie and you'll be amazed.  i had no idea how awful the food system has become in this country.  would have never seen this video if not for amazon's new prime.  awesome move from an awesome service.  now you just need to work out a license deal with apple so this can be on iphone."
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	Even though I am a Harry Potter fan, I like to get the two disc special editions for the extras alone. This edition let me down. All it was were the specials from HBO that most have already seen.
B0065AVWGU	1.0	b	"Pay attention to the other viewer reviews, positive and negative.  They're telling a pretty consistent story.  There is little in the way of ""art"" here.  Unfortunately, I was suckered in by the professional reviews.  This is violence for violence's sake.  Pretty much period.  The acting is wooden, the script is lame, and there's no message to speak of.  But if what you're looking for is over-the-top violence, this is the movie for you (and possibly even the ""GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE"").  Oh, there are also a plentiful number of scantily clad or partially unclad young, attractive women.  And as the other reviews make clear, much of the violence is explicitly within the context of sex (or the sex business, or as a substitute for sex, or...).  Some of it was pretty disturbing.  Or it would have been if the visuals weren't done in the spirit of the original comic book rather than real life (oh, I'm sorry, ""graphic novel"").  Of course, that's the main drawing point of the movie, the linkage of violence and sex.  As repellant as I found this movie to be, they did do a excellent job of sticking to their main point.  I found it pretty darn misogynistic really, but it just may be your cup of tea.  Of course, the black and white visuals with splashes of color was an interesting approach, but not worth sitting through the movie for.  I would like to give this zero stars but the system won't let me."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I just finished watching The Departed on blu-ray DVD and it is one great movie. The Departed is about a cop named Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) who grew up in a crime filled neighborhood. He becomes an under cover cop who has been planted into Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) crime operation. It's up to Billy to win Costello's trust and help his colleagues (Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen) bring Costello down. There is an unexpected twist when officer Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) gains everyone's trust in the department. What they don't know about officer Sullivan is that he's Costello's mole. The Departed while keep you glued to your TV as you deal with all the of twists, and turns. Martin Scorsese makes a great and very entertaining movie that reminds us why we like to go to the movies in the first place. The cast is amazing and I believe this is going to win BEST PICTURE, BEST DIRECTOR and/or Best Supporting Actor (Mark Wahlberg) at the Academy Awards this year. As for the blu-ray DVD the picture and sound are top notch and the bonus features are good.<br /><br />DVD Features:<br /><br />Available Subtitles: English, Spanish, French<br /><br />Available Audio Tracks: English (PCM), English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 5.1), Spanish (Dolby Digital 5.1)<br /><br />1080p high definition 16x9 2.40<br /><br />BD-50<br /><br />PCM English 5.1, Dolby Digital English 5.1, Dolby Digital French 5.1, Dolby Digital Spanish 5.1<br /><br />Special features (480i or 480p standard definition, 2.0 stereo):<br /><br />Nine additional scenes with introductions by director Martin Scorsese<br /><br />The Story of the Boston Mob: the real-life gangster behind Jack Nicholson's character<br /><br />Crossing Criminal Cultures: how Little Italy's crime and violence influence Scorsese's work<br /><br />Theatrical trailer
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is his best yet.  I'm planning on seeing him live when he is in the area.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	Don't expect a faithful telling of Snow White.  This film is very dark.  Great to look at, but it goes on way too long.  Another problem is that Charlize Theron is much more attractive than the actress who plays Snow White!  The movie is so dragged out that this review was written while I was watching it!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	I'm at a loss to understand the low scores many have given this movie.  It seems as if the comments about violence or the ending miss the point entirely.  The ratings and reviews should warn warn the viewer that there are some extremely violent scenes, and to know that and then complain seems pointless.  Do they watch Amadeus and complain there is too much classical music?  Conversely this is not a simple Shoot Em Up (much as I like that movie).  It is not a simply constructed story, with the possible exception of Woody Harrelson's part, nor is it simply resolved.  So yes, if you want a simple cowboy movie you'd be better off  buying 3:10 to Yuma.  No Country does contain some very good performances by the lead actors, and some marvelous cinematography, and to my mind that makes for a great movie.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"Being a fan of American history, I found this DVD to be very entertaining and educational. Growing-up in the Boston area, I was facinated by the depiction of Boston in the 1700's. Being from this area, you take for granted the vast amount of history that is all around you.<br /><br />The movie is incredibly well done and the acting is as close to perfect as you can get. Paul Giamatti is a gifted actor as is his counterpart, Laura Linney. Casting, set design, costuming, script were all exceptional (You will swear that David Morse IS George Washington). You will get engrosed in this film and form a bond with the characters, which makes Part 7 so heartbreaking.<br /><br />It makes you appreciate the trials and sacrifice that our forefathers endured to give us the freedom and luxuries we enjoy today. It's a painful excercise to compare the politicians of today's world to the men of character, sacrifice and honor that founded this country. I pray that they do not look down upon us in disbelief and sorrow.<br />As is stated by Adams in the last scene: ""Oh, posterity. You will never know how much it cost us to preserve your freedom. I hope that you will make a good use of it. If you do not, I shall repent in heaven that I ever took half the pains... to preserve it."""
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This series very made very well made. Pleasantly suprised.  My whole family was able to enjoy these with the exception of having to fast forward two parts (just because of my extra small children).  I would highly recommend this series for anyone wanted to get a look at John Adams and the world in his time.
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	tried to watch on tv, but kept stopping to reboot...aggivating....Finished watching on PC.  not a very good story to start with..$3.99  deffinately wouldn't buy it.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I very much enjoy this set of DVD's. I like history and we all could use more understanding of what our forefathers went through to our benifit. This mini-series is the best yet!!!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"Its really hard to review a standup comedy routine  ""critiquingly"". If it's GREAT, like this one is, I would have to resort to the overwhelming non-lack of cliches plastered on the covers of movie boxes and posters across the Land.<br /><br />What it boils down to, is this (and its very simple): This is one of the funniest and most tallented stand-up acts I have ever seen. You have your all-time greats like Pryor and (fill in your fav here) but did they hold three-way conversations at lightning speed and legibly conveying three unique voices with three different personalities? Either he has incredible tallent or he's related to Emily Rose.<br /><br />In short, its fantastic - Excellent - pullamuscle funny - and man does it deliver. Highly recommended for you adults who need a change in pace.  ~saos~"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	A wonderful adult level animation for anyone 6 to 96.  A splendid historical romp!  Enjoy!  Pixar's done it again.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	One of my sons turned me on to Jeff Dunham. He's quickly become a family favorite and we delighted in seeing him Live the following year as a family. Can't wait until next month when his new Christmas show is released.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Charlize was excellent as always.  Unfortunately, Kristen Stewart only has one facial expression - if you put the sound on mute while Kristen is on screen you will be unable to distinguish the happy screens from the sad scenes because her expression NEVER changes.<br /><br />Watch this movie to see Charlize's performance and the great scenery.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	The audio and video were outstanding!! I wish that the MANUFACTURES would make available only the single Blu-ray disc in their released packages. I don't care for those extra disc for the same movie. To me its over-kill on the same movie,one copy is enough! Just a thought!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"""The Polar Express"" is an amazing Christmas family movie and is little different than any other Christmas movie out there. It focuses on children who are in their crucial year, and who are on the verge of forgetting how magical Christmas really can be.<br /><br />As a result, they decide to go on a magical train ride that not only will bring them to the North Pole to meet Santa, but also will teach them some very valuable life lessons along the way, one of which is to ""believe"".<br /><br />Tom Hanks is just outstanding, and his ability to transform from one character to another is flawless.<br /><br />The 3-D Blu-Ray version of this movie is just as good as it will ever get. I have literally watched this movie over a 100 times, and it will never get old."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I received this product right on time, at a great price and was just as described.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) military/industrial weapons mogul just finished demonstrating his newest rocket in the Middle East, when he is purloined by ruthless locals with dirty faces and a penchant for power. Who could be behind the dastardly deed? Of course everyone knows it is the last person you would suspect as in any good mystery.<br /><br />Well as luck would have it, in Starks efforts to escape he invents the fundamental technology for, you guessed it, Ironman. In the process he inadvertently gives the world a new weapon. How can he correct his faux pax?<br /><br />In his quest for the answers he solicits the help of his very efficient and devoted assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow.)<br /><br />For those enthralled in the Ironman comics, nothing has changed; except maybe the storyline. O.K the era in which how superhero exists. Well maybe a tad more gratuities sex. O.K. I guess I could go on for a few more paragraphs but you get the picture that we can not rely on the comic book character to be anymore than an inspiration for this movie.<br /><br />For people that are more music orientated, among the popular background songs they included the original theme from the animated series.<br /><br />It has all the formula and characters for today's super hero movies. By not making it a period piece we get to incorporate all the latest technology and social attitudes.<br /><br />Only saw the Blu-Ray version. Had the standard extras and flexibility. I am pretty sure future versions will add more insight or at least more footage.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IIPIK"">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OCMR"">Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OPPBEQ"">The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray</a>]"
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Great film! Not only is the cinematography great but the story of our food supply is definitely eye-opening! Stream/Rent/Buy this doc won't disappoint.
B000H7I6CU	2.0	b	I absolutely loved the premier. It was a movie for all genders and ages. I must admit that 'Mater' the toe truck, voice by Larry the Cable Guy, was the best part of the movie. If it weren't for him it wouldn't have been as good. I loved the movie and the showing at LMS was awesome despite the rain.<br /><br />Great Film
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Highly recommended movie for any family and kids great movie during the holiday season.! this will get all the kids in the spirit of Christmas!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	It is a good bargain and will watch the movie during the Xmas holiday during a break.  Supposed to be a Christmas present.  Guess what?  Hubby found it and what is it doing tthere.  He want to watch it and told him - wait for after Christmas Day!<br /><br />Merry Christmas!!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Good price and delivery was on time.  I've enjoyed this dvd and will soon be ordering Season 2.
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	This is an interesting video as you can select English, Mexican Spanish, or Spanish.  I suppose the Mexican Spanish must have diffent accents as well as slang words that vary from Spanish.  Not being a Spanish speaker though I can not attest to this.  My son loves the movie and has been speaking much more Spanish since the past few days of watching this video!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is a heartwarming movie; the story is taken from everyday life. You cry and laught and in the end you are happy with the whole thing.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	"The Half Blood Prince and HP7 have lost the charm and magic of the stories; no one expects the movies to be the same as the books but these leave the viewer (me) cold. I wonder was J.K. Rolling an advisor on these movies?<br /><br />There is no time spent on the death of Dobbie, and many other touching sections of the book that bring the drama of the decision to go after the ""Hollows"" or the Horcruxes.  I found the changes in ""The Half Blood Prince"" totally useless; Malfoy's mother is a complete wreck emotionally because of Lucius' imprisonment and the task set for her son and yet she shows up at Snape's all dressed up in makeup, heels, etc., oh well thankfully it will finally be over in July.  Perhaps in 10 years or so someone like Peter Jackson will take a look and say ""let's do these stories justice"" or not."
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	I've read all the books and seen all the films a dozen times over. I did like Deathly Hallows part I, but I was disappionted at how Hermione and Ron's relationship was so slow to come together. When Ron left and then finally returned, I just wanted Hermione to run and put her arms around him and be happy he was back. It was so depressing and sad. Just kiss and make up for gosh sakes!! I did make my boys cover their eyes of course when Harry and Hermione were in a semi-naked vision of sorts, made by Voldermort to make Ron jealous. All in all I thought it was a good film. It of course is the build up for part II. I recommend watching part I. It was yet another fun and exciting adventure in Harry Potter.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"""Fireproof"" is a wonderful and encouraging movie. A must for all married persons, who really care about their marriage. I would recommend it to everyone."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"About 5 years ago, back when I used to have cable TV, on the Comedy Channel, I happened to see this Comedian on a commercial with the Grumpiest lookin' puppet (Walter) I've ever seen! I'm thinking back then, ""naa, this looks like it's goin'a suck-BIG time! Cut to just about a couple of months ago, a co-worker and I happened to be talking about the best Comedy Routines he has seen-Jeff Dunham and Lisa Lampenilli (Sp?). Just for the hick of it I went to Blockbuster and rented Jeff Dunham's Arguing With Myself and Spark Of Insanity! Good Lord!!!!!!!! I laughed so hard I had to pause the DVD player just to breath and literally catch my breath! Then he brings out Peanut! Geez'US H KEE'Rist I had to go to put Depends on because of the SAW-NA-TA-AH-NA Routine!! PAUSE the DVD player again Dam-it to catch my breath again! Then Peanut starts to crack on some of the poor unfortunate souls who have to deal with physical issues! Stop the DVD again to catch my breath again because I'm laffing so G'Dam hard-then G'dam Peanut starts crackin' on one of the Audience Members-------Had to go change out the Depends! I really like that comment about using these DVD's as greeting cards! Great Great Stuff! When I first saw Peanut on the cover of Arguing With Myself-I'm thinking-""what the hell is that?"" After watching the DVD's for the omp-teenth time--Peanut is definitely MY fav character-then Sweeeeet Daddy D, then Walter! Peanut must have escaped off the set of Sesame Street,gone rogue, abused alot of drugs, and alot of alcohol-but the way Jeff works with Peanut you really have to pinch yourself and say the character is not real! To Jeff-When is your next DVD and Why don't you make an Evil Character from your lovely Wife's Purse!?"
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I am fan of Harry Potter books. I love the movies, but sometime I feel something is missing from the movies. However, this one...so true to the book. The ending make me more eager than ever for the second part. It can be slow but smooth. Not even one bored part in the movie.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Returning with old pals Walter, Peanut, and Jose Jalapeno, Jeff Dunham introduces us to two new characters in his most recent DVD, Spark of Insanity. Most notable is his new character, Achmed the dead terrorist, who is nothing short of a spark of genius! For those who are avid fans as well as newcomers, Dunham's latest is sure to have all rolling hysterically on the floor!
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	great blue ray dvd, excellent video and audio presentation, one the best blue ray discs yet.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My grandson and I both enjoyed this imaginative romp that actually successfully creates amusing characters with affect that match their brand.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was the weakest of the first four films, so I wasn't expecting much from the fifth entry in the series. Therefore HP5 came as a fairly pleasant surprise. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is an acceptable movie adaptation of the darkest book in the series and stands on its own fairly well, too.<br /><br />Some of the important casting was very well done. Sickly-sweet Imelda Staunton does not exactly fit the toadlike description of the book's dictatorial teacher, Dolores Umbridge, but in her own way Staunton is a more than satisfactory nemesis. Fans will love to hate her. Helena Bonham Carter has a brief but crucial role as Bellatrix Lestrange. And Evanna Lynch makes a superbly spacy Luna Lovegood.<br /><br />When adapting a nearly 900-page book (the series' longest) into a barely two-hour movie (the series' shortest to date), a lot of material has to be left out of the final screenplay. In general, director David Yates and writer Michael Goldenberg made some wise decisions in ruthlessly pruning such extraneous events and characters as Quidditch, the children's visit to St. Mungo's Hospital, Dobby, and Luna's family newspaper. The Tonks character's impact was slashed so drastically that she might as well have been left out entirely as well. And Hagrid's tiresome half-brother Grawp could easily have been excluded.<br /><br />The Harry Potter directors have been adequate at directing in the present tense, but where director Mike Newell fell down badly in the fourth movie was in his exclusion of the necessary foreshadowing of certain key future events. For example, he ""treated"" fans to an entirely pointless, made-up dancing lesson conducted by Professor McGonagall (a ridiculously out of character aberration for Maggie Smith's character), but almost entirely left Sirius Black out of the movie. By failing to show Harry's and Sirius's growing importance to each other in the prior movie, Newell made the threat to Sirius in the fifth movie much less weighty.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Yates has not learned from his predecessor's mistake. He entirely writes the Ginny character out of many scenes (in favor of Neville, Fred, and George), and shows Harry developing a rapport with Luna rather than with Ginny. With the next movie in mind, he should have started to develop the Harry/Ginny relationship, as JK Rowling did in the book. And by pruning the important Black family house-cleaning sequence from the fifth movie, Yates has created another awkwardness for himself in the sixth movie.<br /><br />If there is an aspect of the movies that is insulting at times, it is the treatment of the various ethnic minorities. The directors seem unable to see minorities as regular people in contemporary English wizardry whose ancestors happen to come from non-European backgrounds. In the fourth movie, the Patil sisters attended the Yule ball in stereotypical, jarring Indian costume instead of the formal wear that everyone else wore (and that the characters had worn in the books). Similarly here, Mr. Weasley's black co-worker Kingsley Shacklebolt dresses for a rescue mission and then for an average workday in a ludicrously inappropriate parody of what a television version of an African potentate might have worn in 1965. Why can't he just be a black English wizard in ""ordinary"" wizarding robes?<br /><br />If the PG-13 movie falls down at times in the details, its overall tone of darkness does an excellent job of creating a threatening mood. The book's Harry was at times too whiny; the omission of some of Harry's self-pitying rants added to my enjoyment of the story. As usual, the Phelps brothers' portrayal of the Weasley twins provides some comic relief, though I thought that their anti-Umbridge campaign should have been conducted over a longer period of time and should have included some more interesting magic than merely a few fireworks.<br /><br />Yates deserves credit for learning from some of the series' prior mistakes. I hope that in his direction of the sixth movie, he will fully take into account the necessary preparation for the all-important seventh and final film."
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	If you only buy one umd for your psp, get Sin City.  The crisp black and white, and mix of animation and live action look like they were created for the psp.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I hate this workout, and I love it.  I did the P90X workouts, and to be honest, Insanity made them seem easy.  Not to say that P90X isn't great (it was), but this is focused more on cardio and plyometrics, which I hate and is my weak point.  All the more reason for me to get this workout!  I'm on my second cycle of the workout now, and I'll be honest, I could not get through a full workout for the first several weeks of my first try through this.  Definitely not for a beginner or those with a weak will!  If you don't mind sweating profusely in front of a family member or a friend, I'd definitely recommend finding a workout buddy because you'll need the extra motivation.  I got my sister to do it with me through the first two month cycle and it really helped me push longer.  To sum it up, I hate you Sean T!  And I love you :D
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	My favorite book has become my least favorite movie in the series. Director David Yates seemed to borrow from Alfonso Cuaron's style of directing and failed miserably.  Rushed and too short by Potter movie standards, this movie left me scratching my head, wondering what the heck just happened. Two of the strongest female characters in the series, Tonks and Bellatrix, were given nothing more than a few seconds of screentime. Huge disappointment. Daniel Radcliffe, though a good actor, seemed a bit too stretched at times. All of the actors simply look exhausted. Gone was the chemistry of past movies. The writers and directors of the series really have to scramble to play into Rowlings book series, but it only makes the movies more and more lackluster, especially to those who do not read the books (most moviegoers). I miss Cuaron's style, his interpretation of the series was brilliant and cannot be topped in my opinion. I'm not looking forward to the rest of the movie series, since the ending was the biggest disappointment in fiction I have ever known. The only brightside to this movie, Helena Bonham Carter. The few seconds she got onscreen were absolutely brilliant. Other than that, this movie was a huge letdown.<br /><br />And regarding the special 2 disc set - don't waste your money! Seriously, this is one of the worst DVD sets I have ever seen. Buy it used, buy it cheap.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	This was a novel interpretation of the Fairy Tale - not as dark as the original Grimm, but certainly not the sweet interpretation of Disney.  It was fun to watch, particularly to see how they wove in the traditional story elements we all expect to see in a Snow White story.  A fun evening.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I'm married to the uber geek master of the universe. I think he would give Iron Man 10 stars. He's a comic book/graphic novel/sf guru. I hope he writes a review, but here is my take. I very much enjoyed Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. owns the part. It is amazing to watch his character evolve and see the light.  It was a bit violent for me, but the story is excellent with lots of plot twists. The pacing was very good. The special effects for the most part were fabulous and did not take over the plot. There is a lot of humor and just a little romance. This is sure to be the blockbuster start of an awesome summer movie season. Watch to the end of the credits for a peak at the next issue (I mean Iron Man II).
B000H7I6CU	2.0	b	"No one in our family liked this movie.  Mom and Dad didn't like it and neither did our 4 and 6 year olds (boy and girl) -- and we are pretty easy to entertain.  I mean we liked the Curious George movie so how hard are we to amuse?!?!?<br /><br />First:  the movie is overly long (or conversely under plotted)<br />Second: the characterization is missing.  Flat, flat, flat.<br />(The best characters were Tow-mater and the little Italians.  But the two main characters were boring and forgettable.)<br />Third:  wasn't Ellen DeGeneres available to do the voice-over or did she turn it down after looking at the script.<br /><br />As with most kid material, I look to my children's reactions in order to gage how to rate something.  In the case of ""Cars"" I have to say that my two children fidgeted and actually had to be walked about the lobby to reduce the tedium.  It was either that or leave!<br /><br />My daughter, btw, will sit through 2 hours of a Wagner opera so what does that say about the low entertainment value of this movie!?!?<br /><br />Two Stars.  Though the animation quality was top-notch, this was no NEMO, or even Thomas the Tank Engine when it comes to storyline interest.  Buy if you are desperate for rainy day fair, otherwise my small fry advise giving it a miss."
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	It's true. With a franchise as fanatically beloved as Harry Potter, a 3+ or even 4+ hour presentation of 'The Order of the Pheonix' surley would not have lost the studio money? In fact, I am convinced such a long running time would have INCREASED the already bloated box office for this film. The fans would have had MORE incentive to go back and see it again. I have often wondered whether anyone in Hollywood has learned anything from the Lord of the Rings trilogy? (If I had had the money, I would have seen Return of the King daily for ten straight days in the theater.)<br /><br />ADHD culture? No way, with a fine story, the time goes by in a flash. Alas, we'll have to wait for the next great literary saga to be made into properly epic films.<br /><br />Anyway, about this film as it stands. First, MAJOR congratulations to the beautiful Evanna Lynch for her wonderfully dreamy performance as Luna. She made the movie worth watching for me. In fact, the reason I give this film an extra star is because they devote a surprisingly large amount of screen time to her. (Her emotional discussion of loss with Harry near the end was a surprise and delight to see survive the editing process.)<br /><br />Rupert Grint seems to have lost his annoying adolescent voice breaks, and talks and acts worthy of his underrated character. And of course, Imelda Staunton was great as Umbridge. Michael Gambon is a fine actor, but his Dumbledor is not as good humored as his book persona (his lifelessness during the famous escape scene in his office is a case-in-point). Rickman, Radcliffe, Watson, Oldman, Thewlis, Wright, Lewis, and Issacs were all excellent as usual. Ralph Fiennes' Voldemort was actually menacing this time, unlike the silly Hare Krishna he seemed to be in Goblet of Fire.<br /><br />The strong point of this movie is the same as the book: Dumbledor's Army. The scenes where Harry is teaching his classmates the Patronus spell are absolutley wonderful.<br /><br />However, there were some story cuts that were just unforgivable, thus the low rating on my part.<br /><br />First, what happened to THE MIRROR?! If you recall the book, Sirius gives Harry a mirror through which he can communicate with him at any time. Harry, caught up in the stress-fest that is his life, forgets to use it when he senses Sirius is in danger. After Sirius's death, he remembers the mirror, and smashes it in grief. That could have been a powerfully emotional scene in the movie, and I'm at a loss to guess why it was cut. (It would have only added ten minutes to the film, tops!)<br /><br />The second unforgivable cut was Neville's visit to his broken parents at the mental hospital, and Harry+co's reaction. That was a pivotal moment for Neville and would have made the movie's climatic battle with Lestrange (played superbly by Helena Bonham-Carter I might add) more involving.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this film is by far the most enjoyable of the five Potter movies so far. The sets, the score, and the editing were all thrilling. But make sure to read the book again, and especially so if you've never read it, because this is the zenith of the Harry Potter saga in my opinion, before Half Blood Prince put a serious dampener on the series' potential.....
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"The slow, self-assured menace of Javier Bardem's character is riveting to watch. However, since so much of this movie depends on the tension created by Bardem's terrifying, toying deliberation, you might be a little disappointed by what seems to be some unwarranted hastening of the action in certain places. It feels as if a number of scenes were left on the cutting room floor - scenes that we want to see, that we are primed to see by the overall pacing of the movie.<br /><br />For example, there is the scene that was so often used to advertise this movie - the scene in which Bardem's character engages a convenience storeowner in what we clearly perceive is a life-or-death coin toss. When Bardem mockingly calls the storeowner ""Friendo"" and commands him to call heads or tails, we feel that something in particular triggered Bardem's animosity, that the storeowner himself might have presumptively addressed Bardem as ""Friendo."" However we don't see any of what might have led to the showdown. The scene is pretty much limited to just the action shown in the advertising trailer.<br /><br />If one of the reasons we watch thrillers, outside of pure vicarious enjoyment of violence, is to rehearse what we ourselves might do if confronted by extreme threats - then it's important to see the whole development of the threat.<br /><br />One other quibble: the plot's logic fails on a key point. Bardem's character proves to be such an implacable, unerring juggernaut in tracking down whoever stole his drug consignment, we wonder how he so easily lost track of the drug package in the first place.<br /><br />However these minor points aside, ""No Country"" is an absolutely engrossing trip - taken once. When I went to watch it through a second time though, I found I wasn't nearly as involved. I did appreciate having another chance to get to know Tommy Lee Jones' character, with his wonderful, heroic resign. But Bardem's Chigurh character didn't seem as interesting the second time around. Whereas I can watch other Coen Brother's classics such as ""Fargo"" and ""Blood Simple"" any number of times and always find some new fascination with them - this movie didn't seem complex enough to hold up that way.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great movie to rent, but it might not be worth adding to your permanent collection."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	"This is great, very watchable and ""funnier than hell"". Great characters. Perfect to watch with friends. Be sure and get his other DVD. A must have. And go see him when he comes to your town."
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	"This DVD was so funny I bought copies for my (grown) kids.<br /><br />Now they all go around saying ""On a stick"" after anyone introduces them."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	I bought this DVD for my 2.5 yr old granddaughter. I'm taking her on the Polar Express train ride before Christmas and I just wanted to put something in her 'memorie bank' about the trip, as well as help start a tradition for her and me. She is too young to understand the movie but LOVES to look and listen, in between running around. I love the movie as well as the book. Good way to build memories for the 'grands'.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	This is an enjoyable tale capturing the spirit of Christmas that can be enjoyed by all of the family.  It is appropriate even for small children to watch.  We have watched it with our grandchildren when they visit at Christmas time and they love it!
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	This is a well crafted film on all levels. Nevertheless it left me feeling as if someone had emptied the contents of their bowels in my lap. Its slick, taut surface serves to push Cormac McCarthy and by extension the Coen brother's virulent misanthropy to the end. If you think cynicism is good film making then I have an antidote for you: Frank Capra's 1936 subversive screwball comedy, 'Mr Deeds Goes to Town'. It will make laugh, it will make you think and it will make you glad to be alive. Whereas 'No Country For Old Men' merely made me want to go have a good wash.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	I was extremely happy with the quality of this particular purchase.  The DVD was a gift for my Godson.  Even though he is not even 2 years old, he knew the movie's name.  The DVD was flawless.  We were very pleased with the content and presentation.
B002QZ1RS6	1.0	b	I haven't been able to use the workout.  While it plays on my computer here at work, it won't play on my DVD player at home.  I emailed Lorraine Sperrazza twice, heard back from her once but haven't heard back from her with an answer to my second email. My first email stated that I could not play the Fitness DVD, that was before I found out that the entire set doesn't play on my DVD player at home. It's insane for them to think that I can do the work out at work!<br /><br />I also do not want a refund, I really want this program.  Any suggestions?  Can you guys help me instead?  I don't know where to return this so that I can get a replacement.  They obviously have my money...  HELP!!!<br /><br />Johanna
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	Perhaps I heard too much praise for this movie from others before I watched it, but it did not live up to my expectations.<br /><br />While the action scenes were great, the rest of the movie was often slow. The ending action sequence was disappointing. It was action for the sake of action and didn't quite work. My husband and I laughed, not in a good way, at the action scenes in the end and earlier when Pepper Potts helped Tony Stark change the device in his chest. Talk about cheesy.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr was awesome. Jeff Bridges, until the end, which I already mentioned was very good too.<br /><br />Terrance Howard's and Gwyneth Paltrow's characters could have been played by just about anyone. They both have talent but were not used effectively. Gwyneth was treated more like a Bond girl but one with no charisma. Terrance's character was bland. Gwyneth's was too cold and unapproachable. All she seemed to do was to walk around in tight dresses with big high heels. Boring. There was a glimmer of a good actress in there but as played, they could have substituted any model for her role.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	"In the beginning, I was thinking, ""This movie could have a better (musical) score,"" but in the end I was not disappointed. Great movie if you're interested in the evolution and telling of fairy tales or if you just want to spend a couple hours in enchantment. The ending left me in awe, wanting more but knowing that having it would ruin the effect. I just sat there watching and thinking about the movie afterward. Just wow. I highly recommend."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Enjoyable and thought provoking, and I can understand why it is hated by those it skewers!
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Indiana Jones does not disappoint... a little older and more rugged looking Harrison Ford only makes him a more realistic character. Gonna watch it again.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is an unbelievable talent.  Thoroughly enjoyable.  The DVD makes a great gift.

It has changed my thinking completely.  I am considering becoming a vegan.  And I am now checking every food item I buy and if it is made by Monsanto Corporation I will NOT buy it!!<br /><br />I am telling everyone I know about this documentary and sharing what I learned from it.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Great movie. No problems with the packaging. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. Happy to have this movie on Blu-ray.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This was one of the Best series I have watched. At first I didn't think it would be any good and after I watched the first episode I was completely addicted to it. I would recommend these series to anyone and the books a great too.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	When I heard that Warner Brother's was postponing this movie's release I was upset for at least a week. However, now that I have seen it I realize that it was well worth the wait. This is the most amazing book-to-movie ever made. It's even better since it comes from a true masterpiece by JK Rowling and the fact that the director and producers stayed so true to the books originality made me sing with joy. This is a classic and you will not regret watching it at all. It has drama, action, romance and a lot of comic relief. Seriously, this is the most fantastic movie and I applaud every person who helped to create it.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Iron Man is just a flat out fantastic comic book to film adaptation. I had high hopes going in given the amazing critic reviews and I was not let down in any way. Robert Downey Jr. lays down a great performance that easily ranks as one of the best ever in this genre of film. He is funny, smart, cool and just a unique individual. The supporting cast from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeff Bridges are in fine form as well. The main reason I loved this movie so much was the fact that the cheese factor was very low (more like Batman than the cheese heavy Spiderman), not to mention all the cool tech gadgets. The CGI is only used when needed and looks realistic.<br /><br />My entire sold out theater went crazy throughout the movie and I must admit I even did at times. While The Dark Knight looks to be the film to beat this summer, Iron Man is truly a worthy foe. Now bring on the Iron Man 2!
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	This movie is very original and has very good special effects but I believe that it kind of falls short.  The acting in it alright but not good.  Miss Theron did the best acting on this movie.  The ending of this movie was a let down also, I was expecting a big ending but it goes out with a whimper.  I feel overall that this movie is average compared to what is available out there.
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	I enjoyed the series, just wish I had HBO to catch the new shows. Still liked Moonlight better though. Mick and Beth had better chemistry but True Blood has some interesting characters as well. Sam is one. It was worth buying. I'll probably get the second season when it comes out.
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	"Negatives:<br />Miscast. Lots of overacting and exaggeration that made the entire story seem artificial. Stewart was probably cast as a ""Twilight"" marketing look effect.<br />Seen any of these stereotyped, non-creative, Hollywood fantasy before?<br />(1.) Medieval women who have lots of eye liner; manicured eye brows; lipstick; men and women with braided hair. All Hollywood.<br />(2.) Horses with lots of armor including face masks. Hollywood.<br />(3.) Dialogue such as ""She is of the blood."" or ""We mean you no harm!"" Inane, give me a break - Hollywood.<br />(4.) Lots of big fat candles (weren't being made then) that look like they were bought at Target or Wal-Mart. Lots of big flaming bonfires. Hollywood.<br />(5.) Hero tames some wild beast by just being nice to it. Wild beast has the current rage CGI effect of piranha teeth. Hollywood.<br />(6.) Hero jumps on and rides a wild horse (without a saddle, even) like a pro even though she's just spent the overwhelming part of her young life enclosed in a small prison cell. Another white horse. Hollywood.<br />(7.) Fairies, rabbits, butterflies and mushrooms. White reindeer with big antlers standing next to big tree and water.  Hollywood non-creative borrowing on the verge of idea theft.<br />(8.) Sing along, fireside camping of Snow & dwarves. Artificial e.g.no insects to be found. Hollywood.<br />(9.) All the fake synthetic leather clothing that looks like a came out of the prop room from previous similar fantasy period movies.<br />(10.) The now decades old CGI of things being killed then turning into ashes, in this case little broken pieces, when being struck. The now cheap and getting old CGI morphing software."
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"Harrison Ford still has it, Karen Allen still has it but apparently George Lucas and Speilberg doesn't.<br /><br />The plot is pretty loose the Soviets after a great weapon hidden away in a wooden box in a forgotten warehouse. And although the lost ark makes a brief cameo we are instead looking for the contents of area 54.<br /><br />Of course the plot weak as it is plays 2nd fiddle to the ongoing and never ending chase.  We are crashed, sunk, buried, chased and made to dodge the Bomb.  Because the characters are ones we care about it adds to the moments but they seem recycled.  Those moments are great fun but stringing them together do not a great movie make.<br /><br />In the first and 3rd movie the stakes are made clear early, an great battle between good and evil with the world at stake.  Hollywood today being what it is they can't quite bring themselves to make that clear connection when the foes are Communists until very deep in the movie and even then not without the obligatory early ""Red Scare"" scenes to suggest moral equivalence.  Cate Blanchette's performance doesn't help matters, she is as wooden a character as we have ever seen but I suspect a lot of that is due to the writing.  The presence of Marian seems to preclude any kind of relationship or bond forming between Blanchette and Ford (although it did't have to) so instead she becomes a stock villian.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong there are stunning visuals, great stunts, good comedy and Shia LeBouf does a much better job than the critics give him credit for but like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1903654297"">Dr Who Audio Twin CD Loups Garoux (Doctor Who)</a> for the Big Finish Dr. Who audios or the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8QVBK"">Marx Bros.: Go West/The Big Store</a> for the Marx Brothers it is an avg entry in a quality franchise.<br /><br />Still you can't have the whole collection without it and it is enjoyable.  The best way to describe it is like a scene in an old comic book I once had. The JLA finds themself in an alternate universe and when the 40's Superman expresses satisfaction at fighting the Nazi's Green Arrow Comments ""Lets not spoil the man of steel's fun.""  Dr. Fate replies ""Tis not fun tis nostalgia"".  Well the movie is a bit fun but its appeal is largely due to nostalgia.<br /><br />This isn't a bad choice for a movie but Prince Caspin is a better one."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is an excellent movie.  It was well done.  It had an excellent story line and it relevant to this day and time.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	I really enjoyed this movie and it was awesome to buy the digital download before the movie was released. Charlize Theron played and amazing wicked witch and Kristen Stewart was the perfect Snow White.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	"I am sorry, but the story line is'nt complete. The movie doesn't go into the completion of the prophicy. Does Harry Potter live or die? Did the Dark Lord win the battle for survival? ""The Order of the Phoenix"" leaves to many questions unanswered and incomplete."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is really an awesome movie, every married couple of all ages and/or years of marriage need to sit down and watch together.  Great movie.
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	this is one of the best.  seen him live and I couldn't wait to get this DVD. Well worth the money.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Fireproof is an excellent movie for couples. It shows both sides of the story - the husband's perspective and the wife's perspective. It brings in the daily hustle and bustle of life and shows how stressful it can be. This movie will have you going from tears to laughter and back again so many times, but most importantly it gives the Gospel of Jesus Christ and it has a happy ending. It would be great for every couple in America to watch this movie!!!
B00447G29S	3.0	b	"What disappointed me about The Polar Express?  Looking forward to this movie--though I've never read the book--I took my 11-year-old nephew Brandon to see it yesterday evening in Times Square.  He liked the movie, and couldn't stop feeling sorry for the Lonely Boy who fell in the snow while rushing to catch the train.<br /><br />My view: the movie is beautifully drawn, and has some touching moments, but I suspect that it'll never make me cry like other do-you-believe-in-Santa movies like Miracle on 34th Street or even The Santa Clause.  In Miracle, the issue wasn't just believing in Santa but in what he stood for: love, faith, generosity, perhaps even justice and mercy.  In Clause, it was family relations.  In contrast, Polar Express' issue seems limited to just believing in Santa Claus, and perhaps in Christmas magic.<br /><br />Also, the characters are ill-motivated.  Yes, Hero Boy, the main character, is doubting the existance of Santa Claus, but why is that a tragedy in itself (as opposed to, say, losing faith in everything, like Doris Walker of Miracle)?  Lonely Boy says ""Christmas never worked for me?"" but we don't find out why, and I doubt a large candy-striped package would be enough to make it ""work"".  Hmm..maybe it's because Polar Express never challenges commercialism, or society's misuse of Christmas, like the other two movies do.<br /><br />Also, the danger Hero Boy puts himself into just to retrieve Hero Girl's ticket seems uncalled for.  Yes, kids were in danger in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, but there were characters around saying ""No! Don't!""  Maybe Polar Express doesn't have enough character conflict.<br /><br />Or maybe it was too inflated from its storybook beginnings.  Like How the Grinch Stole Christmas, perhaps Polar Express would've worked better as a 30-minute short than as a full-length movie.  Or maybe all the diverse elements: the animated drawings, the expanded plot--just didn't gell well together.<br /><br />Yes, Polar Express is worth watching once or twice, but I doubt I'll fall in love with it."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My son got this movie for Christmas and we have already watched it about 50 times.  The extras are hysterical so make sure to check them out.  We have kids ages 2 to 16 and they all love it!!!
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"""I took out his weapon. Then I took out his other one.""<br /><br />""Now, that's a mighty fine leathercoat your wearin'.""<br /><br />- Hartigan takes down The Bastard, for the second time, while Marv goes coat shopping in ""Sin City""<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez hits the nail on the head with this religously, faithful adaption to Frank Miller's cult comic book of the same name. Miller was very cautious as to whether or not he wanted to bring his comic to the big screen (he had been burned by Hollywood before with ""Robocop 2""). But, it was full steam ahead when Rodriguez brought a CGI animatic of what the film might look like to Miller (the same CGI presentation was used to also lure Bruce Willis to jumping on board)<br /><br />""Sin City"" is much in the same way & inspiration as that of ""Pulp Fiction"" (Quentin Tarantino directs one small scene in the film. A minor debt he owed to Rodriguez, since Rodriguez supplied Tarantino the score to both editions of ""Kill Bill"" for one dollar). If you like ""Fiction"" you'll love ""Sin"".<br /><br />""Sin City"" consists of four stories that are taken a little out of context.<br /><br />The first two stories bookend the film. The first story has to do with a sociopath (Josh Hartnett), with ""Sin City"" segueing into its 2nd story about a cop (Bruce Willis) on his last day on the job, before retiring, trying to catch a child molester he's been after, called The Bastard. The cop gets in over his head when he finds out that The Bastard has family in high places.<br /><br />The 3rd story has a former boxer turned nutcase, by the name of Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is looking for the killer who killed off his favorite & only prostitute, Angel, & getting framed for the whole thing.<br /><br />The final story has a brutal cop and his buddies getting killed by a group of prostitutes, in Prostitute Row, a section of Sin City that is ruled by its prostitutes. The only rule is, is that cops can not be killed for any reason at all. Oops. The leader of Prostitute Row (a scantily clad, Rosario Dawson) & her boyfriend (Clive Owen) try to cover up the whole mess before the authorities arrive. They don't stand a chance.<br /><br />Sin City is shot entirely in green screen & on a soundstage no bigger than a warehouse. The handcuff fight sequence between Marv & the young psycho kid were shot seperately. Mickey Rourke & Elijah Wood never met each other until the films L.A. premiere!<br /><br />The look of the film is jawdropping. It looks exactly like the comic book, panel by panel (for those not in the know, the comic book is in black & white with some elements in color. I.e., a character says he drives a red Cadilac, you will see him drive a red Cadilac, but everything else on the page is B&W). At times I felt as if I was watching the comic book come to life. And it does.<br /><br />""Sin City"" came out in theatres in early April '05 and will most likely be hitting DVD in late July or August, with everything including Marv's bandages thrown in. You'll need' em.<br /><br />With ""Sin City"" already recouping most of its budget expect to see more return trips to the City in the future. I already got my bus ticket."
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"When this movie initially dropped into movie theatres Fall of '07, the hype behind it was not nearly as big as when it was introduced as a competitor in the Academy Awards race, Obviously.<br /><br />This picture is not your average, ""Every detail mapped out, motive and plot is clear-as-glass kind of Flick"". If you're looking for that, rent a Michael Bay film (Transformers, Pearl Harbor)<br /><br />The actors portraying the characters are all on point; the art of acting at it's finest in my opinion. Josh Brolin's role is, for lack of a better phrase, a ""beer drinking redneck"". Quiet as kept, this Vietnam War vet wants nothing more than to smooth out a situation that, in some ways, unexpectedly landed in his lap. The suspense begins when we find out that a homicidal maniac(Javier Bardem) is after that same incentive. Tommy Lee Jones is the rugged Texas Sheriff placing the pieces together as the story unfolds; this role was made for him.<br /><br />As it was put in another review, the principle of the film is ""fate and circumstance"", a signature style of the Coen Brothers. The consequences of the character's actions impact the film greatly, so don't upset yourself at a sudden twist of outcome; this picture displays the fact that resolution and success is not always a likely result, sometimes matters go unsolved and/or astray. I can not recommend this film enough; ultra violent yet never lacking substance. At times it seems to slow, but give it a while as it will definitely pick back up with a new situation. Definite rent and/or purchase."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	John Adams is the best historical drama I have ever seen. It is historically accurate with superb characterization. I highly recommend it.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This has to be the best Marvel movie so far.  It is like reading a well written classic novel.  The movie is well structured from start to finish.<br /><br />I like the way how Tony is casted into different characters in the movie.  What I want to say is that the Ego, Super-Ego, etc. which are part of Tony are being played by different characters in the movie.<br /><br />I have the Blu-ray 2 disc copy.  The movie is great but the extra and two documentaries are kinda boring.  And the BD-Live never works with my PS3.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great movie.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"Ban Stein, funny and smart all at once, takes a hard look at the scientists of evolution, and where there theories lead. The documentary is well thought out and fair letting the scientists answer the question in there own words. Ben never interrupts and calmly asks questions to which the scientists respond with little or no obvious intelligence, and blind faith (Do not say that to them) in evolution. In the end not even these ""men of science"" can agree or give a clear answer, but the conclusion is very clear from them...""No Intelligence Allowed"" or dare I say possessed by them."
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	Well, subtitles only in Spanish. It's regretful for people like me - who can read in English, but can't hear or have problems with it. That's why I am not buying it. Guys, you could do in English too! It's simple nowadays.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	Jeff is amazing in this video.  Need to make plans to see him in person.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Robert Downey, Jr. is terrific as Iron Man. His character, billionaire Tony Stark, builds weapons for the U.S. military. Stark doesn't even realize that it is his own WMD's that are being used for 'evil' until he (spoiler alert) is kidnapped early on by Afghan rebels. Downey is absolutely terrific as Stark. It is the actor's ability to balance humor with drama that actually carries the film all the way through to its' conclusion. The special effects are also dynamite, and the Iron Man suit creation is awesome. The plot has good twists, and there is enough great excitement (in the first hour especially) and light humorous touches that also keep me glued to the screen. Like all movies about good vs. evil, though, there are usually some problems as to how the director defines the 'bad guys'. The action begins in Afghanistan when Stark is kidnapped (no more spoilers, I promise). The men who kidnap Stark are supposedly rebels, and at first they are pretty frightening. But low and behold, when all is said and done, we discover that these 'Arab' rebels are nothing more than more stereotypical villains that we have seen in countless movies before, and they are not very smart, either. You even have the bald, steely-eyed Arab who has murder in his eyes (and lucky for us he speaks pretty good English). As for villains other than the predictable 'Arabic' bad guy, the writers have thrown somebody else into the pot, so that is a relief. Still, I wasn't content with the supporting cast. Terrance Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, does a good job with what he has, which isn't a lot. And the always gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts (Stark's assistant), is engaging to look at. Her light humor and sex-appeal adds a lot to what could've been a heavy-handed story involving all men and action. Unfortunately she seems to have little to do. Every great superhero film that I know of always takes advantage of the 'love interest' (Lois Lane, Mary Jane Watson, etc.). I hope she will have more to do in the sequel. The same goes for Howard. And Jeff Bridges, wearing a bald head and a beard, is excellent as always, and a perfect foil for Downey's Stark. But it is Downey who really holds the film together. And despite the stereotypes and an action-packed ending that gives me pause, or a sense of deja vu, as if I had seen that same ending in some other summer movie last year, and the lack of things to do for Howard and Paltrow (is there some kind of romantic entanglement between Pepper and Tony Stark?), 'Iron Man' really is a great popcorn film. Downey gives us pretty much a 'one-man show', and he is nearly perfect.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	The movie was absolutely entertaining, and the ease in purchasing the movie was optimal. I rated the quality of the movie at 4 stars out of 5, but actually it should be 4.5 out of 5.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"This movie was not on par with Alien(s) and it is my opinion that this movie most closely resembles the first AVP movie in the following manners:<br /><br />1. Poor character development, you don't really care if these people die, and you have no idea why each of them is important.<br />2. Very poor character application - it's just not realistic in any way.  No Scientist would behave the way these people do, let alone NOT KNOW what they're doing on their mission!  If they were presented as miners or some other kind of worker, I could understand their ineptitude.  In any case, this resembles the very poorly executed first AVP movie.<br />3. The storyline has very little weight.  I was not moved, scared, or impressed at any point in the film.<br />4. I found myself saying, ""what the hell is this?"" often, (and not in a flattering manner) throughout the film.<br /><br />In my opinion, this film was made by a person interested in riding the coattails of a reputation, rather than pursuing innovation.  I tried watching it again, and fell asleep before the head was found.  That hasn't happened since I watched the 3rd Star Wars Prequel.<br /><br />Overall, I could not be more disappointed with this film, and the cheap manner in which it has entered the Alien universe."
B00447G29S	1.0	b	I bought the used copy of the 3D version which does include the regular version also, I did everything it said, dark room, TV brightness on high, used glasses properly, but no luck with 3D version coming out any good at all, I googled about this also and saw many complaints that it must be the DVD itself not done correctly in 3D, not even watchable really, unless you want to see double, very faded colors, on and on, look for yourself and save money and do not buy the 3D version.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	The latest installment of the Potter series.  Darker and more brooding than past films.  It won't be long before the main characters will need refreshing due to the increased physical maturation of the main characters.<br /><br />The movie is well done, with excellent special effects and decent acting.  (After all, the actors have had enough practice.)  More of young and older adult fantasy this time due to the darker side of the movie, it is a decent evening's entertainment with familiar scenes and characters.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This was one of the funniest videos I have seen in a while
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	The one thing Iron Man has going for it is Robert Downey Jr who is just perfect for this role. He is a natural and really embodies the character just right. There is wit and charm and appeal. However, I found the movie a tad on the slow side and fairly predictable. There was no doubt in my mind who the 'bad guy' was, and I know nothing about this comic book.<br /><br />This film, though fun at times did not spark my interest like The Dark Knight or even Transformers did. There were boring lulls and nothing particularly interesting to fill the action-less void. Iron Man is certainly a very good comic book movie, far better than many I've seen, but certainly not the best. It will appeal to many, mostly, again, because of the main character's likeability and the very nice special effects the film has to offer.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Good workout, 4 weeks in and not getting easier... Showing gains all ready in weight loss and tone... Can't wait to start the next 4 weeks
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	You gotta get it is all I can say.  Anyone can relate to one of the characters in this DVD.  I'm telling you get it you won't regret it.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"An older Indy (Harrison Ford) and his companions (Shia Lebeouf, Karen Allen, and John Hurt) are on the trail of a hidden city, where they plan to return a crystal skull to its rightful resting place.  In keeping with the Cold War milieu of the 50s setting, they are pursued by a beautiful Russian military scientist who specializes in psychic research (Cate Blanchett).  This iconic 50s window dressing, along with UFOs, A-bomb tests, McCarthyism, and greasers, adds to the fun of this entertaining movie.<br /><br />A lot of people hate this film, as evidenced by the surprisingly low average rating of 3.5.  I'll admit that I was disappointed, too, but it's probably next to impossible to meet expectations that have been building for nearly twenty years.  Some of the action goes way over the top and the sci-fi elements don't mesh well with the Indy universe, but I'd say that this film still comes out ahead of ""Temple of Doom.""  I liked the way they handled Indy's age, and it was fun to see Marion Ravenwood return."
B00447G29S	4.0	b	"fully animated and I think the Chronicles of Narnia may have been better fully animated or at least the Narnia side of it would have underlined the difference between our world and Narnia. I loved the strong African American female lead in this one.  She is so confident! Tom Hanks as the conductor has a bit of a mean streak that I didnt like, I was expecting ""good cheer"" at Christmas.  I think the anxiety and disbelief comes out very well in the boy lead (also played by Tom Hanks I think).  He has been lied to far too often and he no longer believes luckily for him in his world Santa is still real wheras in ours the original Saint Nick is long dead. The boy who ""knows everything"" was a bit annoying.  It makes me sad to see people with knowledge portrayed as annoying.  Unusual but good for a change of pace."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I was just glued to the chair without blinking my eyes. One of the greatest gangster thriller (if not greatest suspense) of 2000's. Full of twists and turns.What a gripping rollercoster ride.Caprio should have won best actor for this movie. Fantastic direction of Martin and excellent screenplay. The language is brutal but not surprising when you actually see the street gangs these days. The violence is disturbing but realistic. Balwin is humourous. Marting sheen symbolizes goodness. Jack Nicholson may have overacted a bit and looses the Boston tempo he shows in the beginning but who can complain about him.<br />  This brutal move is Not recommended fo pure hearts.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	The item was in good condition when I received it, but I gave it as a gift, so I am not 100% sure that the DVD is okay.  I assume the person I bought it for has watched it; that person has not complained to me.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"There's a reason that ticket sales are down some 30%. Hollywood producers haven't caught on that moviegoers are not pawns who will run out and see every Ashton Kutcher formulic comedy or some forgettable horror film. As a college student I can safely say this is the biggest cult movie to come around since Fight Club. Cinematically gorgeous in a way that a 200 million dollar Lucas epic could never imagine. Maverick acting by Rourke and Willis, who apparently refuse to become washed up. Perfectly directed and ""chopped""- there is never a dull scene. Overall, a five star film that through all of the excess manages to evoke real human feeling. Granted, it wont cross generational lines for obvious reasons, however, for the college kids of America, this is high art. Kudos Rodriguez, I forgive you for the Spy Kids trilogy."
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This dvd of Jeff Dunham was probably one of the funniest video's I have seen in a long time, I don't think I have ever laughed so hard, whenever we have company over, we play it for them, and they get a big kick out of watching it....I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves comedy.
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	"I purchased this dvd on the advice of a friend. I am a believer and my husband is currently not.  While the movie itself seems to simplify the trials of real life, after watching it, I myself began to hope in the reality of such a life.  I was inspired to believe that happy endings are possible.  At the very least, you'll walk away from watching this movie, with that ""feel good"" feeling.  It may however, inspire you to believe that things can be better between you and your spouse and to work toward that goal."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"This is a must have for your collection. I don't even like this movie that much. I think it's one of Pixar's weaker films. Of course Pixar is always good quality entertainment, so even a weaker film by their standards is better than all that unwatchable CGI nonsense from other companies. We can talk about the cliched storyline of the arrogant city slicker driving into an old, beat up town populated with goofy characters all day. It wouldn't matter. The movie is a total cliche, he learns his lessons about life and not being selfish, he wins the affection of the ""girl car"", he inspires the old champion racer to reconnect with the world again, his goofy sidekicks rebuild their town and get back to grooving, whatever... It's not a great story.<br /><br />The story and characters are second rate but the visual quality of this movie on Blu-Ray will make your jaw drop! I watched Ratatouille on Blu-Ray first and was mightily impressed but I knew Cars would take the cake as a demonstration disc on account of Cars being very colorful. It exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Watch the scene when the main character ""Lighting McQueen"" gets into that transport truck and they drive out of the stadium and across the freeway of the city at night and then across the highways of the Southwest in the day. ""Life is a Highway"" is the musical cue during this scene. The visual scheme is gorgeous, lifelike, 3-Dimensional with an extreme sense of depth perception. It looks like real life even though it's a CGI animated film!<br /><br />I watched Cars using a PS3 connected via a standard HDMI cable to a 42 inch, 1080p LCD TV by LG. Every person who has seen this kind of quality has been very delighted as the reviews here demonstrate and so will you!<br />WALL-E is going to look drop dead gorgeous when it comes out. I saw WALL-E at the movie theater, on a massive screen with digital projection. It looked great. It will be eye poppingly awesome on Blu-Ray too. Until then, you've got Cars and Ratatouille. Enjoy!"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"My 2 year old has a short attention span but when it comes to watching""Red Car"" he will contently sit and watch the whole movie.  We bought it for road trips and now it has become a staple in our home."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	i love this workout. i haven't done the diet with it but the workout alone has resulted in improvements (lost inches).  the calendar takes the guess work out of which DVD to use in the morning. who can think coherently at 0600 hours?  thanks shaun T
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	It's a blockbuster and one of the best comic book movie adaptations ever -- it's a fun popcorn flick!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Received the order ahead of schedule. All items intact and properly packaged. This is one of the best movies ever - great value too.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie is a great tool to help us all<br />see how we can get back on track with our<br />significant other, how we can Check ourselves<br />and our actions. it is a great tool for the<br />married couple ministry and a great movie to<br />watch at home it is not boring an awesome work.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	A friend told me about Jeff Dunham, she watched him on the Comedy Channel.  I immediately came to Amazon to find the DVD.<br /><br />I have never laughed so hard in my life.  To say that Jeff Dunham is funny just is not enough.  His talent is amazing.  I tell ya, those puppets of his are real and alive!<br /><br />Can't tell you how many times we have watched it and every time we laugh harder than the time before.<br /><br />Great entertainment.  Just make sure you are not eating or drinking anything while watching it.  It may end up all over you.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	This is the best series HBO has put out since they canceled all the good ones (Sopranos, Deadwood, ROME) lets just hope they aren't dumb and cancel this one too. (A third season was picked up for 2010).
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	"""How much of a man's life is lost in waiting."" laments one of the key characters in the return of Dr. Henry (""I named the dog Indiana"") Jones Jr. For the record, it's been nearly a decade since Messrs. Lucas, Spielberg and Ford rode Indiana Jones into the sunset for his (next-to) Last Crusade. So, does the latest installment featuring our favorite near- indestructible professor of archeology make the grade? - For every minute of its all-too-short 123 minute run time -- trust me.<br /><br />Seconds after the Paramount Logo once again morphs into scenery (in this case, the mound over a prairie dog's burrow), you know you are entering Dr. Jones' territory. In this case, nuclear-test-site Nevada in 1957 - a time when America was an I-like-Ike, I-hate-commies, Howdy-Doody watching, Elvis is here-to-stay kind of place. Our first glimpse of our hero shows us a man already in trouble. The Soviet bad boys outnumber him about fifty to one, and for a twist, the baddest red boy is a red girl - Colonel Irina Spalko. Indy's unique skills are forcibly put to use to find an artifact (of sorts) that will lead both good and bad (a few of which are ugly) on a quest for more than fortune and glory that ends at a place where living Mayan folklore forces the science out of archeology and makes fiction fact.<br /><br />Sound familiar? - You bet it does. In fact, this film goes out of its way to make the viewer feel comfortable with not only the present characters and quest - but also gives more than a passing nod to characters and quests that have already been. During the film's opening encounter in a top-secret army hangar where the government crates its most valuable secrets, we conveniently catch a glimpse of Indiana's prize from his first great adventure. Photographs, both of Marcus Brody, Indy's museum curator associate and father Henry Jones Sr. are framed on his desk at home. During a moment when Dr. Jones first meets young Mutt Williams, who looks to him to help a mutual friend, Sean Connery's Oscar-winning take from The Untouchables, finds itself nicely rescripted, ""Looks like you've brought a knife to a gun fight"". Better yet, Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones quotes Harrison Ford as Han Solo! - ""I've got a bad feeling about this."" - during one of the film's several exciting set pieces.<br /><br />Talking about excitement, this film should leave no doubt as to Stephen Spielberg's unparalleled brilliance in staging action sequences. I'm not going to nit-pick about when and where the digital world begins and whether it was under or over used - but I will say that the clich&eacute; ""edge-of-your-seat"" is exactly what an elaborate chase through the South American jungle generates. This nearly twenty minute thrill-ride is packed with moments that bring us the best of no less than three actioners - Zorro, Tarzan and the Great Escape - all for the price of one ticket to the Amazon.<br /><br />To its credit the film takes none of the magic away from Indiana Jones while keeping him almost as mythic as the antiquities he seeks. Yet, the film does not try to overlook the nature of growing old. ""We've reached an age where life stops giving you things and starts taking them away"" remarks a colleague to Dr. Jones early in the film. Lucky for us, Harrison Ford breathes new life into Indy and he is no less than equally supported by the skill of all the film's key players. Cate Blanchett's take on Russian-spy-nastiness never goes over-the-top to ""Boris and Natasha"" parody. Shia LaBeouf is more than adequate as Mutt - in fact, he's good - there, I said it. Ray Winstone plays a fellow relic-hunter with enough mystery that keeps us guessing as to his character's loyalties almost until the film's end. Unfortunately I thought that both John Hurt and Jim Broadbent - although well-cast were much underused in the proceedings. Then there is the return of Karen Allen - More than twenty five years since her first appearance as Marion have done nothing to diminish the twinkle in her eye and the sincerity of her smile. Her performance once again puts the chemistry ahead of the archeology in Marion's screen time with Indy.<br /><br />This chapter in the saga of Indiana Jones series secures 2nd best. Youll enjoy it to bits with more action than ever good humour and good ending with good use of the new age and times eg fords age and the cold war. It does act as a tribute and youll only moan at it if your a really annoying picky critic admittedly a bit much cgi."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This was one of the funniest stand-up acts I have ever seen.  I laughed until I cried.  Walter, as always, was hilarious but when you add in Achmed the dead terrorist and Peanut and Jose Jalapeno on a Stick(let's not forget Melvin the super-hero), you have nothing but laughs beginning to end.  Even the bonus features will keep you laughing
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	I liked the movie. Prometheus is not as good as the original Alien movie, but good enough. My question: is it going to be an extended version released on bluray or the original theatrical release? I've heard rumors that extended version was what Ridley Scott wanted, but theaters wanted a shorter version (about 20 - 30 min shorter).
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Dunham is great and the uncut version is better then any comdy central special ever could be.  I have both of his Disc and can't wait for the thrid one that is supposed to be released soon.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. ""Sin City"" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes ""Sin City,"" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike ""Sky Captain,"" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three ""Sin City"" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is not quite a ""Kill Bill"" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. ""Sin City"" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. Outstanding."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"This movie about an individual's transformation can guide people to happier and healthier relationships.  I saw myself in this film at different stages of my marriage.  I didn't have the film's 40-day-steps to guide me through rebuilding myself, but the humbling of a failed relationship did bring me closer to God, family and self, my true self.  Once my faith relationship was restored, all other relationships seemed effortless. ""Fireproof"" strongly teaches us how to see ourselves and others as God see us.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend to any couple at any stage of their relationship to sit down together and watch this life saving film.  I say life because there's so much more in this movie than just a lesson in making a marriage work.  The real relationship that is reconciled in this movie is a relationship with the Almighty.<br /><br />If your relationship with God, family and friends is going well, then you might enjoy watching this movie for confirmation of what it took to make them successful. If you've committed to a relationship but things haven't been what you thought they would be, check out this movie and see if it addresses your doubts. ""Fireproof"" just might shed some light on where the love you thought you had for God or another person was misplaced or misled by you. And you'll be surprised at the place this movie points you toward in finding it.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this movie so much that I'm taking it with me on a trip to visit family.  I feel its definitely a movie to be shared and talked about.  It touches while it teaches!"
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I have not read any of the Harry Potter books and so look at each of the films without knowing how they were adapted from page to screen.  As with any adaptation, there will be parts of the story that are changed or removed.  Part one of the final film is quite dark as Voldemort's power dominates the wizarding world. Harry, Ron and Hermione vow to find and destroy all of the Horcruxes in order to kill Voldemort but they have little idea how to accomplish this.<br /><br />The film follows the battle between the forces of good and evil with evil winning. There are systematic efforts to get rid of wizards that do not agree with Voldemort's notions of pure blood.  Dumbledoor's supports are hunted down.  There are broadcasts where the names of captured or killed wizards are announced. The lack of hope pervades the film as Harry, Ron and Hermione are forced to hide in remote places. The locations chosen for their hiding places were visually stunning.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe turns in a good performance as does Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, who shows a broader range of emotions in this film.  This film centers more on the characters of the three central wizards and they carry off the film very well.  They are supported by a host of British actors that mostly make very brief appearances. Bill Nighly has a brief part as Rufus Scrimgeour, but it is a pivotal one as he provides Harry, Ron and Hermione with items that can help them find the Horcruxes.  Imelda Staunton briefly reprises her role as Dolores Umbridge.  Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Isaacs were, as always, very good being evil.  In addition, Dobby makes a substantial appearance again appearing to help Harry in his time of need. The animation of Dobby (and the elf Kreecher) was much more life like than I recall from previous films.<br /><br />I did find that the film was a bit slow as Harry, Hermione and Ron hide out trying to discover what to do next.  These scenes added to the tense atmosphere of the film but were too long.  The suggestion was made by one reviewer that the movie is following the book on this point but on screen, it didn't quite work for me.  On the other hand, the scene where polyjuice is used to create multiple Potters is one of the delights of the film and adds a bit of humor to the serious trouble Harry is in.  I thought the animation that told the story of the Deathly Hallows was well done. The music by Alexander Desplait very much added to the mood of the film.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Buy it! This is a must for all fans or even 1st buyers.<br /><br />This version is really worth your buck.The movie needs no further introduction.The dvd has been lovingly put together and the technical brilliance of this film will blow your senses away!<br /><br />BUY IT NOW!
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	The special effects were good. Charlese Theron was outstanding. Kristin not so much. They should have chosen someone else to play snow white.
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	I bought this for myself and several of my friends. The program was difficult from the word GO. and though it looked exciting at first... i soon realized how much strain it was putting on my knees, ankles and even my thighs. I exercise regularly and do not have any muscle ache issues but this one left me NOT SORE but actually injured and I just had to stop. anyways my friends stopped this too after a few days because of one reason or another. IN short, buy some other program probably p90X but not this one. you can get seriously injured.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	"Jeff was my inspiration to get started and I'm so happy with my ""otto"" dummy and love to entertain!!!!!!!!!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Insanity is amazing!!! I just finished the 1st month's workout and I see incredible results. My thighs, stomach, butt, and arms have toned up so much. This is the hardest and best workout thus far. Insanity is definitely INSANE. Insanity is worth the money. I am a witness.
B0065AVWGU	3.0	b	That was a strange yet intriguing film. But I have to agree with my husband, it could have been shorter. It became dull after awhile. Maybe I'm just too old to really appreciate such movies. It just seemed to be a violence filled gore fest. I like a little more plot than a live action comic book film noir.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"What can I say... this movie amounts to the raping of Indiana Jones.  It reduced the once beloved character to a money making whore.  The plot for those that have not seen the movie takes a turn that is not even based in reality leaving a sour taste.  It doesn't take a realistic or even plausible stance on the mission Indiana is on.  For those who love the old movies or even the young Indiana Jones Chronicles the charm of those movies/shows were that there was a semblance of reality.  You sat there and said: ""This could really happen"" or ""Wow, I wonder if there really was a secret plot like that by the Nazis.""<br /><br />The updated foe, the Russians works fine because the story had to advance 20+ years but you really never get that feeling like they are out for that one piece of lore that will give them that final piece for world domination.  It rests on development or lack thereof of the villains.<br /><br />The introduction of Shia Labeouf is a smart choice but how and who he ends up being is a questionable choice.  Not to ruin who he is to everyone involved, it is his back-story that leaves me wondering are they trying to go the route of Bourne or the new Bond films; reducing him to the newbie or raw agent type, who uses his street smarts and fists before he uses his brain.  Shia's character is a drop out which takes the sequel options in another direction because the charm of the old movies was that Indy was an academic first and an adventure second.  Being an academic drove Indy and I think Shia's character has a long way to go if there are to be sequels.<br /><br />But even with the negatives which there are many; the movie is fun.  The ending is disappointing but the ride there is pure popcorn fun.  Suspend your desire for your parents' Indy (old movies) and welcome in Indy 2008: CGI and aliens.<br /><br />Let's hope that the next one and there will be a next one brings the franchise back to its roots so that Shia can take over an awesome franchise that hasn't forgotten what made it great."
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	After the extended cuts presented in volumes 1 and 2 of the ultimate edition releases (which are indeed the only reasons I began collecting the ultimate editions), volumes three to six are incredibly disappointing. If you do not own the films, or do not own them on blu-ray, the ultimate editions may be worth purchasing and for this I am giving it an extra star beyond the first. However, the precedent set in the first 2 releases leaves this one so incredibly disappointing that I feel I was cheated out of my money when I ordered volumes 3-6 to watch before the DH2 premiere.
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	This DVD features both the bleeped and un-bleeped recordings of<br /><br />this performance.  The bleeped version is of course what has been<br /><br />aired on TV.  Both versions of this performance on DVD also<br /><br />include some additional scenes that were spliced into the<br /><br />televised version.  In my not so humble opinion, these added bits<br /><br />didn't add much that was actually laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />The commentary track is a mixed bag.  Overall it seems a bit<br /><br />amateurish.  There is some interesting information about how<br /><br />Dunham came to create his characters, stories about some of his<br /><br />early experiences, and a few observations about the performance<br /><br />featured.  But the commentary is uneven and is poorly recorded.<br /><br />On the other hand the included out-takes, and the bonus snippet<br /><br />of Peanut's encounter with the family dog are very funny, so<br /><br />there is at least a few 'extras' that are more than just filler<br /><br />on the DVD.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you have never seen this on TV, then all these<br /><br />carps are immaterial since the performance itself is very very<br /><br />funny and well worth watching and having.  Or even if you have<br /><br />seen this on TV, you'll no doubt enjoy watching this performance<br /><br />again and having the opportunity to share it with friends.  But<br /><br />if you're buying this with the expectation that you're going to<br /><br />get a *lot* more funny material beyond what you saw on TV, you're<br /><br />probably going to be somewhat disappointed.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Awesome product. Can't wait for season 2 to come out on dvd. Seller shipped it fast.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"One of the best movies of 2005, Sin City has action, horror, and spectacular visuals; all you need is a strong stomach and a twisted sense of humor.  I've never read the graphic novels, so I won't be doing a comparison to those, just a review from a happy moviegoer who loves it when style and substance meld together to form a visual treat like Sin City.<br /><br />The plot is simply mayhem and revenge, cops and criminals, in a dark world of concrete and sin.  There's lots of blood, Tarentino style, but most of it is in black-and-white so it cuts down on the squishiness.  The plot is not what you want to buy this movie for.  Buy it for the absolutely spectacular and stylized photography and visuals, and the stunning performances of the cast.<br /><br />Bruce Willis aptly and perfectly plays Hartigan, with his ""Diehard-deadpan"" style.  Mickey Rourke is legend in Sin City as Marv, I doubt you will recognize him at first.  The hardest, baddest, meanest, toughest, most vile criminal on the streets, and someone you can root for.<br /><br />Clive Owen (King Arthur) puts his arrogantly serious handsomeness to work as Dwight, a man not to be messed with.  Dwight's Valkyrie, Rosario Dawson (Kids, Alexander) as Gail, gives a stellar (and stimulating) performance in naughty lingerie and a deadly attitude.  Benicio Del Toro (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, Traffic) is excellent as Jackie Boy, a bad cop with a bad heart and a bad attitude.<br /><br />Nick Stahl (Bully, Terminator 3) is awesome.  If you liked him in Bully, you will love him in Sin City as Roark Jr, later to become the golem-like yellow freak.<br />And who can ever get enough of Rutger Hauer? (Blade Runner, Flesh and Blood, Ladyhawke, The Hitcher, etc)  Not me.  I love Rutger, and as Cardinal Roark, those deadly, cold, ice-blue eyes are soulfully used.<br />Elijah Wood (LOTR, Final Destination, The Faculty) is excellent as the psychotic, creepy Kevin; a part that you can just tell Elijah had fun with.  Jessica Alba (Dark Angel) can't act, but doesn't have to in the pretty part of Nancy.  Hats off to Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile, The Scorpion King) as Manute and Devon Aoki as Miho.<br /><br />Sin City uses voice-over narration, a third party telling of the action you watch on the screen.  This movie is as good with the sound off as it is with the sound on.  Filmed mostly in black-and-white, the photography is reminiscent of Schindler's List, though 'List' used only one small splash of color and Sin City uses a bit more, the use of color is still limited to such minute and clever spatterings that the impact is still heavily felt.<br /><br />Using over-the-top violence, impossible feats of heroism, strength, agility, and prowess (Watch for Marv's driving scene and Miho's flying archery) and some very black humor, Sin City achieves a horror aficionado's Zen-like state of almost-nirvana.<br /><br />Really, forget the plot.  It's the photography, cast, acting, FX, costumes, stylization, props, and atmosphere that, alone, bring Sin City to five stars and beyond.  Sin City is a must-buy movie.  Enjoy!"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Cars is another winner for Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios. Since the release of TOY STORY in 1995, they have not disappointed in any of their films (I've yet to see Cars 2, Ratatouille and Brave), except A Bug's Life, infusing their movies with not only top-notch talent, but also great stories with very strong positive messages about friendship and family. And of course, the animation is always stunning.<br /><br />Sadly, this would be Paul Newman's final movie before his death. The legendary actor starred in many films, including The Sting, Exodus, The Color Of Money (for which he won an Academy Award) and Road To Perdition. Good way for a terrific actor to make his final bow.<br /><br />Rated G.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	If you really like the Harry Potter movies then I suggest the book series as well. You will get a better understanding of the characters and how the relationships which occur between them. But overall this movie is pretty action packed and a very entertaining show. I can't wait for the next one!
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I love the whole series and can't wait for the two remaining films.  Thank you for making them available to me.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	None of the Harry Potter movies have really done justice to the books, but this is the worst by far. No character development whatsoever, so many scenes cut that it's hard to tell what's going on, and the scenes that do exist go by so quickly that I feel like I'm watching a movie trailer. Why are they even bothering if this is the best they can do?<br /><br />The bottom line is this. Trying to turn a novel, any novel, into a movie is a stupid idea. Everybody please stop. You will never, ever do it justice.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"I don't really want to talk a lot about this movie because I could spoil the effect. Instead, I'll talk about this filmmaker's first movie. THE SIXTH SENSE, also by M. Night Shyamalan. I first saw it in December 1999, on a 20-hour flight from Chicago to Hong Kong. My only flight out of the USA. The film really pulled me in, which I suspect is particularly difficult on an airplane.<br /><br />Then, the ending. Based on the article you just read, we can say that some viewers weren't surprised. Me, I was blown the heck away and wanted to see it again. Years later I finally did. I taught movie classes, this is a film I chose, and I saw it about a dozen times, fully aware of the ending. It had a bit more going for it than that.<br /><br />My only complaint is with people who think Bruce Willis was the star. The star is Haley Joel Osment! I may have missed out on ""the surprise ending"" because I was watching the kid instead of the shrink. Bruce Willis could probably star in a few more movies after he died and we'd never notice. But I digress.<br /><br />THE VILLAGE is about a pilgrim-style village. Some place quaint, rural, close knit and low tech. Nobody from the village goes into the surrounding woods lest they encounter Those We Do Not Speak Of. The acting was flawless and the scenery most certainly created a mood. Shyamalan is a masterful writer, director and producer. But I had trouble caring about what happened to his characters.<br /><br />That could've been my fault. Saturday morning at 8, Jan was working, and my goal for the day was to pack for our impending move but I was too drained to begin. The neighbor had loaned us this DVD back in February, so I figured watching it and returning it to him was a good start.<br /><br />(The same bad attitude that I brought to THE SIXTH SENSE, right? One of these days I'm going to watch a Shyamalan movie in the right frame of mind.)<br /><br />""The ending."" How would you like to be a filmmaker judged solely on ""the ending?"" In the case of THE VILLAGE, it worked for me. I thought about this film for days after seeing it.<br /><br />Actually, I was trying to decide what to write in this review. How about this?<br /><br />""Shyamalan is a filmmaker of bold originality surviving in a commercialized medium.""<br /><br />That's a good thing, no matter what your opinion of each individual film is. I believe some critics are panning him, but I'm not panning this one. I'm glad I saw it. I've missed a few films between THE SIXTH SENSE and THE VILLAGE, and there will be more after THE VILLAGE. I'll watch them all."
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Good movie. Sorry I waited for dvd should have seen it at the theater. Buying it online was easy and now its always there. The should have offered a rental option.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Saw this on a transatlantic flight from Europe.  A great film.  A great cast.  Had to have it in my library of Myths, Legends and Fairy tales.  Not all great movies are Disney.
B000S5KGH4	4.0	b	I saw Jeff Dunham about fifteen years ago on TV, but can't remember where, or what show he was on. After picking up this DVD, it was apparent what I had missed all these years. After about twenty viewings of Arguing With Myself, the DVD still makes me laugh. Almost everything on this DVD is side-splittingly hilarious, and there is the option to view it with or without the naughty language. It's apparent that Jeff has taken great time and effort to give his characters separate and distinct personalities, so that none of the characters seem even vaguely alike, answering the same questions very differently. However, The shots of Sweet Daddy D (with annoying voice-overs) are the only bad point on this DVD. Fortunately, after Sweet Daddy D has his time on stage, we do not have to see any more of him until the closing credits, which gives us the chance to see and hear the wonderful insanity of Peanut, and the interplay between Peanut and Jose Jalapeno. Great stuff.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"Cars is another winner from the combined efforts of Disney and Pixar. Anyone who watches this movie will be able to relate to a character, from the spiteful Hudson Hornet/Doc Hudson to the easygoing Mater. A star studded cast of voice actors gives this film recognizable voices for anyone. Some of the actors are: Paul Newman (one of my favorites in this film), Owen Wilson (Marley and Me, Drillbit Taylor, Night at The Museum), Larry the Cable Guy, (another one of my favorites) and John Ratzenberger, who has appeared in all the Pixar film and plays his most prominent role in this one. The general gist of the movie is a stuck-up rookie racecar, namely Lightning McQueen, getting arrested in a small Route 66 town called Radiator Springs, where life is mostly about trying to passing through tourist to buy something from one of the characters stores. Over the course of the movie, you find that the town doctor was the best racecar around in his younger days, but had a big crash that ended his career. He know does not want anything to do with the racecar that comes to town. McQueen learns the importance of slowing down and enjoying the ride on the Highway of Life. He helps everyone in the town, and even restores the 60's neon lights in the town. Also, he falls in love with the town attorney, a 911 Porsche. But the best part is the end, when McQueen has a chance to win the Piston Cup, but instead helps one of the greats (called ""The King"" in the movie and modeled after Richard Petty's Plymouth Firebird and voiced by Petty himself) finish his final race. This movie has the best moral of any of the Pixar movies. An added bonus is all the retro cars, from a Model T to a 50's Chevy Impala. Plus there are some great punch lines as with all the Pixar movies. I've saved the best part of this movie for last. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring Rascall Flatts, Sheryl Crow, and Brad Paisley, I would rate it as one notch below the soundtrack of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006GAOGI"">Rocky IV</a>, which has the best soundtrack of all time. Overall this is a phenomenal film. HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!!!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	A new product was shipped free of charge when no used products were available. I am very pleased and will look for this company in the future.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"Ben Stein presents his case well.  You really understand after this movie why Darwin's theory for the origin of species is just that, a theory.  It cannot be called science because it does not fulfill the requirements of the scientific method (theory/hypothesis, observation, experimentation and conclusion).  The theory of evolution has evolved from theory to ""fact"" according to some ""scientists"" in the film; however, no fact is established without experimentation and there has been not one yet that has substantiated any theory.  Therefore, all opinions on our origins are faith-based, period.<br /><br />As far as evidence pointing one way or the other, Ben does an excellent job of going from point A to point B in a logical progression.  If evolution is a fact that explains our origins, then it should be able to answer some basic questions and it cannot.  Ben starts asking questions which lead to more questions until the whole thing begins to unravel right before the viewer's eyes.  Evolution as science is exposed as a myth.  It is supported by persons who hold a world view that dictates how they will view any ""evidence"" they find. It is quite likely the same holds true for those examining ""evidence"" from an intelligent design perspective but at least those interviewed in the film were honest about it.<br /><br />One item that was almost laughable was when a ""scientist"" stated that it was known how abysmal the education is in America and what was certainly not needed was for creationism to be included as ""science"" in the classroom.  Apparently, he didn't recognize the contradition.  Creationism is currently excluded and the education system is currently a disaster according to his own admission.  You will want to hear it in his own words.  Of note is that these scientists (I can't consider them such after listening to them in this film) insisted throughout on equating intelligent design with creationism.  Intelligent design could lead to creationism as defined in the Bible but it could also lead elswhere so to insist so dogmatically that the two were equivalent was disingenuous.  The difference between ID and creationsim was made clear in the film.<br /><br />Other blunders appear in officious sounding jargon from the various scientists.  Ben doesn't say much.  He just let's them bury themselves with their own words.  I started to feel sorry for them after a bit.<br /><br />You might find that this movie is disturbing on several levels, especially the connection to Nazi Germany, eugenics, and other rather nasty atrocities foisted on the weak of society all masked as necessary and noble.  Another disturbing implication is the loss of freedom and death the victims suffered as a result of ""superior"" minds having decided what was for the ""best"" where they were concerned.  Ben doesn't blast you with it, but he certainly lets you get the picture.  Our beliefs WILL dictate how we view others and how we will subsequently treat others.<br /><br />A lot of information put together in a very easy to follow ""ask a question and try to get a plausible answer"" step by step process to the final conclusion.  ""Expelled"" is excellent."
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	"You know the feeling when you come in late in a movie - say miss the first 5 minutes?  You never feel like you've caught up with the plot.  You feel frustrated and confused the entire time.  You want to ask someone, ""Who are these people, what are they doing, and why are they doing it?  What did I miss?""<br /><br />That's how I felt with this movie.  Since I was watching the DVD, obviously I didn't come in 5 minutes late, but it felt like it.  I felt I had missed part of the plot, and never quite caught up with the story line.  I believe the cut scene at the start, when Harry is talking with his aunt, would have helped, but it still might have felt this way.<br /><br />None of the others did this.  I always felt I came in at the beginning, and was able to follow the plot.<br /><br />This movie has to be watched if one is going to have any clue at all when Part II comes out, but I was (for the first time in the series) very disappointed.<br /><br />No, I haven't read the books.  However, one should not have to read the books to understand the movies.  They should be true to the books, but not depend on them for comprehending the plot."
B0032CNOK6	4.0	b	"In the 50 years I have studied science and the methodology,thereof, discovering many of the points put forth in this humorous documentary  I have come to a number of similar conclusions.  How long did the ""scientific community"" burn people at the stake for saying the world is not flat and that the sun does not revolve around the earth. We need to Open our minds and quit functionally burning people at the stake and look for an answer to the question not a question that fits an answer. Time to be ""big scientists"" now, we  have had a hundred years to prove ""the earth is flat"", lets put the 1800's behind us and figure it out. Maybe there is more than just Darwin to show changes through time...photochromic materials were discovered by an observant janitor at DOW chemical (Dow / Corning )disposing of post-utilized solutions in a dumpster; implantable plastics began with PM-MA, (poly methyl methacrolate) made by the Ford motor Corporation. It was utilized in fighter plane canopies in WWII; when pieces became embedded in pilot's bodies, there was no reaction, ergo all the implantable plastics to date. It is also utilized for the center ""plastic"" layer of laminated windshields of 99% of cars (CR-39) that holds windshields together in the event of breakage, preventing large sharp shards of glass causing enormous injuries, as well blocks `80% of uv radiation bombarding the body with its devestating affects.  Who'da thought these materials would have the impact they did on society if someone wasn't allowed to ""run with the ball"".  Believe it or not, letting this body of science continue may make the point, the supposed point of real science, indisputable or better yet, create (no pun intended) new areas of more definable research.

B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I purchased this product for my husband for Christmas $50 bucks cheaper than on the insanity website.  I thought I was purchasing a used product but the videos came in their original packaging.  I was also very pleased with the timliness of the shipping.  I was s little nervouse that the videos wouldn't get here before Christmas and was tempted to purchase the expedited shipping but I decided not to and was glad.<br />Now my husband needs to start using the videos!  We have P90x and are very pleased, I'm sure insanity will be just as good or better.  Excellent way to stay in shape or condition for something.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"Let's be brutally honest, folks:  Kristen Stewart may have achieved ""movie star"" status, but she's definitely a mediocre actress with a limited range, relying on soulful looks and lovestruck TWILIGHT fans to validify her screen leading roles--a media fixture whose future impact will most likely fade when the vampire saga breathes its last!  Charlize Theron on the other hand is mesmerizing as the evil Ravenna.  When Theron's on screen, this movie takes fire and you can't take your eyes off her.  Her Oscar-winning stature is not denigrated in an otherwise average film.<br />SNOW WHITE is sumptuous to view, capturing the grim fairy tale ambience effectively.  James Newton Howard's score is excellent and the effects are noteworthy.  Using noted actors such as Ian McShane, Bob Hoskins, Toby Jones, Ray Winstone, Nick Frost, etc.  was controversial and offended many SGA card carrying dwarves, but the CGI transformations are brilliantly done and its hard to fault or criticize this casting decision.  Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman is requisite hero sturdiness, but nothing outstanding.<br />In essence, this is Charlize's movie and makes me wonder how a better Snow White would've made a much better film.  Recommended mainly to bask in Theron's scene-stealing queen."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I just watched this film and all i can say is WOW. Everyone in this country needs to see this film. I am a 50 year old woman and i watch the news and read the paper daily and never have I seen something that effects the lives of so<br />many. I am gong to buy a few copies and tell people to watch and then pass it on.<br />What is wrong with the FDA and all those in charge of our food, that they would allow this to go on. I for one will never eat another tyson or purdue chicken. I will make an effort today to find an organic grower in my area.<br />We have to start voting with our pocketbook, and we have to stand up and say I am not going to take this anymore. Watch this film, eye opening.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I laughed so hard that I cried and my stomach hurt too. Absolutely love this video.

The DVD included in this pack contains ONLY the  ENGLISH  LANGUAGE  AUDIO, although the packaging clearly indicates that it includes FRENCH and SPANISH audio.  In fact, it states that the French is Canadian French.

B001684L0A	5.0	b	I had the good fortune to view John Adams the HBO miniseries as it played on HBO.  As an elementary school teacher and a long time lover of the story of our nation's birth, I have seen and read a number of fictionalized accounts of our 2nd President.  My favorite has always been the musical 1776 but this treatment may very well have surpassed even that.  It is so rich and many-layered.  It shows the grit and the difficulty of life for our founding fathers and mothers. It portrays characters we often think of as larger-than-life heroes as real, flawed men.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is John Adams.  He is the idealistic, bullish young man who defends a group of British soldiers because it is the right thing to do.  He is the husband and lover of Abigail (played enchantingly by Laura Linney).  He is the father, the statesman, the revolutionary, the world traveller, the dissilusioned Vice President and the hopeful but ultimately somewhat ineffective President.  He portrays all the facets of John Adams so that I forgot I was watching Paul Giamatti and saw only John Adams.<br /><br />This is a carefully, lovingly crafted piece of filmmaking.  See it!
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	This is the worst Harry Potter movie ever made, Too much plots removed and it was confusing for everyone who did not read the book.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	my son already had a copy of this movie but over time it had worn down and had many scratches. We purchased the new copy which included a dvd and blu-ray copy as well. The movie was well packaged and as stated in seller's note; brand new never used. We were very impressed with time frame in which the movie arrived, I would highly recommend this seller to all.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	I have had this awhile what can I say they are all really great i love the extras the only movie i didn't really like was POA. that being said good movies.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Since it was a yucky evening outside, I decided to rent Snow White and the Huntsman from Amazon. I have to admit that I had serious reservations about devoting time to watch this movie. I am NOT a fan of Kristin Stewart. But, I figured that Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron would make up for what Kristin Stewart lacked in acting.<br /><br />I will start this review off by saying that I'm a huge fan of Chris Hemsworth. I enjoy watching the movies that he's in and I personally don't feel like his acting is bad. Throughout this movie, I feel like Chris Hemsworth gave some very good performances. He really put his all into the character and I feel like the movie could have really excelled with him as the protagonist. Plus, he's smoking hot. I think more screen time for him can only improve this movie.<br /><br />Review below/Some very slight spoilers<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />The scenery in this movie was gorgeous. There were lush forests that were green and verdant...teeming with fairy life and make believe creatures. There were other places that were dark and dangerous. I loved how the dark forest was actually dangerous! Instead of just a dead acre of trees. I could watch this movie again just for all the wonderful scenery.<br /><br />Next, I would give the world building a low grade. When it comes to the queen and the castle, I don't understand why no force was able to destroy it. The end of this movie was really lackluster and makes the viewer pretty confused with the easy victory. I feel like the village of woman was a fantastic concept and made perfect sense within this world. But, if your figure in this village and the fact that the queen was stealing the youth from all the young women in the surrounding villages...Snow White is the only pretty girl left in the entire Kingdom. She's basically the fairest of them all by default.<br /><br />Charlize Theron was such a fantastic actress. She really out shown all her costars in this film with the sheer brilliance of her talent. Her back story is briefly highlighted but, helped to add some additional depth to her character. I would have liked have understood a bit more about the relationship she and her brother had. Is he with her by choice? I couldn't really tell.<br /><br />Seriously, just watch this movie for Charlize and Chris Hemsworth. Speaking of Chris Hemsworth, I really wanted to give him a hug throughout this movie. Poor guy...<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />I really don't want to hate on Kristin Stewart a lot in my review. But, she doesn't have a large range of emotions when acting and I feel that this really takes away from crucial scenes. Another actress should have been chosen for this role.<br /><br />Wow, this movie had a LOT of plot holes. I usually don't even notice this stuff and it became really distracting for me.
B0090XJJT6	1.0	b	This seller sent me two defective products. The first DVD froze and would not play. I returned it and the seller provided me with another copy free of charge. The second copy was equally as defective as the first, freezing after 45 minutes. Very poor quality DVD and I would not make any other DVD purchases from this seller.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	We loved this movie in the theatre and can't wait for it to come out on DVD.  It's great and the animation is amazing.
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	I really did enjoy it. Guess we'll never know if anyone else could have played Snow White any better, but when you sleep with the director.......I guess you pretty much got the gig on lock either way.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Durham is certainly not politically correct but he is funny. I would recommend this to DVD to anyone who wants a good laugh.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	I highly recommend this extremely thought provoking film. It's beautifully done and Mr. Stein is always interesting to watch. I hope the controversy surrounding the movie will cause people to take a look at this film. A lot of hard work went into making it and it shows in every second on screen.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I wasn't really expecting what I saw with Fireproof. It's the story of a man and woman whose marriage has frosted over to the point where they no longer think they can stand it. The husband turns to his father for support, and receives a diary that withholds day by day entries of acts of love he should perform to save his marriage. Ultimately, these acts bring him closer to the concept of God and Christianity. He overcomes his addiction to pornography and learns to be a considerate, loving, and helpful husband. I felt like Fireproof was a more realistic look at what love and marriage are really about, and didn't skim over the brutalities and confusion that will be experienced. It cleared up questions for me about marriage and what it means to work for something deeper and long-lasting while, also, illustrating how relationships built on the foundation of God are strong.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	No criticism intended in my review title, they obviously HAD to condense this book for filmmaking purposes.  Even J.K. Rowling is now admitting the book itself could have used cutting; the filmmaker here does a very decent job of concentrating on the necessary and pruning the rest.<br /><br />It might have been nice if a few things weren't changed - magically inept Dolores Umbridge bursting through the door/wall of the Room of Requirement seemed a little over-the-top, for example.  And why try to tag Cho Chang with revealing critical information about Dumbledore's Army and their meeting-place?  Even if she's subsequently let off by another invented element, a veritaserum interrogation.  A few key elements, such as the role of Kreacher, the connections of the Blacks with other wizarding families, and the golden locket found at the Black residence on Grimmauld St. were also missing, which could cause them problems in the next film...although given that most of those viewing these films have read the books, that may not be too much of a problem.<br /><br />All in all this is quite a good film. It features at least two fine new characters - Imelda Staunton's Dolores Umbridge, perhaps even more evil for resembling a nice, cloth coat-clad Republican lady from the Midwest, and the amazingly on-target portrayal of Luna Lovegood by newcomer Evanna Lynch.  Their work only adds to the many rich characterizations of Rowling's characters provided by other actors in the previous films and continued in this one.<br /><br />The action concludes with a terrific final duel between Dumbledore and He Who Must Not be Named, which shows how effectively the films have used special effects as well.  The depictions of the Ministry, the Department of Mysteries and its dark veil of death are all exceptionally well-done.<br /><br />I'd have to recommend this film highly.  Rowling has been very effective at using her influence to make certain that her books are well-filmed, and this film is no exception.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Let me just say, this works JUST FINE on my PS3. Not a long load time, maybe a minute for the disc. Then after, VERY fast.<br /><br />Iron Man the movie, is a fun ride. I really liked re-watching it again on Blu Ray. It looks and sounds AMAZING.<br /><br />The 2nd disc is FULL of hours of making of features. This is how DVD special features should be made. I was very impressed and I buy all my DVD's in 2 disc just for special features and Iron Man doesn't disappoint.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	As with those that are writing about the 3d version only I would also strongly advise you to save your money.  The glasses that come with the movie are a complete waste of time and my Sony glasses don't work with the movie.  Amazon needs to remove all the reviews that are about the movie in general, and keep only the reviews of the 3D version, because the movie is good, however the 3D version IS NOT - DON'T BUY.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is one of the best miniseries I have seen in years.  The acting is superior and the settings true to history, thanks to Williamsburg.  This is a must see and have for your video collection.
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	After purchasing and returning my first attempt with this DVD, I found out that my new SONY Blu-Ray player does not have 3D capability and therefore cannot play this DVD. I returned the first disc (thinking it was damaged in some way) and will have to return the second. I contacted the service rep for SONY and was told that SONY had no upgrades or plans to upgrade my new player to 3D (eventhough it stated in the documents of the player that they were anticipating an upgrade to 3D). DO NOT BUY THIS DVD IF YOU DO NOT HAVE 3D CAPABILITY ON YOUR BLU-RAY PLAYER. I had forgotten that this film had 3D parts in it and didn't realize it until I had returned the first DVD for not playing on my machine. I'll have to purchase the regular widescreen version in order to play this film. That's too bad, and the necessity of 3D capability should be made part of the product description for this version of THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	As usual, my entire family enjoyed this Harry Potter film.  It is a bit darker than earlier films, but life does tend to get a bit darker as we grow older.  The most wonderful thing about this item for me is with the 2-disc edition, you get great interviews and other backstage info that brings the film to life in brilliant ways.  This is definitely a splendid addition to our Harry Potter films collection.
B00447G29S	1.0	b	DO NOT BUY THE 3D VERSION OF THIS FILM.<br />Yes, I like the movie, but the 3D version is awful!!  The 3D version should not be available for purchase.<br />It is the worst thing I have seen. The 3D imaging is blurry and there is very little of it.<br />Stick with the regular DVD version.<br />Please, please don't waste your money!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	When I was in high school in the 60's, my family took me on a trip across the United States. It left such an impression that I took my family on a similar trip a few years back. However, it was not as enjoyable and this movie helped me to understand why. We stayed on the freeways the second time around and did not get on the rural roads to see the real America.<br /><br />Cars is the best animated Disney movie I have every seen. It has great graphics, is funny (Larry the Cable as 'Mater is hilarious), tells a good story and reminds all of us that true American values are alive and well and meaningful living is still taking place in small towns all across America that have been bypassed long ago by the expressways.<br /><br />Cars sends a strong message to its viewers in this fast paced world we live in ... slow down and smell the roses. There is a Route 66 out there that has many wonderful things to show you. Take it.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	John Adams miniseries; history made interesting and entertaining.  What a concept.  Stellar performances all around though Paul Giamatti was so intense at times it was borderline insanity.  Probably just like the real Adams though.  I would recommend this to anyone with even a passing interest in American History.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	I'm not a fan of superhero movies, but this one was a nice exception.<br /><br />I was surprised at how the story drew me in and the action kept me focused.<br /><br />Ironman is a good movie.  'Nuff said.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	First, if you love the book series - you will be dissappointed. However, as a series I thought this was good, because I like the genre, but it took me a bit to get past how it fails the books it is based on.<br /><br />I had no problem with the series developing minor characters - they're interesting, one of Ms. Harris' talents. However, the series couldnt seem to stop themselves from layering certain characters to an almost ridiculous level. LaFayette is flamboyant and naughty, perfect as a regular in the series. However, producers kept the flamboyant, gay cook, but also made him a drug dealer and part-time prostitute. Same thing with ego-centric Jason Stackhouse. However, this character is personally disgusting. Instead of seeing how he can be repulsive in his attitude - he lives in squalor and general behavior leaves little to sympathize with.<br /><br />I think they could have done better.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	My mother and I took my two children, ages 3 and 5, to see the movie and we were both thrilled and surprised by their reactions.  My 3 year old, who normally can't sit still, barely moved or uttered a syllable during the entire movie.  They were truly enchanted by the story. For my mothere and I, watching my children watch the movie was so much fun that we had to go back a second time to see it ourselves. We took the kids, of course, and they enjoyed it just as much the second time.<br /><br />Polar Express is definitely a Christmas classic.  The animation is amazing...especially the steam coming from the radiator and train.  Despite what some critics say, I thought that they did an excellent job in the animation of the characters.  Yes, they are at times a little less than perfect, but it did not detract from the experience.<br /><br />The story was beautiful and held a beautiful lesson, but didn't hit you over the head with it as often happens in children's movies.  It was a real roller coaster ride and my children and I can't wait until November when it comes to video.<br /><br />As a side note, my children are still pretending the family van is the polar express when we go anywhere!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I had wanted to get this on Blu-Ray for a long time now, but only recently pulled the trigger on it.  I have to say that it lived up to all of the hype. It is a great picture quality and a great audio track.  For fans of the movie, I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"This review is short and sweet. What a wonderful movie for anyone of any age! It presents values without preaching, it has humor, and it aptly displays a nostalgia for days when driving the highways of America was an experience, not merely a means of getting from here to there as fast as one can. Thanks to this movie, I try to find stretches of road that evoke Americana when I travel. It doesn't hurt to venture more than a mile off the interstate. In fact, it's quite pleasant. And ""Cars"" reminds us of that."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I have no idea who IronMan is, I never read comics and do NOT have any extended reviews of this movie.  I can say however that I just saw it last night on my big screen downstairs and absolutely loved it.  The basic story line is a weapons developer, Stark, played by Robert Downey Jr is captured by enemies using his weapons to cause destruction and chaos through terrorism. During his captivity he invents a new type of energy that allows him to make some awesome new developments, in the process a villian is revealed that is initially considered his friend, this villian steals the invention from him and they fight.<br /><br />Overall it did not seem as long as it was, and was extremely entertaining.  Downey does an excellent job keeping us entertained and most importantly keeping my attention.  A great movie for your library if its something you are into keeping.
B001OHS8BQ	1.0	b	Horrible acting.  Horrible plot.  Kind of leaning towards religious propaganda.  Remember that most people that have bought this have an agenda to push.  I wish I didn't waste the money based on these reviews.
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"What an ungainly piece of celluloid this is. What a misanthropic, brutal, soulless wreck. What a relentlessly gruesome, amoral, soul-deadening slice of grindhouse pulp.<br /><br />And yet, what fun it is to look at, and how entertaining and involving it becomes.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is a perfect example of the kind of film where the talents at work totally overwhelm the subject matter, resulting in a work of art that is much better than it needs to be but is ultimately chained down by the nature of its content. Director Robert Rodriguez, guest director Quentin Tarantino, and a splendid cast of not simply big names but iconic ones squeeze every inch of mileage they can get out of what amount to three stories that really only exist to string along scenes of ever-mounting, sadistic violence that is so shocking that I can't believe it can pass for mainstream entertainment. Simply put, the R-rating for this film is a joke-- even Takashi Miike's ""Audition,"" Gasper Noe's ""Irreversible,"" Scorcese's ""Casino,"" and Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" don't match ""Sin City"" for sheer brutality. Forget about ""Kill Bill""; it's not even in the same category.<br /><br />And yet, somehow, the sheer momentum and energy carries the viewer through. Every image oozes style and cool, and the atmosphere is so thoroughly badass that you end up getting swept away despite yourself. Never mind that (SPOILER) the only characters with any moral fiber whatsoever end up dead (END SPOILER). Never mind that the women are either sluts or hookers and the men are murderers and villains. Never mind that there's not an ounce of value that emerges from ""Sin City""'s barrage of ugly cynicism. If you watch this film, you will be unable to take your eyes from it. That's some achievement, given what actually happens on screen. Heck, this movie even survives relentlessly bad performances by its two key female leads; the beautiful, talented Rosario Dawson dons a sexy outfit, but hams it up a little too much; and the significantly less beautiful, less talented actress whom I know only as ""that irritating bitch from the ""Gilmore Girls"" and who singlehandedly undermines the movie's credibility whenever she steps on screen.<br /><br />Also, I've got to admit that I've got a certain amount of love for any action movie that earns its R rating in this era of neutered, PG-13 rated flicks where the trailers are more sexy and violent than the actual films. I'll take ""Sin City"" and ""Bad Boys II,"" flawed though they may be, over ""The Bourne Supremecy"" any day of the week.<br /><br />Still, in spite of what's been accomplished here as far as pure filmmaking goes, you can't help but wonder what the people involved in this project could have done with a more imaginative, if equally pulpy, set of stories."
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	I truely enjoy the book series but sadly was enraged by the poor attempt to turn it to a tv series. From the cheese bad acting to the loose story lines its all bad. If you like day time soaps or dramas like Melrose then you would like this. If you enjoy sexy vampires, werewolves or even the Sookie attitude then definatly skip this butchering of a great story.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"For those who have seen and love Indiana Jones' adventures, ""...The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" follows the formulary of the previous exciting and wonderful films.  They had enough campy lines in them to make them memorable in every way. This is a must see because it is part of the Indiana Jones series.  But it portends a bigger and better sequal for us jaded action film goers where story development is as important as action.  Four stars."
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"I've never seen an M. Night movie before, though by now everyone is aware of his reputation. And upon first viewing I was ready to throw my lot in with the naysayers. The dialogue was wooden. The ""twists"" were predictable (I called all except one, and I am not very astute). And that ending... when the second half of the movie totally negates the first half, it makes you feel like an idiot for caring. Not to mention everything else that's wrong (wouldn't it take generation upon generation to create a self-sustaining village with no knowledge of the outside world?). But upon second viewing (with my family) I was ready to just sit back and enjoy the good things. And there are good things. The actors really stepped it up (especially Howard and Hurt, really dig Hurt's speech at the end), and the cinematography is appropriately creepy and claustrophobic, promising something it can never quite deliver. Does that excuse the predictability and annoying literary shortcuts Shyamalan takes? Dunno, you'll have to see how far your suspension of disbelief will take you. Three stars seems about right."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"I first saw <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WGWQG8"">John Adams (HBO Miniseries)</a> on HBO when it aired in weekly installments. Now on DVD, I have seen the series twice and could easily watch it again. A perfect marriage of education and entertainment, this series captures the spirit and (quite possibly) terror the founding fathers faced in building our nation. Reading dry textbooks about that period, it's easy to forget how unbelievably volatile that period was. That, prior to now, John Adams was lost to the annals of history is a shame, but this 7-hour film is a testament to his beliefs and what he sacrificed to begin a nation anew. If this series doesn't restore your faith in this nation and make you want to learn all you can about civics, I don't know what will. I'm making my way through the book, which--while riveting--is long, and whenever I feel a little bogged down I go back to the DVD and refresh the well."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I started the program on Sept 20th and while I have not lost the weight I though I would, I've lost more inches then I could have imagined. Four inches in less than a month. If you are looking for a workout that will push your limits and leave you gasping for breath, but cause you to feel stronger, more alive, and more active, this is the one. Not good for you if you have never worked out, but if it's been a few years and you need a sharp kick in the rear, Shawn T will give it to you.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Bonus content, director's commentary....deleted scenes anyone? Almost makes me feel bad for the disc. A 2-disc special edition would just be cruel.....shudder....!
B008UZ7MUI	2.0	b	"After all the defending I have done in the past of the HP movies, I think I deserve better.  The books are highly evolved AND involved, way too much content to try and cram into a cluster of a movie.  I thought movies 1-6 were incredibly done and I fought tooth and nail with ""real"" fans who thought they were so cool because they had read the books before the movies even came out and would bash everyone who liked the movies because the ""movies left too much out"".  But this movie, I will NOT defend in the same way.<br /><br />Why?  Because it is garbage made with one purpose and that is this: $$$.  Lets see how we can keep our costs low and our earning high.  I thought the purpose of splitting this story into 2 movies was so that it could be exceptionally detailed and leave it all on the floor for the finale.  This is the closer for freaking Harry Potter, both movies could have been 3-4 hours long and people would have never even blinked the whole time!  Don't say you couldn't do more because you didn't have the right time frame.<br /><br />The entire story is rushed.  Key events are left out (Krum and Harry's talk at the wedding, Kreature's major role, the insight to the Deathly Hallows) or changed, such as the scene with Wormtail.  That was an incredible part in the book, why did we just simply knock him out?!  It seems like the characters are uncomfortable with their lines and just trying to blurt them out as quickly as possible.  My heart was racing for the chase scene in the beginning but that was the most boring pile of crap I've ever seen!  When I read the Deathly Hallows and Hagrid fell from his broom, I was sure he was dead.  Everything pointed that direction, and when he was found to be alive, it was like the 2nd coming to me. But in this movie?  Oh no, lets cut that out so we can put Bill in here saying ""Hi, my name's Bill, I was attacked by a werewolf"", no better way of getting some back story than that huh?<br /><br />I bet Rowling is pissed.  Sources tell me she has a history of being unhappy with the movies, especially for downplaying the elves and after what they did to Kreature I'm sure she'd like to come down with the hammer of the gods.  Please I beg you before watching this, if you have not read the books READ THEM so people like me aren't having to sit there with a whole group of people and explain every freaking detail because the POS movie left out most every important fact that you need to know!<br /><br />Someone answer me this question, who was the cool looking snatcher guy with the long hair?  See, I read the book and I don't even know who that is!  Can someone please PLEASE reboot this movie?  Hell we are redoing Spider-Man, why not give a little more forethought into a work of literature that has pretty much been a major history mark for a generation?<br /><br />Did this movie really not deserve a little more thought and time?  Did we really have to rush it?  I will say that yes, there is a lot of downtime in the book that wouldn't have been interesting enough for movie scenes but come on!!! Part 2 better be the best movie ever made or then I will know for a FACT these movies were made with the all mighty dollar sign in eyes and I will forever lose faith in novel adaptations.<br /><br />This movie is OK for people who haven't read the books but I think even Potter fans that have never read a book in their life will notice this just isn't up to par.  I'm buying it simply to finish out my collection.  I give this movie 2 fingers WAY WAY up."

B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	If you know Jeff Dunham, this is for you! All the charachters that Jeff is known for make a showing. Walter, cheerful as ever...Jose Jalapeno (on a stick), and a personal favorite, Peanut. Hilarious, laugh out loud, and worth watching over an over!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	we really enjoyed it.  interesting characters.  Writing was good.  looking forward to next season
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Fans of who have following this adventure will not be disappointed.  The movie is true to the story line of the book, but it is definitely a darker movie.
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	The photography in this movie is amazing and very true to comic books.  However, not having read these comics, the plot didn't make sense.  My husband had the same reaction.  I could appreciate the gratuitous nudity, but the continuous violence was a turn off.  Overall, I wish I'd stuck with just watching the trailer.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	Cute movie. Tom Hanks should be in more animated movies. My niece loves it. :)
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"This is easily the most stylish film to come out since ""The Matrix.""  The look of the movie uses the same experimental technique I first saw in a Francis Ford Coppola film called ""Rumble Fish"" where the entire movie is shot in black and white with certain parts of each scene colorized for stark contrast.  This idea was later polished and brought to the mainstream in the film ""Pleasantville.""  Since this film is based on a Noirish comic book the mixture of extreme black and white lighting with the colorful highlights makes for a fine visual experience.  As for the cast, most of the actors turn in good performances; the most notable being those of Mickey Rourke and a remarkable cameleon-like transformation from Benicio Del Toro.  The female characters are primarily two-dimensional buxom babes with little depth of emotion, but this film is based on a comic book for young men, after all.  There are a couple of forgettable performances given by Clive Owen and Michael Madsen.  Clive Owen's work here is wooden, and Michael Madsen is plain petrified and uninspired.  I kept having the feeling that Michael Madsen joined the project in the hopes of snaring Mickey Rourke's role, and when he didn't get it, severe apathy set in.  He was great in ""Resevoir Dogs,"" but this is by far and away the worst performance in any of his films that I've seen.  The storyline is another ""Pulp Fiction""-like yarn with disjointed narrative that jumps back and forth between three violent and seemingly separate stories that cross paths at the end of the film.  The almost constant voice-over narration can be a burden on the generic movie-goer who wants more traditional film-fare, but it fits the style of this film perfectly.  There are some tedious moments, especially since this movie clocks in at over two hours, but the final result is an exciting experience with plenty to rave about and praise.  This film is destined for the Cult Classic section at your local video store."
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	"I kept hearing about the movie ""Cars,"" but somehow I never got around to seeing it. Then lately, I stumbled upon the DVD and purchased it on the advice of my companion. We watched it a couple evenings later. It's an amusing and somewhat touching movie. Dumb, perhaps, but amusing.<br /><br />The story involves Lightning McQueen, an ambitious rookie racecar who unexpectedly finds himself marooned in the old Route 66 Arizona town of Radiator Springs. McQueen was on route to the big Piston Cup Championship in California where he was to compete against two pros with whom he'd tied in a previous race.<br /><br />In Radiator Springs, McQueen gets in trouble with the law and has to do community service repairing the street. As such, he gets to know Some of the town's characters. Sally, a 2002 Porsche, becomes his lady friend. Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet, gradually reveals he was a previous three-time Piston Cup winner. Mater, a beat up but trusty tow truck, helps him realize that there are other things just as important as racing. McQueen eventually goes on to compete in the Piston Cup, where he could have won.<br /><br />It's an amusing story, well told. There are chuckles here and there. The depictions of the cars and the setting of Radiator Springs are interesting. In places, the movie is touching. It'll probably pick up a few awards, but I wouldn't rank it with the best animations.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I am a fan of Marvel and DC comics.  I never thought Robert Downey, Jr. as a superhero, but he sure did play a good Iron Man.  This comic book movie is one of the best superhero movies of the year, the best is The Dark Knight, but still I give it my highest rating.  For the sequel please put Mandarin in.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	To begin with, settling down to watch this film, I began to think there had been a mistake. Did they really have to put fifteen minutes of ads for various stupid video games first?  There's even a Lego Harry Potter game!  I was wondering how much it woukld cost to return the thing from Australia before I finally found 'Chapter 7' which seemed to be the actual film.<br />Next time, manufacturer, just give me the film.<br />The film was OK, but only OK.  I'll still buy the finale of course. For a long-time Harry Potter fan, it's obligatory.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I found this to be a outstanding interpretation of the book with excellent performances and outstanding production quality.  Why networks don't produce quality shows like this instead of the reality crap (read: inexpensive to produce) that dominates the public airways is beyond common sense.  I went through the entire 3-DVD set in 5-nights, and thoroughly enjoyed each episode in the miniseries.  If more people support high quality historical shows (read: expensive to produce) like this, perhaps the network exec's will come to their senses and get the message that reality is out, and real history is in.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Absolutely a joy to watch.  I was entertained the entire time. acting and cinematography were superb. Brings teh old take to life in a new way and leaves you feeling like you have relived the adventure all over again.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	My review will be somewhat vague because, frankly, I liked it and don't want to give away any spoilers.<br /><br />The setting is a 19th century village.  A village protected from the outside world, the world of evil towns, by the woods.  But something in the woods also keeps the people inside the village.  Monsters, Those Who Should Not be Named, whatever you call them, they stay in the woods and the people stay in the village.<br /><br />But what happens when the Monsters start to enter the village?  Did somebody go into the woods?  Did somebody anger the Monsters?<br /><br />At first this movie seems like a horror flick.  Then it becomes a thriller, a mystery to be solved.  Then in the clearing with red flowers, as one of the girls in the theater I watched it in screamed, it becomes a horror flick again.  By the end it has totally, completely changed in setting, theme, everything.  The end brings this flash of insight to what the whole film was about and you understand that the Monsters were never in the woods.<br /><br />The Monsters were in the Village.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This is one of the best films I have seen.  Incredibly eye opening.  What the USDA is doing is falling asleep at the wheel. And people are getting sick and for one young child featured, died from ecoli from eating a hamburger.  Heartbreaking.  We need to eat more organic and clue in to what is really going on in or food systems and whats really going on.  Trust me, this will open your eyes.  Unsettling, yes, a bit, but necessary.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I would purchase again from the same seller and yes the film was well received.<br /><br />Thank You-
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	I bought the blu-ray version for my blu-ray player but when the menu comes up and I click on an episode (any episode, any disc) the HBO static comes up and it shuts off the blu-ray player.  The disc then re-starts.  I can't get past the menu!
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"Ignore the negative reviews from fans who expect every word of the story to be adapted into a twenty-hour long movie.  This film condenses the essentials of the storyarc into one of the most powerful cinematic experiences I've had.<br /><br />From the opening sequence, I knew that this would be the best movie of the series. And it is. By far. From the outstandingly ballsy cinematography to the acting (it's like night and day between this movie and ""Goblet of Fire"", which was great in it's own right but can't touch this), from the witty and quirky script to the special effects, it's clear that director David Yates single handedly whipped the Harry Potter movie franchise into shape. While movies 1-4 were great, they were like unpolished stones; at points they tried so hard to go along with the books and at others tried so hard to separate themselves from the books (think ""Prisoner of Azkaban""'s shrunken heads), but this movie--""Order of the Phoenix""--knows what it is. It is a film, and it makes sense as a film. Everything you need to know to understand the film is here, and--unlike ""Goblet of Fire""--you won't need a previous understanding of the books or even the other movies. Certainly fans will complain about deviance from the book, but these are the same unreasonable people that wish the movies would be twenty-four hours long so they could squeeze in every line of dialogue. ""Order of the Phoenix"" is how a book should be adapted.<br /><br />Every actor, from Daniel Radcliffe to Emma Watson to the kid who plays Dudley, is at the tippy top of their game. They're playing young adults and they act it; they laugh, and they cry. This is the first time that I actually totally suspended my disbelief while watching a Potter film, and that was almost all due to the superb acting.<br /><br />I did expect a bit more from the climax (the important character death was kind of wiggy) but things get roaring back into shape for a perfect duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. Following that, everything touched on in the movie wraps up beautifully. No threads are left untied, and no plot left with an open end. Very, very satisfying. Oh, and if that isn't enough, this should be: Evanna Lynch is spine-tinglingly good as Luna Lovegood.<br /><br />It may not be what you expected, it may not be what you thought you wanted... But for me, it was more on both counts.<br /><br />10/10 Classic."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	If one were to open their mind to other possibilities and realize that Darwinism is a THEORY, not a fact, this documentary may provide valuable insights into what is wrong with science today. First of all, science should explore ALL possibilities and keep those possibilities open to debate and study until PROVEN wrong (much like science is doing with Darwinism). Ben Stein isn't debating whether or not there is ID, he is asking the science community why they are closed to anything other then Darwin (again, just a THEORY). I highly recommend this documentary for a little insight into the closed-minded science of Darwinism. Real science explores and keeps exploring all theories, anything else is self-promoting agenda.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"DONT WORRY, I wont spoil the ending.<br /><br />Just had to leave my opinion. I was suprised to read so many bad reviews when I first heard of ""The Village"". So naturally, I just had to see it. It was like Blade, that had really bad reviews, and when I saw it, I loved it. Of course that was a few years back.<br /><br />Anyway, the review.<br /><br />I really liked it. I am also one of those who did not enjoy the Sixth boring sense. However I did enjoy Unbreakable. Its hard to compare this movie to any other without actually ruin the ending. It doesnt take a genius to figure out that there is going to be a big twisted ending. Never the less, that was the good part of the movie, because I was really trying to figure out for myself what it would be, and in the end, in the very end I was like: OH WOW!! GOOD ONE!!<br /><br />I think that the reason why a lot of people dont like it, is because the story isnt really that interesting, it is just a kind of a build-up for the surprises. The new actress whats her name, was cool. I really look forward to enjoy more flicks with her. She has got a sertain look.<br /><br />The only thing i really didnt like, was that even thou she was convincing in her role, I really didnt think she was blind. You kinda get very early that she is blind, but as blind as she was, she had a lot of ""seing moments"" it welt like.<br /><br />Anyway, words really cant explain ""The Village"". Dont believe the hype, and enjoy a movie with an interesting twist. At least try to figure out the twist if you think its boring otherwise. I think its a hell of a challange to figure out the ending.<br /><br />ps. the Pianist guy, Brody or whats his name, is really funny and scary in this movie."
B0032CNOK6	2.0	b	I thought this was a disappointing presentation and was not really worth the hype it was originally given when it was released. I was left with the feeling that although this topic is deserving of a good debate with people who were willing to provide their deep knowledge as to why they feel and think how they do, they do not do that on this DVD - in my opinion the general level of debate was superficial!<br /><br />I cannot help but comment that National Geographic and Nova productions cover this sort of subject in greater detail and with greater understanding being given to their viewers.<br /><br />But then again, Ben Stein is a comedian and I guess his sense of humor shines through this DVD.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	The movies are getting weaker and weaker since the 3rd movie. Maybe my expetations are too high since I have read all the books. And they have definitly gotten worse with the new Dumbledore!
B001684L0A	4.0	b	I really don't find useful the reviews complaining about how much better the book was and how chopped, different, worse, incomplete (insert the adjective of your preference here) this miniseries is. I didn't read the book. I'm not gonna read the book, which must be fantastic I'm sure, but I simply lack the disposition to read it. I have thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Try to understand this is a different media and it would be impossible or impractical to include every single fact, anecdote and detail in the book. This is an adaptation and it should be judged as such. And that goes for all the books/novels taken to the big/TV screen as well. So what if Adams wasn't portrayed exactly like he was in real life? How can anyone know how he acted for sure? If the way he's portrayed differs from the book or other sources it shouldn't necessarily be viewed as something negative. It's a director's/Screenwriter's vision on the matter. Why not be open to an alternate version of what you knew? It's not an absolute truth, is a version of a passage in history.<br /><br />As for the product itself is a miniseries of great quality in its script, performances, art direction. Laura Linney is fantastic in this. One of her very best performances. It looks incredible in Blu-ray. Good purchase!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"An excellent film that kept us interested all the way through, except I feel too much time was spent on the woman who lost a child and we fast forwarded through some of that.  I am sorry for her loss but it just dragged on too long.  My skeptical husband since bought the DVD and has been passing it around to friends, who now want me to raise all their chicken and pork for them :-D<br /><br />Unlike PETA films this one does not try to gross you out and make you a vegetarian.  There are a few short graphic scenes but rather than try to sicken you, the message they are trying to get across is how a handful of Big Ag companies control over 80% of America's food supply, and how politically powerful and nearly untouchable these companies are.  It all seems very bleak, but at the end you are told how you can get better control of your own food supply... for example raise whatever you can, buy direct from the farmer at the farm or at farmers' markets, at the very least eat simpler and make as much as possible from scratch and fresh foods rather than buying prepackaged, highly processed foods.<br /><br />One point I would like to make about the chickens is that they are not ""forced"" to grow unnaturally fast as some reviewers say... they have been BRED to grow that way.  I grow the same chickens, Cornish Cross broilers, in my ""back yard"" (we have 10 acres).  Mine spend the first three weeks in the brooder til they are feathered out, and in addition to meat bird starter get hand pulled clover and grass with dirt and roots, as well as all the fine hay bits leftover from feeding other animals.  After moving to pasture pens I cut their high-powered Meat Grower feed with 25% plain scratch because in my first batch, before I cut the feed, I did have a few keel over from congestive heart failure from too-rapid growth.  They also get moved to fresh grass 2-3x daily.  No problems with the next two batches -- I ordered 75 chicks and was shipped 79 (a good hatchery always includes a few extras) in those batches and had only 3 die, and those within the first few days, weak ones/shipping stress.  I butchered from 6 to 8 weeks of age and while I did not weigh them, visually they were almost all larger than the storebought birds which are usually 3-1/2 to 4 lbs.  In fact some were Godzilla chickens, about 8-10 lbs!<br /><br />I love meat and will never be vegetarian unless I am forced to it.  Some people will take this movie as a call to vegetarianism.  I see it as a reason to buy your food direct from the farmer who grows it, one who allows you to visit the farm personally and see how it is raised.  ""Organic"" simply means the animal was fed organically-grown feed.  The animals can still be raised in terrible conditions and their meat labelled ""Organic"".  ""Cage Free"" and ""Free Range"" does not mean the birds are happily running around a pasture... it can mean there are still hundreds or thousands crowded at a square foot per bird into buildings, with all their food,water and shade inside so even if there is one small door to the ""free range"" outside they are likely not going to use it.<br /><br />I want to know how my meat was raised and how it died and was processed.  I am lucky in that I can raise and home butcher my own pork and chicken and buy my beef from a friend who raises her animals the same way I do.  Many cities are allowing folks within the city limits to keep chickens, so anyone can now keep their own for eggs or meat.  My own town has no regs against livestock at all and I know a man in the middle of town who raised a pig in his back yard last year.  He does have a large lot and kept the pen scrupulously clean so the neighbors would not have any complaints about smell.  Laying hens and meat birds make a lot less noise than your average dog.  Just don't keep any roosters to avoid annoying the neighbors (with meat birds sex doesn't matter, they are butchered long before they begin crowing)."
B0032CNOK6	3.0	b	"A good point in the film is when it showed a strong academic opposition to Intelligent Design supporters in the education system and how they were fired for opposing or questioning evolution.  But I was disappointed with the Expelled film when they interviewed Michael Shermer who wrote a book ""How to debate a creationist"" and during a film interview with Mr. Shermer there was no mention about a creationist speaker named Kent Hovind.  Mr. Shermer knew about Kent Hovind and his facts against evolution lies in textbooks but failed to mention in the interview.  Google ""Kent Hovind debates Michael Shermer"" and you can view a video taken at a university so there's no high funding film dollars to influence the truth or fancy editing to distort the truth.  In the debate I feel Michael Shermer did poorly and Kent Hovind was well organized with lots of facts and sources to exposing the evolution lies still pushed in the textbooks."
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00118T63C"">No Country for Old Men</a><br />Excellent movie.  From start to finish, this movie is acting genius and the plot keeps your attention the entire time. If you are not one for violence, I would not recommend it, but for those that like dramatic, intense movies, this flick will not disappoint.  Highly recommended!!!!!!  If you are a fan of Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, or Javier Bardem, you will be very pleased with the great performances, as well as an excellent supporting cast, including the Trailer Park Super.  She was even fantastic."
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	Good action superhero movie, very slick and very hollywood. Decent overall but no particular stand-out points here.
B00447G29S	3.0	b	I love this movie and was kind of disappointed with the 3D glasses.  They made it much more difficult to see the movie because they kept moving around on my face.  The 3D wasn't that great, either.  I'm still glad I bought it, though, and will continue to watch it.  Maybe you should offer really good 3D glasses as a separate purchase advertised as the ultimate way to enjoy your 3D purchase.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"I went into this film with no expectations at all, a free and clear mind.  And I can truly say, ""Thank you Ridley Scott.""<br />Having read quite a few reviews here, Iv'e noticed many lackluster or negative reviews. Well, to each his own. Its been some years that Iv'e gone to a film that has truly blown my mind. Most of Science Fiction today is so poor and embarrasing, that it hurts to watch. This is the return of true Sci-Fi genius and done by a master of the genre.<br />Some people are saying, ""They didn't explain that"", or ""I don't get it"", or ""that doesn't make sense."" Well, not all films explain everything, and to me, that's a good thing. I was glued to my seat the whole time and my palms were so sweaty, I dropped my pop.<br />I'm not going to go into a massive rant about the effects, or the plot or the macabre sets. There's plenty of those reviews here.<br /><br />(Thumbs up to Michael Fassbender who's performance as the android David was extrordinary.)<br /><br />So my point is basically do what other reviews have said, ""don't expect Oscars"" and go into this with a clear head and forget about ""Alien"". Even though you'll want to watch ""Alien"" as soon as you get home from the theatre.<br />I want to give this 5 stars but I have to go with my gut and give it 4 and a half stars. Still a remarkable accomplishment.<br /><br />This is truly unbelievable filmaking and this is what Sci-Fi is all about. Take it for what it is, a spetacular ride from start to finish.<br /><br />And thanks again Ridley for a truly remarkable film. Cannot wait for ""Blade Runner 2."" And of course, ""Prometheus 2."""
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	One of the best comedians we've seen in a while. Had to watch it a second time just to catch it all. Walter & Peanut really top it off. You have to give Jeff credit, he is the best!!!!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Here is a movie that will be a classic.  The animation is fantastic.  Tom Hanks makes a believer out of everyone.  A wonderful movie for the whole family.  This is a must for any Christmas collection.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Don't have HBO and relatives wanted us to see this series. So good I read the biography.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Pixar is always so creative!! I'd recommend this to anybody who wants to have a good night with their family, somebody who wants to give their kids something to watch, or just somebody who wants to be entertained in general!!
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	I'v seen his video clips on youtube and had to get the DVD. The clean version of this DVD is really not needed. He's funny and generally not vulgar. I hear worse language walking through Walmart. I'd recomend this DVD to anyone.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	I want my $12.50 back from when i saw it in the theatre.  There's no way I'm giving them any more money for this garbage.
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	I've seen better, I've seen worse.  I skipped all of the Twilight stuff, so this was the first time I'd seen Kristen Stewart act.  Like so many others have said, serious lack of talent there.  Dead eyes, she looked stoned through the entire movie.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was good or great.  The movie had a lot of potential, and it might have been great with a different actress playing Snow White.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Absolutely hysterical!! I bought this present for my daughter before she went away to school and it was a lot of fun to watch!  I would reccomend this video to anyone who wants a good laugh.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Iron Man is witty, well-paced, superbly crafted, finely acted and packed with satisfying action sequences.<br /><br />I must admit, I was only dimly aware of the existence of Iron Man before this movie was released. Now I think he's the coolest super-hero ever, which is a testament to just how great this movie is.<br /><br />The supporting cast is solid, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Robert Downey Jr. His Tony Stark is simply perfect -  he's an affable, arrogant womanizer, confident to a fault. As heir to a fortune made from arms sales he has no difficulties performing the mental acrobatics necessary to rationalize his role in facilitating fatalities. Downey is simply fun to watch - he makes the so called 'slow' segments, where he is maturing into his superhero role while building the suit, snappy and exiting.<br /><br />The single disc edition include some extended scenes but you'll have to put down a few dollars more to get the full set of extras on the 2 disc ultimate edition. Either way, you might as well take your socks off before you press 'play'. Highly Recommended!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen!  The best thing about it is it's clean and the whole family can watch! My son practically knows all of the routines by heart.  Definitely worth buying!
B008UBYTRG	3.0	b	"Juff Dunham is a funny guy - and Walter always causes spasms of laughter, but this isn't nearly as good as his first special, ""Arguing with Myself"". If you like Dunham, by all means watch it, but you can probably skip the ""Marvin the Superhero"" character, and possibly Achmed."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"My kids were very excited to get the ""new"" HP Blu-ray disc. We've all watched it several times already. It will be great to ""review"" before seeing Part 2 when it is released."
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Although I was expecting a little more focus on the humor part, the dry humor helped break up a very serious issue - how deep the divide is getting to be between the historical and scientifically supportive understanding that there was a creation, designed by a Creator.  Excellent research and personal respectful interviews.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	This movie has enforced what I already knew and yet opened my eyes wider too.  We should buy organic foods because as they are scanned at the supermarket we are indeed voting for healthy food.  Read the labels of what you buy and if you can't pronounce the ingredient, don't buy it.<br /><br />The horrors of the way animals are treated caused me to cry. Yet, some farmers encourage their cattle to graze on grass and are producing healthier meat.<br />This is a life changing movie that you should watch.<br /><br />Let the young ones watch too (they're used to violence in the movies) and they will open their eyes to how to live in the future.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"We loved this DVD. We saw him on Comedy Central, and loved the additional material on this disk. He's wonderfully funny and the different characters keep the comedy fresh. People with kids will appreciate that the disk comes with ""bleeped"" and ""unbleeped"" versions of the soundtrack (although neither the language or the content is extreme at all)."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"When I saw this movie in the theaters I enjoyed watching it enough, but I kept thinking this was the worst Pixar film I have seen. Funny thing is the worst Pixar film is still A grade material compared to most other animated features released. And while Cars didn't wow me on the big screen the way The Incredibles or Monsters Inc (or a score of other Pixar films) the film grew on me in a big way when we got it home. You see my son (two years old at the time) loved to watch it. Being the inclusive dad that I am I would watch it with him. I got what Pixar was doing when I first saw Cars, but it didn't resonate with me until repeated viewings. Now, while it's still not my favorite Pixar movie, Cars made a believer out of me in what they were saying about this film.<br /><br />You see Cars isn't just a cartoon about a world where cars are people. It's a tribute of the history of the automobile, a nod to NASCAR and its roots, and a love letter to Route 66. All of this done in a family-friendly and colorful animated universe. Any car nut with a broad spectrum interest in the automobile will find lots of different cars from different eras getting face time on this movie. NASCAR fans will love the racing sequences and level of detail dedicated to the sport. Those who remember the days before the Interstate system where there was as much fun travelling to your destination as there was being there will feel nostalgic for that time again. The movie hits on multiple levels, which is what makes it better than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Take that all away and you still have a fun cartoon. You have cars talking and acting like people for God's sake! The kids will eat that up! Cars are getting into crazy situations that are in their own way a slight play on human issues. There are plenty of little jokes on that vein that both the kids and parents can laugh over. There is even a joke or two with a double meaning the adults may get a kick out of. This is all classic Pixar and does much to fill in the little spaces between story development.<br /><br />The story? Well like I said when I first saw it I got what they were saying, but wasn't impressed. It's essentially much like an episode of The Andy Griffith Show I remember seeing where somebody from the big city gets stuck in Mayberry, desparate to get out, only to end up loving the town and wanting more. Maybe it was because it was in a way the preachiest of the Pixar films telling us we should slow down our busy lives and go back to simpler times. Not that it's a bad message. Just not one that held onto on first viewing. Well after watching it several more times with my excited toddler the little details come into play that I either missed or ignored the first time around. The sleepy town that slowly comes to life the more their new visitor gives to it. The beautiful backdrops of painted deserts and canyons. There is character growth going on.<br /><br />Cartoons live and die by their voice actors. While just about every animation company puts out movies that take advantage of celebrity power to gain an audience Pixar is one of the few who has consistently been able to get the best performances from them, and cars is no different. Every celebrity voice is pitch perfect and puts you in the view of the character more than the actor. Larry the Cable Guy as Mater the tow truck easily steals the show, but does it in such a way where you absolutely know it's Larry doing the voice, but you see Mater as a character in of itself rather than a cartoon Larry. Owen Wilson puts his best sly, but whiner-like demeanor for racing star McQueen that's his best. Some characters I still have trouble recognizing the transformation is so good. Tony Shalhoub (better known as Monk from the TV series) is absolutely unbelievable as tire shop owner Luigi. Better yet Michael Keaton as Chic Hicks barely sounds like Michael. Michael makes what is essentially the villain in the movie a very enjoyable and charismatic cut up. I can go on, but suffice it to say the ""acting"" is top notch.<br /><br />Animation wise all I have to say is this is Pixar. They are just about the best in the business and what you see in this movie will impress even today. The race scenes are dynamically shot the same way you would see a big NASCAR race with gravel, debris, smoke and skid marks looking real. The level of detail is very impressive from the waxed shine on the cars to the minute dust.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray release is pretty much identical to the previous release, but this time they include the DVD version as well. The differences between the Blu-Ray and DVD versions visually are striking, and that's admitting the DVD looks great. The Blu-Ray technically has two menus, but that's not a big deal. One of the menus has three options which are the movie, bonus cartoons and featurettes. Here's a breakdown (features on the DVD will have an * beside them):<br /><br />Mater and the Ghost Light*: Like all Pixar releases Cars comes with both the animated short that was viewed before the movie in theaters plus a totally new short related to the movie itself. This is a story about Mater scaring the town with little tricks so he is told a story about the infamous Ghost Light, which he then appears to experience after left alone. Goofy funny with Mater kind of replaying a number of scenes from the movie in a different way.<br /><br />One Man Band*: This is the short that was played before the movie in theaters. It's about two street musicians ""dueling"" for a little girl's coin. The musicians get more outrageous in their zeal for the money and things end up going crazy.<br /><br />Mater in Bounding: Remember the Pixar short with the Jackalope and sheep? Well this is a quickie (non hi-def) short of Mater replacing the sheep bouncing all over the place. I think it's something the animators put together for fun and are sharing with us.<br /><br />End Credits: Here you can see the animation end credits in full frame without the credits. Love the previous Pixar movie references.<br /><br />Production Features include:<br /><br />Two Full Length Commentaries: One is by Lasseter and the other with the production team (with pictures).<br /><br />Inspiration for 'Cars'*: Documentary told by John Lasseter on the inspiration for Cars including a jaunt through Route 66 and seeing some race cars in action.<br /><br />Documentary Shorts: There are seven little items here. ""Radiator Springs,"" ""Character Design,"" ""Animation and Acting,"" ""Real World Racing: Getting Geeky with the Details,"" ""Hudson Hornet,"" ""Graphics"" and ""Darrell Waltrip Museum Tour"". This is the real meat of the extras. You get to see the real love for the source material and how much they put into making the movie as much a car-lovers movie as possible.<br /><br />Cine-Explore: This is a way to see behind the scenes stuff while watching the movie. You can set it automatic or manually punch in the content. Much of the content comes from the other featurettes.<br /><br />Deleted Scenes*: These are just sketches and storyboards that never went beyond pre-production. It's interesting to see how the script evolved, but don't expect extra cartoons.<br /><br />Carfinder Game: It's dubbed as a very sophisticated BD game, but I call it incredibly tedious. The has three play modes. The primary mode is where you have to select a car from the bottom of your screen when it shows up in the movie. Next is the same concept, but this time the screen is frozen for an amount of time due to a massive amount of cars to rummage through. Third is like a bonus round where you get three images of the same car and you have to pick which one is accurate (with the other two having often the slightest differences in them).<br /><br />The reward for going through the game (which you cannot get out of until you finish the movie with it) is a Showroom that has all the cars you found. You can click on the showroom and get a pretty neat profile of that car and it's personal history. I have to admit I really like getting this information as it broadens the story greatly. It's just a bear of a game to go through. This isn't a casual game to kill a little time. Be prepared to commit.<br /><br />Cars is one of those movies that is very different from anything else out there, but then again you can say that for a good number of Pixar movies. It's a great movie for the car lover and those who enjoy remembering the 1950's driving experience where drive-ins and cruising mainstreet were how you treat a Friday night. Oh yeah... car racing fans will definitely get a kick out this film. If you aren't into any of that then you still should give this movie a try. It's VERY accessible to just everybody out there."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I really liked this movie in theaters and wanted to get it on DVD, but now I could get it in blue ray which is even better! The quality is great and I thought the cover was very neat. It's a good movie to get for your home entertainment. :]
B007FQDPL8	3.0	b	I've watched 4 episodes so far - this series is a great modern spin on the vampire myth.<br /><br />But the picture quality on the blu-ray leaves much to be desired.  It seems like every 3rd or 4th shot is really grainy with distortion, which becomes a real distraction that takes you out of scenes.  Has anyone else noticed this?
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	This movie was a waste of my time and money.  I'm a Indiana Jones fan but this movie was idiotic.  I would like to know what Spielberg's big fixation is with space aliens.  Could it be that he might of been  abducted and probed one too many times because it's finally showing in his latest work.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this garbage.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Very good.  Much is left out of the book.  Perhaps should have been broken in two. Some actions are never explained.<br /><br />Second disc great fun.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"I had no idea how much my 2 1/2 year old daughter would love this movie until we saw it.  She's seen it 5, yes 5, times now, and she gets more excited each time she sees it.  It's such a nice change of pace to watch an exciting well-made kid's movie.  The cg-graphics are spellbindingly awesome, and the cast of characters is unforgettable.  My girl ""acts out"" scenes from the movie with her die-cast cars every day."
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	"This is my wife and I's favorite Harry Potter movie to date. I would give the movie 5 stars if I was simply rating against the other Potter films and am excited this director has been handed Book 6.<br /><br />From there, I have a Samsung 61"" DLP and a top of the line 1080i upconvert DVD player.  It truly brings standard DVDs to close-near-HD levels.<br /><br />That said, this movie looks worse than a bootleg version on You Tube! I've never seen quality this bad in a DVD. Ever.  I said to my wife, Warner Bros must really be trying to get people to jump on the HD formats because there's no way this just ""happened"".  I own 300+ standard DVDs and not one of them looks this bad. Not even close. In the opening of the movie, faces are distorted so bad that it looks like they've all been burnt with a waffle iron with noise distortion halos around the heads.<br /><br />We stuck in Goblet of Fire just to make sure we weren't exaggerating on the poor transfer quality. Goblet looked stunning.  Bottom line, this wasn't an accident.<br /><br />Shame on you Warner Bros!  Until there is a clear victor in Blue Ray and HD DVD, this consumer is buying standard DVD and to manipulate buyers by degrading the quality of your product on purpose is bad form...."
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	I am a huge Harry Potter fan and enjoyed every word of every book.  But I absolutely hated this movie.  I know a movie can never capture all of the details and character development of a book, but it still needs to stay true to the essence of the book we all have come to love.  This movie depicted Dumbledore as a very grumpy, almost mean, old man who displayed none of Dumbledores lovable qualities.  The movie destroyed the relationship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.  It depicted Ron and Hermione as stiff cardboard figures that stood behind Harry and looked concerned. I could go on and on with things that disturbed me about this movie.  But if you are a Harry Potter fan, you will have to watch it.  But this fan was extremely disappointed.
B001G2MB2G	3.0	b	Even though I am a Harry Potter fan, I like to get the two disc special editions for the extras alone. This edition let me down. All it was were the specials from HBO that most have already seen.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff is very funny.  His opening, without the puppets, was fantastic. He could do a whole routine without the puppets, he is that good.  His show is very organized and he knits the comments together and presents a great package.  I can't wait for his next release.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Mine loaded in less than 2 minutes and played fine on my Panasonic BD Player. Good Blu-Ray movie.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Okay, so I had only seen a few episodes before I bought this set as a gift for my sister. I liked what I had seen but have now actually sat down and watched 3 episodes so far and I'm hooked! lol..only thing I don't like about the show is all the nudity/sex scenes. There seems to be quite a lot of them, so if that is something that bothers you whenever you watch shows then this definitely isn't an item for you! :P Other than that, I still like the Twilight series, but this show portrays vampires in a more realistic way than on those movies.
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Another great film from the Coen brothers.Fast moving, full of surprises, and a decent commentary on today's ""drug wars"" , south of the border , down Mexico way.<br />Bardem...spooky and remorseless, Brolin...greedy,not so smart and predictable....Tommy Lee Jones...apparently to old and no stomach for today's violent criminals.<br />A movie not for the weak of heart and stomach...I  loved it. By the way, if you find a ton of money in the middle of a heap of dead bodies you better have a good plan.<br />Brolin didn't...."
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	Due to the amount of detail, I 've always thought the Harry Potter books were better than the movies, but that not-withstanding, the story was easy to follow, and the ending was a definite cliff-hanger in preparation for the final chapter.........
B00447G29S	5.0	b	The Polar Express is awesome on blu-ray.  We had an old version on DVD.  The new version was a much better viewing experience.  As far as the movie goes; it is an excellent family movie.
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	I don't generally write reviews unless something is incredibly good, or it's incredibly bad.  In this case, it's shockingly bad.  For years I have had a true admiration for Ridley Scott's work, but this is something he simply should not have signed as his.<br /><br />In terms of plot, it's basically all over the place, goes from very good, to hmmmmfff ok, to seriously forgettable.  The initial setup is reasonably good, excepting the whitish alien drinking the black goo.  That whole scene does not make any sense at all, it's irrational, illogical and has no place in the movie, not even from an artistic point of view.  The same process could have been explained or hinted at in countless other more meaningful and rational ways.  From there on, until they hit the planet the movie is quite good and manages to set up a very promising number of possible situations and occurrences (but, none of the better possibilities are used or explored).  The mid part is completely disappointing as the movie does not manage to be coherent and come together, characters are poor to say the least, they don't develop at all(except when they die, they develop into pseudo zombies), and the character set is extremely chliche.  Seriously, no one with half a brain would choose such a crew to go on an interplanetary trip that is of such huge importance.  It simply makes no sense, characters are chosen for cheap effect, and not to help sustain or enhance the movie and underlying plot.<br /><br />The iconic darkness and silence from Alien are gone, and they would have made the movie so much better. Also, the multicultural chaos from Blade Runner is not present here either.  This movie is very clinical, and way too predictable.  The rest of the movie simply unwinds itself into incongruous and irrational scenes mashed together to fill up the allotted time.  An example of some of the grossly irrational parts is : How on earth does a football sized (recently birthed) alien squid come to grow into a 30 ft kraken, incredibly, this happens while its's locked inside a sealed medical room.  It logically begs the questions:  what did they feed it, or what did it feed on ???  I can understand and enjoy sci-fi movies bending or even bypassing some of physics basic rules and laws, but this is simply ridiculous.  Most of the crew is just cannon fodder, the death of Weyland is horribly lacking in creativity, the space jockey never speaks or does anything that could be deemed understandable, too many key points are simply inferred by the characters apparently from empty space with no real explanation as to how they came to that conclusion.  The space jockey in general is OK, but most of what happens is so irrational and illogical the movie seems more like a very bad sci-fi channel movie, with a bigger budget, than anything else.<br /><br />If I could I would send Mr. Scott a personal mail letting him know that this movie is simply unwatchable, not when he has Blade Runner and Alien to his credit.<br /><br />For a director that has produced arguably two of the best, if not the best two, science movies to date, this feels like going to a Michelin Star Rated restaurant only to find a Big Mac inside the cloche.  This movie is a high budget poorly thought out film that manages to seal the coffin of the Alien, and Alien related franchise.  I feel cheated and I am honestly very hurt by what has happened here, I was led to see this movie enticed by bits and pieces of clever marketing hinting at something much bigger, better thought out and that promised to the the true heir to the Ridley Scott Sci-fi legacy.  But all this was just a marketing ploy, for my money.<br /><br />I truthfully regret having seen this movie.  If you can, give it a miss, if you don't, you have been warned.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I liked this movie as it is very informative. Although I have to say that I was already aware of many of the malpractices shown especially in the meat industry for past couple of years and I have already made my choice for better life-style. But the movie doesn't give a solution for the dilemma of McDonald's $1 burger versus more expensive vegetables in the grocery stores -- especially for the poorer class.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Love it!!  We never laughed so hard.  Give me more!!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	Don't listen to the reviews be your own critic and see this film and you will know if it is good or not. But it is not scary it is more of a romance and drama.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	The product, DVD, was excellent and no problems were evident.  The movie itself, Order of the Phoenix, is one of the best of Harry Potter yet.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I thought this was done well, kept me interested and changed the way I buy my food. Although, I am not perfect; I think about what I am buying before I place it in my cart. It has been one month since I watched the movie and the changes I have made not only make me feel better, it is helping my pant size and hopefully will help change the industry. If you like this movie, I would also reccomend watching the future of food.
B00447G29S	3.0	b	"The movie is great, however the 3d version is not the greatest. I have found that the 3d version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" for home release had much better 3d effect. The Polar Express had double images and other weired effects. The cardboard glasses are not the most comfortable thing to wear. The plastic glasses you get when you go to the theater are much better.  To get the best effect for 3D at home you need to have your viewing room dark and the TV set to Standard mode not movie mode."
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	Great series! Not 100% true to the book, but close enough.  Interesting sub-plots added.  Highly recommend!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Great transaction.  The shipment was sent in a timely fashion and the item was exactly as described.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	If you want more Lafayette, you need to watch this in Enhanced Viewing.  Funny!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"If you are like me - very concerned about the garbage and leftist propaganda that Hollywood is bent on putting out, please consider this a movie safe for your family.<br /><br />Even though I am no fan of Tom Hanks and don't care of part of his past work (mainly 'Philadelphia'), he was actually quite a good voice over for the conductor.  The animation is outstanding.  The story is good.  It is heart touching and a bit of a tear maker.  I enjoy a good Christmas movie that can generate that kind of response.<br /><br />And they actually utter that politically incorrect and ever so offensive phrase, ""Merry Christmas"", a number of times in the movie....."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"All the kids in our family call this the ""choo choo"" movie. They were sad to see it go after Christmas. I found this for a steal on here!"
B0006989TE	3.0	b	M. Night Shyamalan has trouble finding his footing with his fourth feature film, and it becomes apparent about half way through that a man we once thought could become the next Hitchcock may end up nothing more than a one hit wonder.  The film as a whole was horribly miss-advertised, promoted as a thriller when it becomes a film more about loyalty and love than anything else.<br /><br />The twist ending, instead of impressing us and scaring us all the more (just think how you felt when you realized Bruce Willis was really dead, or when you realized Samuel Jackson was indeed a crazed killer...Goosebumps), ends up ruining everything that Shyamalan works so hard to establish in the films outset.  That's the biggest problem right there...you find out the twist ending to early...and then Shyamalan again tried to scare you and it comes off comical and campy, and campy is NOT what Shyamalan was going for, I'm sure of that.<br /><br />The beginning of this film, maybe even the first three quarters, is effectively ominous, but once the big secret is revealed all eerie overtones flee and they will never be repeated, so as a thriller this film falls flat on it's face for there is no way that this film will even be remotely scary the second time around.<br /><br />BUT...as a dramatic love story this movie actually works wonders (aside from the one campy chase scene in the woods that would have been much more effective had the `fake' looking quote-unquote creature remained hidden throughout).  The acting in this film is top-notch, and the chemistry between stars Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is undeniable.  Adrian Brody is successful in portraying the village handicap and Jayne Atkinson is wonderfully used as Ivy's (Howard) sister.<br /><br />This is why I'm so torn because my initial reaction is to hate this film for pretending to be something it's not, for tricking me into thinking I was going to have a spine-tingling good time and instead serving up a romance of sorts, but I can't get too upset for this romantic drama is actually a very good one.<br /><br />So, in closing, this is not the movie you think it's going to be, but that doesn't mean it's not a movie you should see.  I say everyone see for themselves, but watch with an open mind, knowing full well this is not another `Sixth Sense', not even another `Unbreakable' but it's something altogether different, altogether it's own and shows that while Shyamalan may have lost touch with what is truly terrifying, he still knows how to tell a story (aside from the horrendous `Lady in the Water').
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	"The original fits what Martin loves to make movies about but I would have hoped he presented the movie like how Guillermo Del Toro and now Quentin Tarantino do for the films they love to watch and support.  A good film buff friend of mine showed Infernal Affairs to me around the time it came out domestically and I fell in love as everyone else did.  Later I followed up with the prequel/sequels as they came out.  Very pleased and impressed since I loved Martin's crime stories and all.<br /><br />I encourage people to try watching the original Infernal Affairs trilogy with subtitles (if reading is hard for you then I'm sorry). The originals are great films otherwise you wouldn't ever get this remake. And in the original, Wai-keung Lau's (with Yiu-Fai Lai) work is more complimentary to Michael Chapman's style for those of you who loved Taxi Driver & Goodfellas. I like the style of the actor's work with the nice subtle vibe going on with the cinematography in the original that I always enjoyed in Martin's style in his films and with Michael Chapman work which was what i was expecting to feel but didn't (the film Bringing Out The Dead is a great film by the way).  Do note though, I am not hating on Robert Richardson. I like his work on Inglorious Bastards, The Good Shepherd and even the Horse Whisperer.  As a remake though, with the two films, I felt in the remake there were more moments forced that were not needed, then again it was pressing 3 films into one.  My main beef with the Departed is simply that its unecessary and over done in a subtle way which is a complimenting minus point or low passing grade in my books a D+.  With 3 movies in one, its longer than it needs to be.<br />!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!! (yes even for a remake)<br />I felt the death of SP Wong Chi Shing was more artistic and had a stronger impact than the death of Queenan...but in American cinema, sadly Actors can have a say on how they want their character's death scene handled in films and that part displeased me the most (I say this cause something was fishy with the narration of that scene).  The death of Wong Chi Sing was more of a shock and brought on a gun fight with lots of people involved that I was hoping The Departed would've went to town with like something from Heat, but no. I didn't get any suspense and there is a weird steady cam shot looking down on the action from whoever was holding it that felt very community college film class for a second.  Every other death scene had nice work put into it but this was a combination of over the top and under worked...all unnecessary. It was the scene I was excited for and curious on how America would top it but it didn't.<br />I felt the relationships with the female characters and the male leads were not forced as they were in the departed.  Lau Kin Ming (""Colin"") was married to a writer and her role was very nice and separated his good conscience from beyond the job conscience in another element that I felt Colin should have stayed with.  And my number one thing is that Billy was undercover for less than two years and Chen Wing Yan was undercover for ten years...so the stress and intensity of ten years compared to around 2 gave me less sympathy for Billy as the movie progressed, drama and all.  Dignam is brand new, never was there and so in the original there was no one to help after the shocker death scene which made it more intense for the hero to be alone. There are other differences but these are my personal main ones.<br /><br />It's sad that America can only bring in Asians kicking people to the big theaters and any other brilliant non martial arts work has to get copied.  I guess we cannot see Asians doing anything else...?  It would be nice to see original films in theaters like The Ring, My Sassy Girl,  City On Fire (Reservoir Dogs), Shall We Dancu, Anjaane (Strangers), Riding For Thousands Of Miles as examples.  At least make a re-imagination like Magnificent Seven was of Seven Samurai and Road to Perdition was of Lone Wolf & Cub...BONUS NOTE: I can't forgive Godzilla. So I am guessing one day we may see some version of Oldboy in America or The Man From Nowhere which had only one copycat scene from Dark Knight not like Priest which was a constant copycat scene filled film...not going there today! I do feel that if we can appreciate the same stories from other countries, why not appreciate that film instead of remaking it as if never to bother? Or we can only see what we so much of whatever from whoever?<br /><br />I don't usually like remakes much and I really don't like copycats (revamps are OK after a time/redemption). I wish Raging Bull or Taxi Driver brought Martin his past due award instead of a remake. Martin Scorsese is long past due many awards in the past.  I do give props to the film makers as they did credit the ones who made the story.  Film makers who copy some one else's work without giving credit like Sanjay Gupta (Diablo Cody is in question in my mind with her 'take' on Jeni Juno, innocent or guilty, I'm not sure, hmmmm).<br /><br />Remakes and copies that are not even re-imaginations or revamps sit weird with me.  This movie is cute and if you have never seen the original like any other remake, you may enjoy it.  Why compare the two films that have been brought up in my talks with film buddies is simpley because they are connected, one is a remake.  Gotta give props and credit for where credit is do.  Even if you do like the remake more than the original, thats cool too, but it still wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the original.<br /><br />3 Stars because it is a good film, just not original."
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"For those of you wondering ... yes, this is a prequel to the 1979 sci-fi hit <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011V8IQ"">Alien (The Director's Cut)</a>. However, it is notsomuch the origin of the Alien (even though that is included), but it is more of the origin story of the Weyland Corporation (from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation of the original ""Alien"" movie franchise) and his true obsessive reasoning for space exploration. The overall story structure of the film follows closely to the original ""Alien"" in regard to the fact that it starts out slow and appearing as some mere space exploration film, but then all hell breaks loose! Not much happens in the exact story, but the overall legend that this story adds to the Alien universe is essential! Plus, ""Prometheus"" has a scene involving a high-tech operation table where my jaw literally dropped; I couldn't believe that writers Lindelof (of TV's ""Lost"") and Spaihts went there! And just when you think, ""What's gonna happen now?"", the film answers your question but with one minor caveat (the ending is still somewhat open), and ultimately ends on a great note that will give film geeks that orgasmic feeling. Performances are wonderful, effects are even better and the alien design is exquisite! Kudos, Mr. Scott! Kudos."
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	This DVD was not at all what I expected. Scenes were deleted, and the one's added at the end would have been better inserted into the film at the theater. I was mildly disappointed by the removal of scenes that I had seen in the theatrical version. This DVD was not labeled as a modified version and should have been.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	The infomercial really grabbed me. After researching to verify it was legit, I purchased this through Amazon. I even used the 1-day shipping since I was anxious to get started. The fit-test demonstrated coldly that I was out of shape. But even after only a week, I could start telling some results.<br /><br />In fact, I don't see how it's possible NOT to see results with this program if you follow it.<br /><br />Tips:<br />- Buy a heart rate monitor, you'll learn quickly you need it and Shaun T will keep telling you to check your heart rate. You want to make sure it's not too high.<br />- Figure out your pace, which most likely is not the same as the cast. If you can keep a high heart rate (high but safe) and make it to the breaks, then you are doing great. 180 heart-rate is a reasonable cut-off point.<br />- Don't be afraid to pause. Shaun T reminds you in some DVDs this is interval training so 'make sure you recovery' before continuing so you are giving intensity.<br />- Buy a food scale so you're measuring accurate portions<br />- Do a 5-meal rehearsal day before starting if you're not used to eating 5 times a day. You need to plan out in advance what you'll be eating and how you'll manage that.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	Sin City is absolutely phenomenal. The acting is great and very reminiscient of older films, and the film has a dark, edgy, highly stylistic look to it (thanks undoubtedly to the comics, of course). Black and white with instances of color works really well for the film. I love the fact that two of Sin City's chapters (the first and the third one) have enough emotional depth to match their film noir feel. And the second chapter is just a balls-out action flick, and a sort of a nice respite from the other stories. For some it might seem out of place, but it worked great for me.<br /><br />I can't say enough great things about Sin City. It's just that good.
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	This is like watching an accompanying movie for a Disney ride or something, its seems really shoddy. Best example is the scene where Marion and Indy start sinking in quicksand. Just watch that awful scene, even if it was in an older Indy movie it would have at least looked better. Is it the lousy LEGO sets? The bright cheery color scape (where the EPIC shadowing go?) could be a problem as well maybe? Or the fact the movie is one CGI gag after another, THIS IS NOT STAR WARS. TRY TRY TRY TRY to make it somewhat believable, a slow thoughtful pace doesn't hurt either, and oldschool un-ridiculous flesh and blood stunts are nothing to be ashamed of, and a semi serious attempt at story wouldn't have hurt either. This was like a terrible big budget sitcom, only you know the budget didn't make it any better. Go You Tube the Indy Tribute movie made by those two kids on VHS tape over a span of 13 years or more, from when they were little to 20 something, its far more stunning than this.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I am not a Kristen Stewart fan and for that reason I almost missed watching this movie. The effects were great. I really like the way the creatures and people were portrayed. The dwarfs were dwarfs as I had always pictures them. Same with the fairies and the trolls. The evil queen was fantastic. The huntsman was well played. Great story.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	The first of Jeff's releases.  I actually watched the second one before I saw this one.  Walter is hysterical in this show, and Peanut is as entertaining as ever, although he is stronger in the second show.  Nontheless, this is worth purchasing.  Jeff Dunham is brilliantly entertaining.
B002VRZEYM	3.0	b	I wish I could find a DVD on GM foods that didnt have an agenda.... this one obviously does<br /> Monsanto is driven by profit and has many things to answer for, but they were presented here as a Disney villan. I would like a video I can use in an Environmental Science classroom that sticks to the facts and the science, presents all aspects of the situation and gets off the soapbox... this is not that video. It is also of low interest to high school students - I show it since I have nothing better ( any suggestions?), but it is certainly lacking.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"I loved Harry Potter from the start. But this movie need a really dark room with little or no lights on. It is a very depressing Movie. I still think that Harry (older, later) should marry Hermione. Glad to see Ron grow up a lot<br />The entire series were amazing but this and the Half Blood Prince were by far te most depressing.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XHY"">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1</a>"
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham might be one of the funniest comedians out there. His antics with his puupets are priceless.To give some idea of how funny this guy really is, every person I've shown this movie to has doubled over in laughter more than once while viewing it. If you love great standup, this dvd is definitely worth every penny.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	bought this for my 2 year old son on is birthday and we have yet to stop watching it. Absolutely loved the movie and I do as well.
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	Unfortunately, there is way too much of an effort of this film to get laughs. The sarcasm is over the top. The film, apparently, was directed at a much younger audience, who care more about fast-paced action than a intricate plot.The special effects were way overboard and took away from any real storyline and/or dialogue. Entertaining, perhaps, but in my opinion this series has come to a screeching hault.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	This DVD is too dark.  More than 50% of the picture/movie/DVD are dark scenes and you can not make-out the picture/s.  Sound is OK but the video/picture is bad.<br /><br />Again - it is too dark of a DVD to see/enjoy.  If you enjoy watching a black screen/TV No picture) - this is the DVD.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"Had not Lexus thought of it first, Pixar could've adopted the motto ""the relentless quest for perfection"" -- especially on this movie. From the story line to the voiceovers to the exquisitely fine details (including the in-jokes) of the animation, CARS is a flat-out winner, and only NASCAR fanatics (of which I am not one) could possibly care that some racing rules are conveniently ignored here and there.<br /><br />I am SO glad that the animators didn't stop at the stiffer, more photo-realistic level of animation we saw in an early trailer; ""humanizing"" the cars by giving them the facial and body expressions required comprise just the touch that was needed. Most stunning to me was the near-photo-realistic animation of the mountains, trees and waterfalls in a high pass (which actually made Pixar's rendering farm crash at first) -- it's so breathtaking that it really needs widescreen formatting to do it justice.<br /><br />After I saw it in the theater, I exclaimed, ""I may never look at a car in the same way again!"" I'm betting that your whole family will feel the same way."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Perhaps the best one yet (apart from the first one). Once again need to have read the book first as there is so much more in that and it would be easy to get confused if you didn't know the why's and wherefors.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	My grandson and the rest of the family found ourselves not being able to pull ourselves away from watching this movie over and over.Great buy and fast shipping.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	A long held tradition on the side of those with lots of emotion and little to say has been to insult the other side.  Here you find more than an hour of laborious, droning, brow-beating insults to the mountains of evidence science has provided for a model of the universe that does not need an intelligent creator.  Meanwhile, the film does nothing to support its own claims that an alternative argument has any merit at all.<br /><br />Be not fooled; when it's not making false conflations and comparing anything and everything to Hitler's regime (Ben, you should be ashamed of yourself for belittling the suffering of millions so you can turn a buck and pander to those who mock education!), it's clobbering you with clumsy imagery and ad-hominems.<br /><br />Spare yourself suffering, cost and loss of time.  There are much better ways to hear the weak arguments against a material universe.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham doesn't disappoint! He can make most anyone laugh and laughing is good for your health.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	You will become hooked after the first episode!  As a Trubie... I have nothing but good things to say about this series.  Excellent story line, sexy characters and every episode leaves you on the edge of your seat.  Great Entertainment!!
B001684L0A	3.0	b	I have read the book, listened to the audio too while traveling and ultimately viewed the DVD HBO series. When the DVD arrived I was really excited to view it. However, after the first two episodes of the series, the series definitely took the darker and gloomy side of Adams. The book overwhelmingly displayed a more humorous man and certainly more caring man for his family -- especially toward his children. The series left me more in doubt of the connection between the author's view and the director's view of Adams. The author saw more of the human, where as the director seem to portray Adams as a maniacal man bent on paranoia and selfishness.<br /><br />Our education system of the 60's didn't even come close to revealing the tremendous work Adams had in our independence. David McCullough did an outstanding job of revealing the 'real' father of our country... John Adams... thank you Mr. McCullough! You're honest and clear portrayal of John Adams opened my eyes and magnified my appreciation for what he did to liberate the American people from the chains of the monarchies of the past.<br /><br />The other revelation that came as a result of reading the book is the almost full circle we have made in just 200 years! The blood, tears and treasure spent to free us from oppression, the same oppression is slowly being over shadowed by the abundance of the aristocracy and monarchs of our time. Slowly they are eroding the liberty that our forefathers won and established. As amendment after amendment is added to their Constitution, it is slowly evolving into another document where the liberty to pursue our happiness is slowly stolen from us and taxation without representation has revived its parasitical head.<br /><br />After listening to the wisdom of those gifted men of our newly formed nation, I have found that we American people have become a very ignorant offspring...<br /><br />Where are the Adams like Statesmen of our day?!
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	This is an AWESOME movie!  I will watch it again and again!  My whole family loved it!  I do not recommend it for young children though.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	"*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />To be uncharacteristically succinct, I think ""The Village"" was an inept blend of ""The Truman Show"", ""The Twilight Zone"", ""The Prisoner"", and ""Scooby Doo"" (the elders would have gotten away with it too, were it not for the meddling kids Lucius and Ivy). Admittedly, its themes of secure utopia (and the lengths people will reach to preserve it) and the ""woods as labyrinthine hell"" metaphor were intriguing and thought-provoking, but I felt M. Night Shyamalan's framework for presenting these themes was too contrived, attenuated, silly and inconsistent to be effective. As a 30-minute ""Twilight Zone"" episode, the premise would have had more shocking impact. As a feature-length movie, it appeared amateurish and pretentious instead, with too many plot and logic holes. Perhaps Mr. Shyamalan should have presented his themes in a straightforward way, without ""the past is really the present"" or ""it was Earth all along - god damn you all to hell"" twist, and really achieved the ultimate twist of having no twist.<br /><br />One can forgive a movie's lapses in logic if they are infrequent and the movie is basically intelligent and entertaining, but I felt ""The Village"" is truly neither. The dialogue is self-consciously excruciatingly stilted, the characters' actions stupefying (i.e. Lucius has been stabbed twice in the abdomen; his life is dribbling away, will SOMEBODY get the medicine already? and ""Ivy, get down in the cellar already?""), the ""monsters"" shoddily anthropomorphic and the ending inert. I did like the atmosphere and cinematography, however, but it was small compensation for this ""house of cards"" movie. To play devil's advocate for a moment, perhaps Mr. Shyamalan deliberately and perversely made his movie imperfect to inspire thoughtful commentary and discussion (is THIS the ultimate twist?)<br /><br />Now I present a list of plot/logic lapses designed to prompt ""You Gotta Be Kiddling Me"" responses:<br /><br />1. Could even a billionaire arrange to prevent airplanes from flying over the woodlands preserve?<br /><br />2. Those poles the villagers were painting the mollifying color yellow sure looked like telephone poles.<br /><br />3. Would you put a monster suit in a cellar where the village idiot would have ready access to it?<br /><br />4. Would any rational, humane person send a blind girl (no matter how stereotypically pure and resourceful, since of course blind people are always above reproach, unflinchingly brave, and possess extrasensory perception - is she Daredevil's daughter?) alone into the woods for medicine? That is cruel and unusual punishment violating the 8th amendment!<br /><br />5. To protect the ""idyllic"", ""pristine"" village from the encroachment of evil civilization, wouldn't you need an army of security personnel? Only one appears in the movie and, even though he's apparently a novice, he seemed useless.<br /><br />6. Cut off from the outside world, how can the village sustain itself for any period of time? Wouldn't the inhabitants go mad being restricted to the village limits? Curiosity will ultimately surmount fear.<br /><br />7. As my friend Joe Flynn, who watched the movie with me, said, ""Wouldn't some stoned teenagers trespass into the woodland preserve and stumble upon the village?"" Exactly.<br /><br />Still, in its klutzy way, ""The Village"" does stimulate thought, which is more than you can say for many movies that are otherwise more efficient and entertaining!"
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	While it is arguable that the story in this film is the best yet, the quality of action and adventure is unmatched.<br />For those who watch movies on the PC, this version comes with a free downloadable digital version that can be viewed on a computer.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	This is the darkest movie of the whole series. With this effect your sitting at the edge of your seat the entire time. Every unexpected move makes you jump. You look at the characters faces and you know they are unhappy and this is going to be more like a thriller than an action/adventure although it is that too.<br />The only thing that I don't like is Rupert Grint. He's not that great of an actor. In this movie all he seems to do is stand in the background and look sulky. Ron isn't supposed to be that way. Oh well! I suppose I would be unhappy if they changed him!<br />All in all, this is the best movie!! Watch it, love it, and watch it some more!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I could write many things about this film, but I'll save everyone the eyestrain. Just watch it, but don't violate Russ' first rule of movie watching.<br /><br />Lower your expectations, have a few beers, and enjoy.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	I've enjoyed all of his films, however, to varying degrees. They all have had features, scenes or elements that truly shined. However, people have come to expect bizarre and unusual surprise plot twists and/or revelations at the end of the film and if someone is not truly taken aback or shocked at the ending of the film I think that results in a lukewarm review. Truth be told &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was the only mainstream film he has done which had a big shocker/revelation at the end of the film. &quot;Signs&quot; seemed to me to deal more with the idea of lost faith and how fate, (providence or God), causes things to happen for a reason and makes people be where they are for a reason, (remember Gibson's brother who washed out of professional baseball and the son with asthma and how both of those conditions were in the end for the benefit of the characters). &quot;Unbreakable&quot; I found simply to be a fun movie exploring in a very real everyday way how a grown family man comes to the realization and terms with the fact that he is a superhero. &quot;The Village&quot; certainly has a twist at the ending, however, it was one that I suspected about 25 minutes into the film. This does not detract from the overall story and the quality of the film. The movie has great performances from some great performers and manages to provide a few chills, (without the necessity of the blood and gore that makes it into far too many of our films). Shyamalan may becoming a victim of his own success; the fact that a few films of his have had &quot;revelations&quot; or &quot;twists&quot; I think has encouraged viewers to expect them and anticipate them. Moreover, if the &quot;revelation&quot; or &quot;twist&quot; doesn't measure up somehow than the armchair critics bash the film. My advice: Go see the film solely for the purpose of being entertained and watching some excellent performances and maybe, just maybe, being surprised and given a few goose bumps here and there.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	This is a fun movie . . . my son and I were enthralled throughout.  Love getting the two-disc edition . . . lets us watch anywhere in the house.  Really looking forward to Iron Man 2.<br /><br />Amazon, as usual, shipped quick and sent exactly what we expected!
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	Longest Book but Shortest Film, or How To Turn a 766 page Phoenix into a 128 minute Turkey.<br /><br />Yes, the film, including credits, actually runs 138 minutes.  But the book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, is 766 wonderful pages long, from perhaps the best, certainly the most popular writer to bridge the gap between children's writing and adult writing, J.K. Rowling,<br />A pity that the same cannot be said for the poor wretch Michael Goldenberg who took this wonderful book, cut out almost all the supporting characterisation, and turned in a script which concentrates exclusively on Harry Potter in the least satisfying of the films so far.  Where was Steve Cloves, who did such a fine job with the first four screenplays?  One wonders why J.K. Rowling let this script pass.  Perhaps she gave up the right of script approval.  Perhaps she no longer cares, now that the series of books is finished, and she is wealthier than the Queen.<br />Brilliant, flashing, but hokey special effects dazzle the viewer, but waste so much of the film's running time, that all the supporting characters get short shrift.  Hagrid is almost absent.  The little brat Malfoy has almost disappeared.  Hogwarts itself doesn't look the same as it has in most previous films.  Even the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix don't live up to the book: the screaming portrait is gone, and Kreatcher, the Black house elf gets so little screen time he might as well not be there.  Tonks has about two lines.<br />The Ministry of Magic scenes which feature so prominently in the book are minimal in the film.<br />The whole film has also been printed so dark that one needs to turn up the brightness control to see any of the details of the sets.  Maybe Warners couldn't afford to build sets with enough detail to be seen with proper lighting.  Maybe Warners doesn't care any more, as long as the money keeps rolling in.<br />Director David Yates did the best he could with a sorry travesty of a screenplay, but even he couldn't pull this one out of a hat.  One hopes for better results with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince which he is directing for release later this year, 2008.  Good news though, Steve Cloves has written the screenplay.<br />Too bad that Chris Columbus has bowed out of the production.  Too bad that Director of Photography Roger Pratt, who so brilliantly photographed the second and fourth films didn't do this one.<br />The bottom line: rent this one, don't waste your money buying it.  Read the book, if you haven't already.

B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is the second Jeff Dunham special filmed and the 1st one I saw. This was filmed in Washington DC. Walter, Peanut (I've gone purple), and J. Jose Jalapeno on a Stick return to the stage. We are introduced to 2 new characters. A guy who has limited powers and hates Pinochio, Melvin the Superhero Guy. Next is a terrorist. I don't know if he was an accomplished terrorist but I do know he managed to blow himslef up. That's right I'm talking about Achmed the Dead Terrorist. The only character I'm glad who isn't back is Bubba J (I hate him most). I look forward to watching this movie and the Christmas Special.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	Purchased Harry Potter over the holiday because i couldn't pass up the price.  It is an excellent movie to enjoy on blue ray.  i am extremely please with my purchase and would recommend it highly for anyone who is adding to their blue ray collection.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	"One of the biggest problems that I had watching this show on Comedy Central was that I laughed so hard I missed half of the jokes so I had to watch it over again! I first saw Jeff Dunham on one of the talk shows years ago and I remembered Jeff's 3 main stars, Walter, Peanut, and Jose Jalepeno (On A Steek). I remember praying that I would get a chance to see this great ventriloquist again and finally my prayer's are answered. After years of getting laughs from vulgarity riddled standups from the likes of Red Foxx, Eddie Murphy, and Andrew Dice Clay, I finally can have a stand up comedy that is hilarious and I can watch with my children.<br />In this standup, Jeff introduces 2 new friends, Bubba J and Sweet Daddy Dee who are as funny as  the other 3. Bubba is a bucktoothed,beer belly redneck who is hysterically strereotyped as such, Sweet Daddy Dee is Jeffs new manager who insists he's Jeff's pimp. Though both new characters are hysterical, Walter (the grouchy old man) and Peanut (you would swear he's on speed), and Jose Jalapeno(On A Steek)are still my favorites.One of the greatest strengths of Jeff is his ability to bring forth totally different personalities as if 5 different comedians are voicing for each. Jeff jokes are funny and best of all, done in good taste.<br />All I can say to anyone who's not interested in this video is ""Your Loss"". These are 6 funny dudes you'll miss out on or is it 1 funny dude with 5 puppets?"
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	This item arrived in Great condition and came in a timely manner!  I would buy from this site in the future!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This series is very well-casted; well photographed; well documented. If you enjoy History, you will love this.
B001G2MB2G	4.0	b	I am a huge Harry Potter fan. I think the characters should stay just as they are. The actors are getting older but so are the characters in the book. My dilema is the movie has left out a lot of stuff. They shortened the fight and some other things. If you have not read the book do so before watching the movie so you can fully understand. This was the longest of all the books and the shortest movie. I agree with the viewer who stated these books should be a mini series so we can get the full view.
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	This movie was only okay. It was entertaining enough while it was, on but a day after my husband and I watched it we could barely remember the plot. Two weeks after we watched it my husband forgot that we had already seen it<br />(which says a lot about the movie) That being said, if you are looking for a diversion you will be entertained but it definitely isn't a film that you will be excited to talk about once it's over.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	I'd give this a five if Shyamalan would deign to give commentaries on all his movies. If you've got a VHS, get a cheap used copy cuz there ain't nuthin extra on the DVD.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	My 1st purchase through Amazon and it went smoothly. I pre-ordered and they shipped in advance. got it 3 days ahead of schedule, on the release date. Great thing to come home to after a hard days work. :) I followed this show when it 1st aired last fall. If you are interested in another take in vamp history (so-to-speak) then you'll enjoy this show. All the characters are great and played very well by the actors. Can't wait to start season 2!! :D
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I loved True Blood from the first episode, and this DVD set was like a cool breeze on a hot day. It's filled with all sorts of extra features and brilliant commentary. I highly recommend this show and this DVD set to anyone with or without a pulse.
B001KZG99A	1.0	b	"Its 9-30 and Iron Man is OUT on Blu-Ray! What could go wrong?<br /><br />Oh... DISK 1 FAILS TO LOAD?!?!?! - This is a KNOWN ISSUE...????<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Here is what was said:<br /><br />""<br />by Wayde Robson -- last modified September 25, 2008 18:28<br />Iron Man on Blu-ray - May Have Dodged a Missile<br /><br />In true super-hero style - Iron Man might have narrowly avoided a near disaster. No, it wasn't an explosive missile from his arch-nemesis in the film, Iron Monger played by Jeff Bridges. Instead it was something that could have been devastating for the film's Blu-ray release and possibly delivered a spot of damage to the Blu-ray format overall.<br /><br />It seems retailers carrying Iron Man on Blu-ray, set for release on Sept. 30, are enduring an eleventh hour recall from Paramount. Considering Iron Man was one of the biggest blockbusters of the summer, the splashy special effects film is perfect for Blu-ray's high definition picture quality and Dolby True HD 5.1 lossless audio. It could have been a real set-back for the format itself at this critical juncture as Iron Man could be one of Blu-ray's break-out titles.<br /><br />Due to an apparent authoring problem with the disc Paramount has recalled the Blu-ray version of Iron Man from retailers. Rumor has it the problem was with disc 1 playing back in certain Sony Blu-ray players.<br /><br />The studio received reports of compatibility issues with review copies that had been sent out weeks ago. Distributors have only recently been told to send back all copies of the disc. As a result Paramount has stated that it may have to delay the title's release date to October 7.<br /><br />While a one week delay for the Blu-ray release date may not seem like much, especially after the Godfather Trilogy's release this week - which should keep many BD fans busy, if Paramount decides to go ahead with the DVD release on schedule it will almost certainly hurt Blu-ray sales.<br /><br />But according to some sources, the word from Paramount is that the studio is working around the clock and determined to meet the official release date of Sept. 30. Some have even reported that they've already received a fixed copy of the Iron Man Blu-ray disc so it looks like old ShellHead might have dodged a damaging projectile that wasn't in the script.""<br /><br />Amazon did an Excellent job in sending out a replacement disk - BUT -<br />I now fear that any replacement will also have this Issue...<br />(5 Star Support - Thanks Amazon)<br /><br />USE CAUTION WHEN YOU BUY THIS MOVIE ON BLU-RAY!<br /><br />FYI: I am using a PS3 80GB as my player and online update confirms I have the latest firmware!<br /><br />Buyer-Be-Ware."
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	As we've loved all the HP movies, and as I recently purchased a blu-ray player, this seemed like an excellent way to test out both the new player, the new screen, and get the newest of the movies. We were NOT disappointed. The clarity of detail is simply amazing. Tiny, intricate details (often in the distance or background) that would normally be lost in fuzzy obscurity on a DVD shine through with brilliance in this film. The film itself is wonderful, and probably the best of the bunch so far, with masterful editing going into taking such a long and complex book and condensing it into such a short film without losing too many of the important details. Highly recommended!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	I'm amazed by the negativeness of some of the reviews.  It could be that this movie was mispublicized, and led some people to expect something else.  It isn't a thriller.  It's languidly paced, and very human.  It does have a twist, of course.  People watching it for the twist, or for monster attacks, or some such thing, are probably going to get bored waiting for the ending, and they'll miss the fact that the movie itself, all the way through, is wonderful.  I can't even explain why.  I'm enamored with the colors; I could watch the movie with the sound off.  I'm enamored with the decent and meaningful way in which the lead characters interact.  It's just a good movie.
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	"Okay, first off if you own a Web Enabled Blu-ray player like a PS3, you're going to have to wait a long time before you can watch this Blu-ray after you pop it in. Why? Some pinhead executive at the movie studio/blu-ray production house thought it would be cute to require you to download some stupid software you're probably not going to use for ""extra features""  BEFORE you can even get to the main menu. I had to wait so long to watch it I thought the disc was defective. I had enough time to call Amazon and arrange a replacement. (Then I installed installed Windows XP to my MacBook and I was still waiting. If you've ever installed XP you know how long that takes too.) This means that each time I pop this Blu-ray into a new player, like if I take it to a friend's house,  I'm going to have to tell my friend(s): okay let's just wait an hour then we can watch the movie. This is completely and totally absurd. I hope whoever decided this was a good idea gets fired.<br /><br />After about an hour and a half, I was able to watch this movie though. It's a really great movie. It's right up there with WALL*E and The Dark Knight. It has a very fun comic book feel to it, while not being absurdly stupid. If you can suspend your disbelief for 120 some odd minutes, it's a great ride.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is a great Tony Stark. When I first heard he was cast as Iron Man, I thought ""yeah right! This movie's gonna suck."" But I was very wrong. He pulls off the ladies man/billionaire playboy/hot shot role very well. But this is only half of the movie: The other half: Iron Man action scenes are just flat out cool. The poses/angles they choose and CGI work are all great. This is a first rate production.<br /><br />Also, I didn't know who his assistant was before the credits rolled  but she looked familiar (Turns out it was Gwyneth Paltrow) and she made a really interesting character too, for a supporting role. You even have Jeff (""The Dude"") Bridges in there doing a great job playing Stark's second in command.<br /><br />Oh, and when the credits roll, don't turn off the movie. There's a little scene after all the credits that fans of the comics and fans of this movie shouldn't miss.<br /><br />Summary:<br />The Blu-Ray gets a 1 star for the incompetence of whomever decided it was a good idea to make people download something before they could even see the main menu.<br /><br />The Movie Gets 5 Stars for great execution - cast/acting, storyline, effects, and action scenes. Dare I say: This is the best Marvel Comics movie to date."
B001OHS8BQ	3.0	b	I saw this movie in the theatre with a group of people from my church. At the time I enjoyed it very much, because it addressed issues that so many people struggle with, in a thoughtful and Biblical manner. It also had a few funny moments, and a good overall message.<br /><br />However, I cannot discount a lot of the truly bad acting in this movie, most notably Kirk Cameron's dad, the woman who played Catherine, and ESPECIALLY ESPECIALLY that doctor whom she ends up having an affair with. They were supposed to be having a steamy affair, but there was acsolutely ZERO chemistry between them whatsoever, and the whole thing just seemed contrived. Catherine just ended up being annoying to me. That doctor is probably the worst actor I have ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />I own the DVD, simply because it was given to me, and I do enjoy it from time to time, but the horrible acting from many of the characters really takes away from the effect of this movie.
B008M4HANQ	1.0	b	Pros:<br /><br />Started off really well<br />Darker tone of the snow white story<br />Some actors were really great and did all they could to make the movie better<br />Had some creative ideas<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The movie went nowhere after she met the horseman(just alot of filler)<br />The fight scenes in this movie were atrocious<br />Kirsten Stewart's character was never trained to fight and it seemed silly when she threatened to beat the queen<br />The fight at the end of the movie was so anti climatic<br />The ending was weird, was snow white going to marry the huntsmen or just stare at him creepily while the credits roll<br />Even though this movie was made for adults, at times it seemed more childish in tone than the children's adaptions of snow white<br />The relationship between the queen and her brother almost seemed incestious and made it uncomfortable when they were on screen together<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The movie had a great start and overall dark tone with some great actors doing their best to make the movie enjoyable but this movie falls flat with lackluster action and abrupt ending that left you wondering why snow white kept staring so hard at the huntsman as if she wanted to do something other than just stare until the credits roll. 1/5 stars.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"As written in my blog: http://mineswallpaper.blogspot.com/<br /><br />I recently saw the HBO production of ""John Adams"". This epic of a rental engaged me with both education and entertainment through exploding sensory images and sounds, and poignant characterizations.<br /><br />As was the expectation, I found the movie series' display of Revolutionary life to be fascinating, offering viewers a glimpse into everyday life situations. After all, many in our generation would never stop to realize that an outdoor well's faucet may freeze over during winter months, thus rendering people waterless. Women today who suffer from Breast Cancer cannot imagine what could be worse than the stale, cold procedures they currently must endure. In fact, what could be worse is having your breast excised from your body without any anesthesia, such was purportedly done to Adam's daughter.<br /><br />I consider myself relatively learned on Adam's life, though by no means a scholar. I've read multiple historical biographies of Adams' peers, including those of Hamilton, Jefferson and Washington, which has by default educated me on President Adams. I found the HBO production quite parallel with almost all that I know of Adams, however I always imagined the rivalry between Adams and Jefferson to be much more fierce than displayed in the mini-series (so as to warrant Adams' famed final words ""Jefferson survives."")<br /><br />Giamatti and Linney's performances were stellar so that by the film's end I could envision nobody else portraying either character. Giamatti's version of Adams to me, gently illustrated Adams' quirks and tendencies toward perfection. Although Adams' high-strung personality was adequately displayed, the character was more than human and very identifiable.<br /><br />Linney's performance required her to play Abigail in a very reserved fashion, which was brilliantly executed. Although I suspect that Mrs. Adams was as forthright as was portrayed, Linney's performance required her to adapt the character somewhat so that modern audiences would respect her."
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	great dvd - entertaning for adults & peacekeeper for my 2-1/2 yr old grandson.<br />Sane in Seattle
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"This movie is the story of how a billionaire playboy becomes a superhero in a metal supersuit. It takes you through a man's epiphany of his role in a destructive system to his initiation of a system of protection and justice. Because...he's Iron Man. :)<br /><br />IRON MAN was not one of my fave comics growing up in...er...many years ago. I was more into the X-Men and Daredevil and The Flash and The Fantastic Four and Doctor Strange. When I heard they were making Iron Man as a film with Downey, my first thought was, ""Huh? Downey?""<br /><br />I should accept that when someone can act, they can ACT just about any role. Downey can act. (I always feel a little sad that so much time and energy was sapped by his substance abuse demons, when he could have been playing many more roles.) He proves it by being a believable playboy genius who grows up fast under some great pain and duress when, on a trip to Afghanistan, he becomes a prisoner. From there, the billionaire boink-fiend becomes a man with a...heart. In more ways than one.<br /><br />The second star of the movie is the special effects for the suit. OH MY GOSH! I want one. They managed to make the laughable bright suit I remember from my comics-riddled youth into something cool and effective and...sexy.<br /><br />The effect of his ""heart"" is also quite nifty, though less complex.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is somehow lacking her usual shine and spark here, but she isn't ineffective. I just know she can do better--and I like her a lot--and I was slightly disappointed that she was so, so...not up to Downey in this.<br /><br />POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS follow...you are warned:<br /><br />I didn't like Bridges as the corporate baddie. (Oh, come one. We all know he's the baddie from the first scene, right?) I find he's an actor who's either very on and works, or who's very off and sucks. I think he pretty much sucks here except for one scene. Ah, well.<br /><br />On the plus side, there is humor (Stark's quips and sarcasm and sass is irrepressible) to go with the dark stuff (ie, torture, violence, death, corruption, and so forth). The robot helper is a hoot.<br /><br />Another plus is Terence Howard as the military cutiepie friend of Tony Stark. He manages to be low-key, strong, and effective in his role with very few lines. He even manages to be funny. I like this actor very much.<br /><br />The sets work very well. You get the feeling that Stark really is not only a genius, but sui generis from the environment: His workroom, garage, home--all spectacular. And I do believe it's a Gehry structure in one scene (or a great facsimile of one.)  The reactor is displayed as a wonderful visual nod to the retro science fiction some of us still remember with great nostalgia.<br /><br />The direction is quite good: It has energy like mad when it needs it. It works with Downey's face and buffed-up bod in some highly potent close-ups and angles. But it's not something that is so feverish that you can't feel a decent change of pace. And it's not so showy that the camera becomes the star. At all times, Tony Stark/Downey is the star.<br /><br />When you buy/rent/watch this, make sure to either  sit through the credits (read a magazine, like I did while waiting to see if any goodie extras show up), or fast forward through them, because after the scrolling's done, you get a very brief scene in Stark's mansion where another superhero shows up...and it'll make fans of a particularly cool Hollywood actor holler. (I hollered.) Now I'll count the weeks until Iron Man II comes out.<br /><br />Oh, yeah.<br /><br />And for those who used to watch the Iron Man cartoon on TV aeons ago, you'll hear snatches of the theme song (the really dorky theme song, yes) that's sort of Sinatra-ed up here and altered for a phone ringtone there. Cute.<br /><br />Now, excuse me. I have the old Iron Man comic that tells the origin story, and I'm gonna go read it and see how it compares.<br /><br />Mir"
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Now this was a great movie, they did an awesome job with it and everyone I know enjoyed watching this movie.  There was someone here who mentioned Full Screen. I just wanted to say Yo Dude spend for a better TV, Full screen cuts the original format and you are only seeing part of the film. And this Movie is one where you don't want to miss anything. The increase size is probably for the flying scenes where they need more room to show off the Suits abilities. This movie is Iron Man after all. (no disrespect intended) A great example of what I am talking about would be the difference between the full screen and wide screen versions of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The scene where Indy and his father are driving the motorcycle. You miss so much of the interaction between the two in the Full Screen Version.  But review is about Iron Man so back to the review. The acting was great and Robert Downey Jr looks just like Stark in the comics.  The suit is awesome and the special effects added nicely to the movie to help complement the scenes.  This movie is worth it.  If you liked the comics then you should like this movie.  Just sit back an enjoy. =^_^=
B0006989TE	1.0	b	This movie for one should be brought up on false advertising. This movie is no where near a horror. The most horrific parts of the movie are the plot twists. This is a boring slow moving movie with a sorry romance story. By the time the plot twist had came i wondered why the movie was still going. I am starting to think that M. Night Shyamalan got some kind of help on the Sixth sense. This will most likely be the last M. Night Shyamalan film i watch.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Really enjoyed this movie...good story line, the evil queen did a great job...somewhat dark and evil but my husband and teenage kids all liked it
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	A classic movie, as most of us already know. My nearly 3 year old kept seeing Cars merchandise and began to beg to watch the movie. To date, she had only enough attention span to stick with a 20 or 30 minute cartoon, but she held out to watch this entire movie. I wanted to rent it before buying to see whether it would actually hold her interest. It did! Good movie! My daughter also is very sensitive with any movie involving any person (cartoon person) or animal in the midst of any conflict or danger, but she managed not to get too emotionally involved since cars are the obvious source of all the drama in this movie. :)
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"This movie was both creepy and excellent; well-done and horrifying because it shows us, better than anything I've ever seen, exactly what America has become: a place where stalking evil thrives.<br /><br />Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem, is the ultimate, pure, psychopathic killer and conveys all the legendary traits of this sub-species of human with chilling conviction.  He doesn't just lack a conscience, he has his own ""code of honor"" that bids him to revile and destroy those poor humans who make their decisions based on emotion that Chigurh simply cannot understand except as a weakness, a flaw.<br /><br />The movie also depicts the state of our society very well - a society where money and greed lead to drugs and inhumanity to man, and are becoming more and more normalized, part of the landscape.  Meanwhile, Sheriff Ed John Bell, (played by Tommy Lee Jones, the ""old man"", talks about the fact that his country is not what it used to be and doesn't realize that it is just that the same evil still exists, it just wears a different face.  He worries about the drugs and the greed and the horror of what is going on without realizing that all of that is a product of the very government he fought for in WW II.  In the old days, the U.S. government did its dirty work in other countries or behind a mask; now, it comes home to roost. This is indicated by the fact that one of the hired killers of the drug cartel is a former military officer (Wells, played by Woody Harrelson) and the drug cartel itself is a ""big business"" with offices in a high-rise and an accountant. The fact that psychopathic behavior is increasing in America is remarked on by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell who, while reading a newspaper says:<br /><br />""Here last week they found this couple out in California. They rent out rooms for old people, kill'em, bury'em in the yard, cash their social security checks. Well, they'd tortur'em first, I don't know why. Maybe the television set was broke.""<br /><br />The ""regular guy"", Llewelyn Moss played by Josh Brolin, isn't a dummy, but he's no match for the real, live, stalking evil of a psychopath because he does have a conscience and he doesn't have the ability to think like a psychopath - totally without emotion.  In a sense, what happens between Moss and Chigurh is representative of what happens in general, in society, between psychopaths and normal humans, even very smart normal humans, especially when those normal humans think they can take on a psychopath alone. The same could actually be said about Chigurh's former colleague, Wells:<br /><br />Anton Chigurh: And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.<br />Carson Wells: You go to hell.<br />Anton Chigurh: Let me ask you something. If the rule you followed brought you to this, of what use was the rule?<br />Carson Wells: Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?<br />Anton Chigurh: You mean the nature of this conversation?<br />Carson Wells: I mean the nature of you.<br /><br />The psychopath: an unstoppable force of nature.  And that is how this movie depicts them; Agents of fate.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole movie struck me as a metaphor for the increase of psychopathy in our world and its corrupting effect on human society.  It's a horrifying, but accurate picture, and a lot of lessons can be extracted from ""No Country for Old Men"".  Recommended."
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	Pixar just can't make a bad movie.  They manage to make children's movies enjoyable for everyone while having adult undertones. This would have gotten 5-stars but the gitrdone killed it for me. Other than that one caveat, buy it.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	The movie was about what I expected from this type of movie. Not as predictable as I thought it was going to be.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Like new package, in its original box. I'm already seeing results after 3 weeks. Don't give up, but work towards lasting longer each time you do a session. Good technique and instruction provided. Love the option to play the sessions without music, so you can play your own tunes while running the program.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This is absolutely hilarious.  Did see the show on Comedy Central (edited version) but enjoyed the unedited much more enjoyable without the bleeps.  Jeff Dunham is a master and his characters, especially Walter and Peanut, are phenomenally funny!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"This movie, Food, Inc., should be seen by every american. We are being fed a bunch of lies, not to mention the real garbage we are putting in our mouths. This movie is so full of information, and all from the ""horses' mouth"", so to speak. You will know the truth about how our food is engineered, where it really comes from, and the huge problems arising from all of it. This should be shown in consumer education classes in every high school in the country. This film is absolutely excellent!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	Too bad I caught a cold the night before INSANITY arrived in the mail!  Can't wait to start working out!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Great documentary.  Very disturbing to think living in the USA this type of activity happens.  We should all be aware and educate ourselves on the food we eat, the products we use on our skin.  It's not what we eat it is what we absorb. Read labels.  Set priorities on using clean pure safe beneficial products in the marketplace today. Cheap is exactly that .... cheap and harmful to our bodies. I highly recommend watching this movie .... well worth it.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Well the seller was very fast and professional very good description and very accurate to the condition of the blue ray video.  Will do business again soon.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	the DVD is awesome..this guy has talent and is very artistically creative!!!!! This comedy is a must see......especially the Jalape&ntilde;o on a Sticka!!!!!
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	"It was every thing I hoped it would be. Downey is the Man! Who knew this would come from the guy that made ""MADE""? Neat trick. I'm waiting for the next one. Losing Howard is depressing, I like the other guy but I think those that start, should stay, I hate cast changes in midstream. Don't you? Still an entertaining movie a definite must see."
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	I honestly couldn't believe why people would give this movie such a bad score. Yea, it could have been better. But as every Sci-Fi fan knows, you get what you get. The visuals were awesome. The story could have been better as to why they were there in the first place. Something not funded by a major corporation by someone who was looking for his own personal fountain of youth. Oh this may contain **spoilers** by the way, but if you're reading this, then you may have already watched it.<br /><br />The movie is good, above average in my opinion from having watched Alien and Aliens. I know that this story ties into that same universe, albeit something new. The bottom line is, it could have been better; but it's Sci-Fi. As I said earlier, you get what you get! I gave it 3-stars for a couple reasons. 1) It was entertaining. 2) It deserved it. As plain as that.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This guy is the bomb!  Achmed the terrorist is too funny.  Great wit, fantastic puppets.  Get it.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	What is there to say?  Love Harry Potter!  This one was probably hard to make, since the book was very convoluted story plot. Great Job!!
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W7F5SS"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Widescreen Edition)</a><br />I enjoyed the movie when I took my grandson to see it. The wide screen video gives it all to you again."
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	What an amazing story!  Potter continues to be assaulted by the Dursleys and worse, it seems the whole world is now coming down on him.  Will Harry survive?  Will he have the strength and courage to carry on and over come the dark lord once more?  Yes he will with a little help from his friends.  The Order of the Phoenix is a story about drawing on the strength of love and friends to overcome those who are out to get you.  This movie will tug at your heart and reinforce that the good guys always win in the end.  If you love the other Harry Potter movies you will definitely love this one.<br /><br />Of course you must understand that I have not read the book because reading the book first tends to ruin the movie for me.
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	"It seemed like the writers/producers found it more necessary to film gratuitously murderous scenes than to work harder on the suspense angle.  It seems like when there was a chance for real suspense, it was over.  I would always say, ""they should have done that scene like this to make the suspense work more"".  And every time Chigurh killed an innocent person, I would be like, ""okay we get the point that he is cold blooded"".  This film had so much potential to me but fell short.  When it ended, my wife and I just said ""that was weird"".  I don't really recommend it.<br /><br />His beat goes on..."
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	Charlize Theron was excellent in this movie and the special effects rocked. Kristen Stewart was slightly better than her normal brooding self as well. Liked the spin on the classic fairy tale. Should have been more of a romance with Thor but then it would have been a chick flick and not the fantasy/action film it was.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"The DVD is the normal 1-disc version and the Dobby bokend is as pictured.  The bookend is not very heavy, so it would be fine to use with DVDs (as shown) or lighter books.  The black base he stands on does not go far under in the back, so it would probably not be suitable for use with heavier books.  Dobby is probably about 6"" tall.  I am very satisfied with this purchase as it was only a few bucks more than the DVD alone & I love the little house elf.  If you want all the extra interview stuff or bluray go with another version, but the extra novelty was worth it to me.  The special features on this DVD include additional scenes and language subtitles only, and it is in widescreen format.  Frankly I would anticipate some sort of collector pack being released when the last movie(deathly Hallows part II) comes out, so I will likely get all the years on bluray then."
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	Well I first saw Mr. Dunham on comedy central and was hooked right away. I have 3 of his dvds now and enjoy sharing them with friends. What a riot. I am looking into getting tickets to see him in person, i mean see the little guys in the suitcase in person lol..
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Warner Home Video has announced ""The Departed"" on home video which stars Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, and Jack Nicholson. The Martin Scorsese directed film will be available to own in single & double-disc editions from 2/13/2007.<br /><br />Each will include a 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, and English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track. The only extra on the single-disc will be the theatrical trailer. The two-disc special edition will include that, along with nine additional scenes with introductions by Martin Scorsese, a Story of the Boston Mob featurette, and a Creating Criminal Cultures featurette."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	We watched this film one evening almost 2 years ago and have not eaten meat  - chicken, pork, and beef - since! It made me so ashamed to be one of the human beings sent here to watch over God's creatures and end up treating them so horribly, that I quit buying/eating meat immediately! I refuse to support this system which devalues animal life so blatantly - just for profit and spite! Nuts!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"There are two main criticisms of the HBO miniseries based on David McCullough's biography of John Adams, and I don't understand either of them. The first is that the miniseries makes Adams less admirable than he was in the book. Frankly, that was my main criticism of the book--that McCullough tended to gloss over Adams' well-documented character flaws. To my mind the miniseries presents Adams pretty much as he must have been--vain, petty, quarrelsome, yet also strong, brilliant, courageous, and incorruptible. I find I love the man all the more for his flaws, because he overcame them so wonderfully to become a truly great man.<br /><br />The second criticism is that Paul Giamatti is unconvincing as Adams--a slam that to me is totally unfounded. Who did they want as Adams--Harrison Ford? I think Giamatti was the perfect actor to play Adams, and his performance is as wonderful as I expected it to be. Laura Linney is equally superb as Abigail Adams--if both she and Giamatti don't take home Emmys this year, it will be a screaming injustice--and the entire cast is first-rate, including Stephen Dillane as Thomas Jefferson, David Morse as George Washington, Tom Wilkinson as Benjamin Franklin, and Sarah Polley, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Kevin Trainor and Samuel Barnett as the Adams' children.<br /><br />Everything about this miniseries seems absolutely right; this is the first drama I've seen about the American Revolution that to my mind captures the look and feel of 18th-century America. And I still can't get the soaring, touching theme music out of my head (two composers, Rob Lane and Joseph Vitarelli, are credited with the music). ""John Adams"" is an enthralling miniseries, one of the best in the history of the medium."
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"Maybe I'm getting too lenient or forgiving in my old age, but I thought ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was a pretty good time.  Some famous movie figure (I forget who) defined a good movie as one that had three good scenes and no bad ones.  Well, this movie has at least four or five good scenes (sequences, actually), and nothing bad.<br /><br />And the characters and their interactions actually move beyond just being fun and into genuinely memorable territory a time or two, as well.  A favorite moment was when Jim Broadbent's college dean character comments to Indy, during a conversation about the recent losses of Indy's dad and their friend Marcus, that everyone eventually reaches a point where ""life stops giving you things and starts taking them away.""  That's a sad, resonant line worthy of Hollywood's serious fall dramas.<br /><br />But, yes, this is an action movie primarily, and the action is very good... and it's aided by the most lavish, polished effects of the series.  Likewise the villains, the sense of mystery, Indy's cocky yet ""am I sure I know what I'm doing?"" attitude with the characters around him, all of it works.<br /><br />Somewhat annoyingly, Paramount, Lucasfilm or whoever is making fans choose between a bare-bones DVD of the film or a two-disc set with all kinds of special features.  I found the latter a bit pricey, so I bought the single-disc version.  However, even here I was able to enjoy a nice little mini-doc (about 17 minutes) about how the new film came to be and a short pre-production piece (about 9 minutes) about the actors' preparations prior to filming.  And that was actually perfect for me, as I enjoy special features on a DVD, but don't like when it gets to be a ""tail wagging the dog"" situation... you know, where a two-hour movie is accompanied by seven or eight hours of special features.  Maybe in some cases that's good (if the film is a timeless classic or if you're just a huge, huge fan of a certain movie), but mostly I think the film itself should be the centerpiece of its DVD version.<br /><br />Anyway, ignore the nitpickers and pick up this new Indiana Jones adventure (in whatever version suits you).  I can't imagine anyone who enjoyed the other movies in this series not liking this one, too, at least a little."
B008M4HANQ	4.0	b	"My wife probably liked the movie more than I did but I am not really an avid movie watcher. It was nice to have the movie available as a streaming through the Amazon service because, while more expensive than retail rentals, it's on demand and convenient. I found the movie to be quite a switch from the old cartoon versions but I'm sure that it was supposed to be. It was kinda dark and eerie. The acting was VERY good. I don't know that I would nominate ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" for any kind of awards as best movie of the year but I sat through it and I give it a good solid 4-star review for the acting, plot and special effects. With that said, however, it's definitely not a kid's movie."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Jeff and all his friends are awsome in this video.  As always Walter and Peanut steal the show.  Must see if you like Jeff Dunham.
B001KEGR8Y	1.0	b	Jeff Dunham relies on stereotypes as a source for his humor. He might be a skilled ventriloquist but he is not funny. If you like carlos mencia or colin quinn you'd probably like this crap, but most of us laugh at xenophobes like archie bunker not with them. If you think this is funny, you are the joke.
B001684L0A	1.0	b	"Just got the box in the mail the other day.<br />Besides being incredibly hard to get out of the plastic with out breaking the discs, put the disc in the drive and player says - ""no disc"".<br />I bought the kind for US and Canada Region 1.<br />Is it a bad disc?.<br />I got it to work later on the computer and on another DVD player.<br />I would give the movie a better rating but, they need to smarter at presentation.<br />This begins with making disc holders that won't break the movie and readable by any DVD player common in the market.<br />If their goal wasn't so MONEY orientated, maybe they could get better ratings.<br />I've been buying less and less movies because most are just regenerations of old themes, however this one is worth revisiting. The other reason beng the lack of consumer needs, all the money has been invested in high tech images and little to no thought in packaging and presentation. I don't have time to watch the whole thing at once and really hate watching over and over again the begining credits that you can not fast forward through. They lack the insight into time that is valuable to a consumer. Skip the overdrawN intro's and comercials, I paid money to see a movie NOT ADS!"
B0098VYCCE	1.0	b	Is one of the worst movies I have seen. I would not recommend it. I suppose some people had to like it but I am not one of them.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I bought the first season based simply on magazine reviews of the series... It DEFINITELY lives up to the hype.  Although it has a bit more soft porn in a couple of episodes than I was expecting, I enjoyed the series.  It is absolutely not something I would buy for anyone younger than 18, or easily offended.  Since I am neither of those things, I found the character development and the story line mesmerizing.  My sister and I spent some cold winter nights watching 2-3 hours of episodes at a time.  I even have the second season reserved to buy.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	It's always a thrill to see a movie get the DVD treatment it deserves, and Frank Miller's Sin City: Recut - Extended - Unrated is a really fantastic package loaded to the gills with all kinds of good stuff.  If you're a Sin City fan, you'll want to just take a day off and indulge yourself in this ultimate Sin City experience - and it will take you the better part of a day to watch and go through everything this little box holds.  Even if you bought the regular DVD when it came out, I really think you'll want to upgrade to this special edition.<br /><br />I was unfamiliar with Frank Miller and his series of Sin City graphic novels.  When I first saw trailers for the film, all I knew was that Jessica Alba was in it, and that was reason enough for me to want to see it.  When you don't know Miller's work, the trailers for the film are hard to get your head around.  You're intrigued by the unique look of the film, with all the dark, gritty backgrounds and the selective use of color in certain scenes, but it isn't easy to figure out what the film is about, exactly.  When you do sit down and watch the film, you're just blown away: the whole look of the film is absolutely mesmerizing, unlike anything you've seen before; the cast is just full of one huge star after another turning in dazzling performances; the stories are dark and haunted and just draw you right in; but it's the characters most of all that captivate you.<br /><br />The film is really four stories assembled into one finished product.  The Customer is Always Right is a short introduction for what is to come - and then Marv takes over.  Marv is one of the most fascinating characters to come along in years.  He's a huge, ugly guy, a thug and killer you can't help but like and respect - and Mickey Rourke is simply amazing in the role.  Marv has the night of his life with a gorgeous woman named Goldie (Jaime King), then wakes up to find her dead.  Framed for the crime, Marv swears to find Goldie's killer, and he lets nothing stand in his way.  Even if it means dying, he's not going to back out - just because Goldie was nice to him.  There's plenty of violent action in this story, and Elijah Wood is surprisingly good as Kevin, an almost superhuman killer who eats his victims.  Then we're off to The Big Fat Kill, where Clive Owen and Benecio Del Toro steal the show, along with Devon Aoki as the beautifully lethal Miho.  She dishes out a lot of graphic violence, including a most excellent beheading.  Alexis Bledel lights up the screen with eyes you could dive right in to.  There's a fair bit of dark comedy in this one, including one incredibly funny bit you won't want to miss.  Finally, there's the story of Hardigan and little Nancy Callahan, a girl that good cop Hardigan saved from a brutal rapist/murderer before having the tables turned completely over on him.  Skinny little Nancy grew up strong and drop-dead gorgeous (like I said, I would buy the movie just for Jessica Alba), but she's still in danger - and only Hardigan can save her from That Yellow Bastard (basically a yellow Ferengi thanks to the damage Hardigan did to him eight years earlier -it's not easy regrowing a set of family jewels, you know - those side effects are brutal).  Bruce Willis is masterful as the tough and gritty yet sensitive Hardigan.<br /><br />It's impossible to truly describe these stories - you just have to see them for yourself.  The performances are so darn good that this movie actually gets better every time you watch it - and this special edition DVD gives you plenty of chances to do just that.  Along with the original theatrical release, you get the uncut version of the movie, split up into four separate, independent chapters; there's some 23 minutes of extra footage - including a couple of scenes that really help embellish the storylines.  You get two commentaries (one with co-directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, the other with Rodriguez, Quentin Tarentino, and Bruce Willis).  My favorite version features a recording of the Austin premier audience reaction; the depth of the dark comedy in these stories didn't really hit me full force until I was able to join in with that live audience atmosphere.  As if all that isn't enough, though, you also get a series of great featurettes.  Herein is where you truly learn to appreciate the film.  The vast majority of the actual filming was done in front of a green screen, and many of the actors who performed in the same scenes never even met.  And it was all filmed very quickly - all those great backdrops and that unique atmosphere made with CGI.  It's incredible to see just how this movie was shot and put together.<br /><br />There's nothing else out there remotely like Sin City.  It truly makes Frank Miller's comic come to life - for the most part, the movie mirrors the graphic novels themselves almost frame by frame.  Director Robert Rodriguez calls this an anti-movie; in a sense, Miller actually drew his comics in such a way that they could never be filmed.  Rather than adapt the graphic novels to film, Rodriguez went the other way - he adapted the film format to the graphic novels.  When you look at the movie in comparison to the books (and you get a copy of The Hard Goodbye with this DVD package), you'll see exactly what he means.  Sin City is truly an unparalleled, 100% complete success.  I just can't get enough of it.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	"We all know what to expect when we watch a film on the food supply: stomach churning, grainy film of horrendous slaughter house carnage that keeps you awake nights. I couldn't let the family see that, so I watched alone, and was pleasantly surprised. Most of the usual blood and guts (not a euphemism) had been edited out, and there are only a few unpleasant segments that are a minute or so long, and are well telegraphed so that you can avert your eyes. It is a shame that the producers could not have taken a leaf from the Pollan documentary <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012680D0"">King Corn (Green Packaging)</a>""King Corn""  which is entertaining, has a whimsical story, and informs as well, all without the blood, etc.<br /><br />I watched this for the information, and it was stunning, as well as informative. Well presented, and not overly frightening. Nice extras as well...give it a try!"
B0006989TE	4.0	b	Every time someone reviews an M. Night Shyamalan movie they seem to spend all of their time talking about the twist ending. I feel like they might be missing the point.<br /><br />Shyamalan's movies are all built on the tension between creepy supernatural goings-on and an almost excruciating everyday realism. The thing about the realism is that he bothers to do the legwork. He builds the world from the ground up every time, spending the first half of the movie lingering on glasses of water and shoes. And I'm not saying he's Wong Kar-Wai or anything, but he does this very well. So you spend an hour sitting there watching this, knowing that something isn't quite right. Even Unbreakable - which, for reasons I've never been able to properly articulate, I hated - pulled this off.<br /><br />Some people find this slow 'n' boring, but I enjoy it. I don't go in expecting to be BLOWN AWAY by a TWIST, even though I know there's going to be one. I just enjoy watching this fully-rendered world, there on the screen waiting to get twisted. There's a difference.<br /><br />Shyamalan isn't one of my favorite directors, by any means, but he's a guy doing his thing, and his thing isn't quite like anyone else's thing, and he does it well. The world, and Hollywood in particular, could use more of that.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	"This time when I went with my best friends to see a movie, my friend Karen was so totally NOT the only one who didn't understand the movie. For some reason a group of people have built themselves a village in the middle of a wildlife preserve, where they all live pretty much like people back around the time of the first Thanksgiving. But it is so clearly in the time of the modern world. For we DO see towns with present day cars, and a wildlife officer patrols the preserve in a modern Jeep or similar vehicle. The people of the village fear some sort of attacks from some fierce creatures that inhabit the woods around them. Are these attackers beasts of the wildlife preserve? Who knows? Or are they some fierce humans? No theory totally makes sense. The villagers do some vague talk about ""the ones we don't speak of"". But they so totally use that phrase often to speak of the ones they ""don't speak of""! Do these fierce attackers really exist? You can so totally sit through the whole movie eerily wondering that but so totally never get any answers! Anyhow, there does come a time when the village's idyllic way of life is indeed disrupted in a totally bloody way. But it isn't by any fierce and mysterious outside invaders. It is when one member of the village just up and stabs another almost to death for totally no reason. The victim is badly wounded, and they decide that his only hope for recovery is getting medicine from ""the towns"" that they so vaguely speak of. At least they don't call then ""the towns we don't speak of"". And if you thought this movie couldn't get any more weird, that is just when it gets so totally weirder! Who do they decide must travel to ""the towns"" to get medicines? Well, they send the fiancee of the stabbed man. At least she is one who cares about him very much. But guess what? She's blind! Yes, And THAT's whom they decide they must send ALONE through the supposedly monster-infested woods to ""the towns"" to get medicines. So she embarks on the mission, seeming to so totally have no chance of success. At one point as she seems to wander aimlessly through these woods where no other villagers dare to tread, the ground before her, as if it were glacial ice, opens up into a deep crevasse. And she so totally falls straight into the crevasse. But as if miraculously, she manages to climb out. Braving these and other dangers, she DOES get the medicine and returns to the village. How does she do it? Who knows? It is one of the so many unsolved mysteries of this movie. Like my friend Karen, this movie's heroine must have a fifth sense. That's all I can say. So she returns and there's a happy ending? Right? Who knows? This movie is just so totally unpredictable, but NOT in a good way! Just as she gets back to her fiancee, the movie abruptly ends, leaving everything as mysterious as ever. Now I'm afraid my friend Karen will think we're just being mean to not explain this movie to her. But we're her friends. We work hard at keeping her from putting her foot in her mouth (or her fist either). We protect her from lots of things and TRY to explain everything she doesn't understand? Why should anyone call us mean?"
B001684L0A	5.0	b	If history bores you, this movie isn't for you. If the founding of the government of the USA is boring, this movie isn't for you. I am a history buff and a Revolutionary War re-enactor and this is, by far, one of the best acted and realistic portrayals I've encountered. Being very familiar with the time period and the founding of the nation, I can sit there and point out the nitpicky details of the scenery that are in error, but the series was not directed with armchair history geniuses in mind. This is for a much broader audience. The performances are fantastic! John Adams was a man of great integrity...qualities that are RARE these days. He was very honorable and had many faults. But, he was sure right about France :0) and he stuck to his convictions. The movie has done justice to the excellent book written by McCullough. One of the funniest reviews I ever read is by a person who reviewed the John Adams book. He/she said it was extremely boring because it was a history book! Duh!
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This movie is a great way to help with any relationship. And i will be getting the book that they referr to in the movie.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	A great delux set of the soon to be classic film series.  The two disk sets included both of the theatrical and DVD versions of the film.  The bonus' are a ton of fun.  A must for a fan of the novels or of the film!

B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I think they did an excellent job in this one - creating the background and characters in a reasonable and understandable way, plus some great actions shots. I was impressed.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"I first saw this film in the theatres and wasn;t sure how to take it.  I remained unsure until I saw it for the second time.  Now I'm ready to let you know that I love this movie.  I think it's the kind of film that demands more then one viewing but after you know what it's all about and all the hype has disappeared, you can sit back and enjoy the characters, the performances and the interaction.  M Night takes his time with everything he does.  He's in no hurry to get you where he wants to get you.  Especially in the case of a ""period"" piece like he has here.<br /><br />I believe this movie is more about the futility of trying to control human behavior then anything else.  The ""monsters"" that are there (but not there) are in all of us through the emotions we display on a daily basis.  Using fear to maintain control has never been a good idea and the ""elders'  seem to have forgotten that it was their fear that created this mess in the first place.<br /><br />William Hurt's speech about love equals the speech that Mal gives at the end of ""Serenity"".<br /><br />see it again (three times if you must).<br /><br />when you're not waiting to see what will happen next, you can sit back and enjoy the show."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	We are going to end up buying another one because our son has wacthed this one so much it is getting abused!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Loved the John Adams miniseries.  So much interesting history.  Good refresher for the Independence Day celebration.  Dragged a little in a few places, but overall was very good.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	I love the move but I have a big screen TV and the picture doesnt' cover the hole screen. This is a great move it needs to be seen on the entire  screen. THANK YOU
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	"""Sin City"", Robert Rodriguez's ""translation"" of Frank Miller's classic graphic novel series, is not a film for everyone. It's the type of film you either love or hate, no in between.<br /><br />""Sin City"" is, in more ways than one, like ""Pulp Fiction"". Both films have oodles of violence, a large ensemble cast (even ""PF'S own Bruce Willis has a role), and even Quentin Tarrentino himself directs a sequence. ""Sin City"" also uses ""Pulp Fiction's"" method of combining several different stories into one movie.<br /><br />The first story deals with grizzled veteran cop detective Hartigan (Willis), who is searching for little Nancy Callahan, an 11 year old girl who has been kidnapped by the sadistic son (Nick Stahl) of a corrupt senator (Powers Boothe). Hartigan manages to save little Nancy, but when his partner Bob (Michael Madsen) seemingly turns the table, it looks as if Hartigan is done for.<br /><br />The next story focuses on Marv (Mickey Rourke). Marv is a hardened ex con trying to go straight with the help of his parole officer Lucille (Carla Cugino). One night, he meets Goldie (Jaime King). Marv sees in Goldie the woman he always wanted, one who loves and understands him. However, that night, Goldie is murdered in Marv's bed. This was done naturally to frame Marv. Determined to clear his name, Marv is led through a wild maze to find who killed Goldie, seeking the help of her twin sister Wendy (King). He is led to Kevin (Elijah Wood in a role that will make you forget that this is the same guy who played Frodo), a sadistic cannibal who preys on prostitutes. He manages to defeat Kevin, but in order to protect the ones he loves, Marv is forced to turn himself in and give up his life.<br /><br />The next story deals with Dwight (Clive Owen), who has recently hooked up with hyperactive barmaid Shellie (Brittany Murphy). When Shellie's ex boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) pays a little visit and roughs Shellie up, Dwight seeks revenge. He is led to Oldtown, where he runs into Gail (Rosario Dawson), an old flame and leader of a brigade of prostitutes. A shootout between the cops, Jackie Boy and his gang means a war between the cops and the mob in Oldtown. Determined to stop it before it happens, Dwight drives the bodies out to an abandoned tar pit. However, before he gets there, local crime boss Manute (Michael Clarke Duncan) gets wind of this, and sends his men out to kill him. He is rescued by Miho (Devon Aoki), a prostitute who is also an amazing fighter. This concludes in a bloody shootout between the mob and the prostitutes, and makes for a truly exciting sequence.<br /><br />The fourth and final sequence ties in with the first chapter. Eight years after rescuing little Nancy (here played by Jessica Alba), Hartigan, who still keeps in touch of her, has decided to start his life over. But he soon learns that Roark's son, whom he thought he killed, has resurfaced, and is out to finish the job. He catches up with Nancy and is intent on saving her. This leads to a bang up finale between Willis and Stahl, and results in a chilling ending that will stay with you forever.<br /><br />To put in simple terms, ""Sin City"" is an excellent movie. It is one of the greatest comic book films ever created, and both the storyline and special effects work extremely well. This two disc special edition is loaded with bonus features and is a dvd that belongs in your collection."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I found this to be entertaining. It is a little violent at times, so I wouldn't recommend it to children, even though they have marketed it to them with a Zillion Toys! I liked it better than Fantastic 4 part 2, and Spiderman 2 and 3.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Absolutely AWESOME!  The best stand up comedian of this time.  Buy this video, you won't be disappointed.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Thanks for such fast service; came in good packaging too.  This should be mandatory viewing for everyone in our country.  It will change the way you think about our food chain and McDonalds.  I now think how sad it is that our future children are getting dooped into eating such poor products (that has changed everything down the line for big profits) with enticing toys they beg their parents to buy them.  I told one individual about it and the reply was that what we don't know won't hurt us and I said, this time you're wrong, it will affect you in adverse ways eventually.  Your body reflects what you eat on a daily basis so I will buy organic as much as possible now and when I do eat out, I will be asking a lot more questions along the way.  You will too once you see this important documentary.  Run, don't walk to get it either!
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I am over 50 and I couldn't leave my seat if it weren't for the pause button. Looking forward to seeing part-2
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	One of the best movies the summer of 08 gave us! Robert Downey Jr. has made an amazing come back to films. Jon Favreau has brought the armored avanger to life! The sequel will hopefully be just as amazing!
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"It's really nice to see a movie produced in a new way. I'm so glad director Robert Rodriguez didn't put comic book frames in this.<br /><br /> (See, you can learn something from watching that awful ""The Incredible Hulk"" movie.) I can't think a movie to compare this too, which is a good sign<br /><br />(...)"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Pixar has delivered a winner worthy of the checkered flag in 'CARS'.  This film marks the return of Pixar to what they do best:  a story about a character who learns what is really important in life (ie Toy Story 1 & 2, Monsters Inc. & Finding Nemo).<br /><br />Coupled with the jaw-dropping, eye-popping, high quality CGI we've come to expect from the studio, Pixar adds a great soundtrack guarranteed to have the audience on their feet cheering Lightning on to victory.<br /><br />'CARS' truly has something for everyone:  the kids will love the fast paced race scenes and 'Mater's jokes;  NASCAR fans will appreciate the voices and the attention to the details of racing in the film.  The homage to lost Americana and 'the Mother Road', Route 66 is just icing on the cake, it makes a great thing even better.<br /><br />'CARS' is a worthy addition to the home DVD collection and I recommend it without reservation.  Enjoy!!
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Harrison Fords does an outstanding job in this fourth (final?) episode of the series. This is a captivating film from start to finish. It won this viewer immediately with the breath-taking cinematography of the Nevada desert landscape. Also highly appealing were the teenagers driving down a lonely Nevada road, with the radio on full blast playing an Elvis tune. They challenged the lead car of an Army convoy to a race, little did anyone realize what was soon to transpire. At the checkpoint, the convoy soldiers murder the guards. Russian soldiers and their leader infiltrated a secret storage facility hidden in the Nevada desert. There, Indiana Jones and a former British MI6 agent were prisoners, forced to locate a treasure they had discovered about 15 years ago ... It turns out, the Russian leader Dr. Irina Spalko (played exquisitely by Cate Blanchett) was a scientist who was involved in mind research and needed the Crystal Skull which was purported to have secret powers. I loved the ingenious technique by which Indy found the chest which contained a mummy from Peru with a disfigured skull. It verified something of great importance to the Russian scientist ...<br /><br />Next, Indy is interrogated by the CIA for his association with the British Agent who turns out to be a spy working for the Soviets. The CIA pressures Marshall College to fire Indy who instead is given a leave of absence based on a deal made by the President of the college with the Board. On leave, Dr. Henry Jones Jr (Indiana Jones) plans to teach in the UK where he has connections. On his way out of town, he is tracked down by a rebellious teenager named Mutt who has a personal letter from someone very well known to Indy, a UK archeaolgist who disappeared on an excavation in Peru. I loved the fight scene in the cafe which was deviously initiated by Mutt to allude the Soviet Agents. Mutt needs Indy's help to locate the missing professor and Mutt's mother, both of whom disappeared while on search of the Crystal Skull ...<br /><br />Indiana Jones and Mutt fly to Peru where they dig through the tombs of Spanish Conquistadors to locate clues. The Soviet soldiers and Dr. Irina Spalko are hot on their tails. Naturally, Indy and Mutt free the professor and Mutt's mother from their captors. The jungle chase scenes and the Amazon River escape with the two falls, were particularly enjoyable. High accolades and loud praise to Steven Spielberg and George Lucas who outdid themselves with a spectacular ending. The special effects and cinematography associated with the temple at Akator were inspirational. The ending was dynamic and jaw-dropping. This entire sequel was filled with superb creativity and amazing craftsmanship ...Erika Borsos [pepper flower]
B006H90TLI	3.0	b	the first 1hr and 45 minutes of this movie is flawless 5-star cinematic greatness and perfection !!!!!<br />  the last 10-15 minutes is 2-3 star at the most. much has been written about the ending and how it doesn't wrap up all neatly and tidy. my biggest problem is when the josh brolin character is finally killed by the badim character. the killing is not seen on screen. it's almost like an afterthought or anti-climatic.<br />  the film is so moody slow and wonderfully methodical. brolin continues to stay one step ahead of badim and they each and both share 75 % of the movie. all of a sudden you see that brolin's character has been killed off screen. i find it so disjointed that even when there's a shot of dead brolin's character on the floor i - questioned whether it was really him. you know that brolin's character might well be killed. i wanted to see and experience it. that would have been consistent with the film.<br />  the film is a terrific cat chasing mouse story only they don't show the ultimate battle - just a dead mouse laying there. very, very, very anti-climatic to me and disappointing !!!<br />  the fact that the bad guy doesn't get his just due and continues to live on - didn't bother me really. oh sure, i tend to prefer neat hollywood endings but i'm open if it's done well.<br /><br />still, the movie won the oscar for best picture - so what do i really know ?<br /><br />  eric
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	"The movie Order of the Phoenix is exciting and well crafted. However, some essential parts, like the mystery element are completely lost and many key events can only be really understood if you read the book. As such, the movie is a great illustration for the book. Usually it is better to see the movie first then read the book- not so for this movie. Viewing it is like meeting old friends, ""aha! Here's this event"" ""There's this character"", etc.  If you already know what's going on, it's great to see it and what is not shown or discussed doesn't matter because you know it from the book. All the actor performances are excellent and the design is great, not to mention the 3D effects at Imax which are exciting without being gaudy (kitschy). Still, as a stand-alone experience the movie lacks depth, which might explain some viewer's disappointment with it. Could it have been done better? Yes, but you can't expect a ""Peter Jackson/Fran Walsh/ Philippa Boyens"" treatment for every book. Then again, why should the movie have to stand alone? Read the book first.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/043935806X"">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Book 5)</a>"
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Good movie it took me a bit to get this movie but i finaly did and it was very entertaning!!!!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is an awesome CD. It is so funny and we thouroughly loved it. Hope Jeff Dunham puts out more!
B005ZMUQCK	3.0	b	"*Note - As many times, when the film is considered a ""kid's"" film, I watch my two children's reactions to the film.  10-yrs & 8-yrs...<br /><br />As I viewed Cars, I was stunned at how beautiful and amazing computer animation has become.  It has evolved from a novelty, to truly a beautiful form of art.  Cars, especially the scenery, was visually amazing...AMAZING!!!<br /><br />However...<br /><br />I noticed my children fidgeting throughout the film.  I could tell that they were losing interest rather quickly.  I did not see them laughing out loud with any frequency.  Unfortunately, they seemed more interested in the popcorn, rather than the film.  Afterwards I asked them how they liked the film and they just shrugged their shoulders.  There was never a moment that one could really feel sorry for Lightning McQueen or emphasize with him.  He was arrogant and self-serving as Chick Hicks was, although not as nasty...<br /><br />Cars failed in one major way that the other Pixar/Disney films succeeded in...Cars failed to have characters that my children (or my wife or I) cared about.  They were funny, but we did not feel emotionally invested in anyone.  Pixar, up until now, always had films that had great stories first and great graphics was a bonus.  This seemed that they put the graphics first and the story second.<br /><br />One other thing...if you are not a big racing fan, which my wife and two children are not, many of the jokes and cameos will go right over your head...thank goodness for Mater..."
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	"Like all of the other movies this one came so long after the book that I can't remember a lot of details but the adaptation seems as ""good"" as any to me. It is, after all, a darker toned story that still managed to get details right in spite of being heavily edited down from book form. ""Goblet of Fire"" seemed to have more color in it if my memory is right, this one is dark and depressing colorwise.<br /><br />The ""extras"" disc is pretty much a waste of time with Tonks tour of the studio being kind of silly, not telling a person much, the editing section was the usual stuff too.<br /><br />I'm waiting for the next movie now."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Makes you wonder what is in our food and what it has done to our bodies.  Could there be a link to the overwhelming numbers of unhealthy American chidren?  Autism, ADD and cancers?
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This movie was hilarious. Peanut and Walter were the best I think. It made me laugh until I was crying. I highly recommend that if you haven't seen this then you need to watch it. And if its not in any of your local stores I strongly recommend ordering it from Amazon. They are inexpensive and fast. So go out and get your copy today.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I/m usually the last person in a room and the last one to leave, so this review on season one of this HBO show may be sooo yesterday considering season two is almost done and the box DVD set is probably in its infancy (but soon to be released most likely for the summer).<br />First of all, Charlaine Harris? Never read any of her books. The market being flooded with tomes about the undead (Rice, Hamilton, etc., etc.), I just couldn/t chisel away enough time to catch up of on one of hers (although I did recently acquire the first three novels in a handy three-in-one anthology from Science Fiction Book Club!)<br />Alas my review will be brief (since many have already seen the series and raved and another rave would just be another drop in the bucket). Praise goes to Alan Ball (the brainchild of another HBO original Six Feet Under) for his take on the south and having the vision to lay on the goth and supernatural extra thick in order to enthrall us with a world resembling ours with all its wonders and imperfections while at the same time never letting us forget that not all monsters have fangs and drink the blood of the living.<br />By now its no mystery the two leads- Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer- off set are an item. Which probably explains why the screen pops every time those two fill it. Talk about chemistry! Ana/s mind-reading Sookie Stackhouse is tender and painfully vulnerable while Moyer/s Bill Compton provides the dark, brooding undead (who also happens to the only person whose thoughts Sookie can/t read!). With the support of a strong ensemble cast- Tara Thronton (Sookie/s fiery best friend), Sam Trammell (the shape-shifting bar-owner), Ryan Quanten (Sookie/s philandering older brother), Nelsan Ellis (as the hilarious short-order cook), and a host of others, the show draws you into their outrageous lives with all the ease of a child to a sugary treat.<br />Kudos of course goes to Louisiana for the setting of fictional Bon Temps and its atmosphere rife with seduction and plain ordinary charm. It provides the backdrop for which the stage of this explosive original is set.<br />In conclusion, only HBO (with the exception of perhaps Showtime) could bring this very adult, hot-blodded, sexy, violent, compelling drama to the small screen (depending what size HD surround sound TV ya/ll may have!). I myself have no cable so I had to wait for the DVD box set (and will most likely wait for the next one as well). Ladies and gentlemen: this is what TV entertainment is all about. Enjoy your True Blood! It/s on the house.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I really enjoyed this movie. Charlize Theron is a great actress and plays this role wonderfully. The huntsman and dwarfs really brought the characters to life and the effects were great.
B007FQDPL8	2.0	b	I have read the whole series of books and couldn't wait til the marathon of the whole first season on HBO this week. After watching the first 3 shows, I wish I had never taped it to watch in the first place. When I saw it was directed by Alan Ball I knew there would be sex in every scene (he directed most of the Six Feet Under episodes, so I expected it). I saw more sex in the first 3 episodes of this show than I remember reading about in the whole 8 books I read! To me the show is nothing like the books and even though the show isn't bad, the books are much better. I don't think I will watch the rest of the episodes because if I do I will never be able to read the books again. The books are much more humorous than the show, cleaner and not sleazy like the show. I couldn't wait for the next book of the series to come out because there was a lot of suspense, but the show...well, I just know it will be more weird sex scenes and not much suspense. I think you will either like the books or the show but not both.
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"I anticipated the release of the latest in the Indiana Jones series with great expectations.  Unfortunately, I felt that those expectations were only partly met.<br />  I didn't expect that this fourth installment would be able to top number three; after all Sean Connary and Harrison Ford in the same movie is a pretty tough act to follow.  However, I didn't expect a movie that couldn't even equal the quality of the second.<br />  Just as with ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"", I felt that parts of the overall storyline had been skipped or skimped on to the point of hurting the flow of the movie.  Too often, the makers of movies get trapped in the prescribed formulaic methods they are told are required for audience enjoyment.  In doing so, the skips and skimps become overused.<br />  I am convinced that is what weakened this latest movie.  Trying to fit an elaborate story into a specific time frame isn't a necessity!  Adding a few minutes to each key scene to help flesh out the storyline can make it a vastly improved work.  The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy proved that audience members can take it!<br />  On a brighter note, I think these movies are still on the upper half of the ratings scale I use to judge the quality of my movies.  On a scale of 1 (meaning STINK-O, RUN AWAY!) and 10 (meaning WATCH FIVE TIMES IN A ROW WITHOUT MOVING) I'd give ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" a 6.  Definately worth watching once, but not worth purchasing unless you are a collector.<br />  Thanks for reading!"
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I am totally happy with this DVD workout. It arrived on time and in good condition. The workout is hard, believe me. You really have to dig deeper and push yourself. I am at day 17 and i don't think i look any different but i feel myself getting stronger and i can keep up better with the program. Good buy if you want to challenge yourself.
B001IA2PTK	2.0	b	This got two stars only becaues it is Indy, one of the all time greatest heroes.  But damnation those CGI monkeys and that entire scene completely ruined the entire movie! WHY would he use such cheesy special effects and such a cheesy child like scene! IT RUINED THE MOVIE!
B004JMSIRC	3.0	b	Given all the praise and excitement surrounding The Dark Knight, the superhero movie Iron Man released just a few weeks earlier was somewhat overshadowed. However, reviews of Iron Man were almost universally positive at the time, so I was looking forward to sitting down and enjoying the movie.<br /><br />The resurgent Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark, a hyper-rich genius engineer and unstoppable womaniser who builds extremely lethal weapons for the US military. His latest invention is a massive multi-warhead variation on the 'bunker-buster' missile, one that is meant to level entire Afghan mountain ranges. Stark is kidnapped by stereotypical Afghan terrorists during a demonstration of his new weapon and forced to build them some newer and more lethal versions of the same weapon. Stark is aided in his work by a gentle local educated Afghan man who is brought in as a translator but in the space of about ten minutes has convinced Stark that making massive destructive weapons isn't good for his soul and he needs to change. Stark, despite being under constant 24-hour video surveillance, is able to build a massive robot suit armed with flamethrowers and a jetpack instead of the promised missile, and is able to effect an escape, although sadly not to the theme tune from The A-Team.<br /><br />Having checked that I hadn't made an error and picked up a copy of a comedy movie by accident, I continued watching in mounting disbelief as Stark returns to the USA as a new, more moral man, deeply changed by his horrifying experiences in the Afghan mountains. The newer, more caring Stark decides to build a more uber version of his metal suit so he can personally go off and slaughter the terrorists with rocket launchers and flamethrowers. Of course, hijinks ensue and the story ends in a series of massive explosions. Who would have thought?<br /><br />Iron Man is a deeply stupid movie with plot holes and logical flaws so vast they render the story almost nonsensical in places. However, the movie remains brainlessly entertaining thanks to the almost single-handed efforts of Robert Downey Jr., who was clearly enjoying himself far too much making this hokum. His portrayal of Stark works excellently, despite the highly dubious writing, and I suspect his best moments were all ad-libbed. Suffice to say, without its star working above and beyond the call of duty, this movie would be a total failure. Gwyneth Paltrow stands around being, well, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges manfully deals with a curious baldness-beard combination. There's also a lot of guff about a new energy source Stark spontaneously created in his Afghan cave that dozens of the finest scientists in the world cannot replicate in their state-of-the-art labs, but none of it really matters.<br /><br />Iron Man (***) is quite possibly the most sloppily-written film I've seen since Pearl Harbour, but it's also a lot of fun, as long as you strictly remember to put your brain in neutral before watching it.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"I didn't expect much since I knew it was low-budgeted film but this movie really moved my heart. I sincerely learned a lot by watching and it helped me to realize a lot of things about myself as well. I encourage everyone who is married or unmarried to watch it. Maybe the acting isn't top hollywood notch but I guarantee that the content and the point of the movie is very heart-wrenching. This movie is no near trying to preach or trying to ""convert"" people to Christianity. However, this movie does display the TRUTH...the struggles of men and the insides of our hearts. Anyone who is/are struggling in their marriage or relationships should watch it because I believe that this movie speaks a loud & clear message for itself...that a Marriage is a covenant of a life time. A wonderful and great movie! I can not stress this enough. There is not one thing I would change about this movie. Some might find that the acting might be ""not good"" but it has a bit of everything...humor, drama, thrill and the truth. I loved it. Well thought out movie."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"Martin Scorsese has done many incredible things and its doubtful that this will be remembered as his masterpiece, but had anyone else directed it, the Departed would be heralded as a jewel.<br /><br />Nicholson, DiCaprio, Damon, Wahlberg, Baldwin and Sheen are all extraordinary and stretching themselves, but it's Vera Farmiga who steals the show. Maybe it's testimony to something about DiCaprio's ability to truly share the screen, but Farmiga is just as exceptional in this film as Cate Blanchet was in the Aviator. Furthermore, Farmiga is every bit the equal of Pfeiffer in her similar role inTequila Sunrise.<br /><br />Long the best part of shows like ""Touching Evil"" and ""UC: Undercover,"" Vera Farmiga brings a vulnerable honesty to her role, even as she plays against some of Hollywood's heaviest hitters.<br /><br />That said, the plot gives the audience an interesting twist on the roles of the police and criminals as each side shows its factionalism and parallels.<br /><br />It's less a tale of good and evil, than one of revelation, distrust and continuous compromise.<br /><br />It may not be Scorsese's best, but let's face it doesn't have to be to be an exceptional film by any standard."
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	EXCELLENT MOVIE.  SENT AS A GIFT, BUT RECIPIENT HAS NOT YET<br />WATCHED IT.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham is incredibly talented.  His characters are personable and subjects are common everyday things that everyone goes through.  Everyone can relate (with a big laugh).  We've watched this over and over and still can't help but laugh all the way through it each time.  It's hillarious.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	I have followed the Hogwarts saga since its beginning and was instantly enchanted by it.  The thread that J.K. sews through from beginning to end is fascinating and I keep going back to watch and pick up the clues.<br />Truly a masterpiece of storytelling and visually supportive.
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	Harry Potter movie 7 is one intense movie in the sense of dark magical ways. However the scenes were draggy, the conclusion for the movie will blow your mind :P
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was fantastic we have watched it about 3 times already and thinking about watching it this coming weekend again, the special effects are great and you just want it to keep going.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	This DVD rounds out my collection of the series. It was somewhat dark compaired to some earlier movies but enjoyable, nevertheless
B001684L0A	5.0	b	The John Adams miniseries was the best made for TV production I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the founders. It brought them to life as people we can relate to and appreciate the sacrifices they made. In the end, they were real people, real Americans.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I wish I had seen this when I was taking American History in high school.  Wow!  History comes alive with this series.  It is impossible to watch without appreciating the price that was paid for our freedom.  Huge sacrifices were made on so many fronts and it is humbling to be reminded.  We used this series to enhance our homeschool curriculum this year.  A wonderful addition to any home movie library!!  Order this --- it is AWESOME!
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	I love good sci fi movies especially scary ones with good effects, but the movie has to have some basis in reality.  This movie doesn't.  The movie begins with the arrival to the planet in question and it appears that the crew on board have never met one other and have no training in exploration of a planet or the handling of a ship. Everything is done on a spur of the moment without anyone being in charge or using common sense.  There is no delegation of authority or planning.  Then we have the evil robot who acts on his own without listening or answering to the people in charge along with the corporate stooge who couldn't care less about the people on board?  When someone is infected she stands at the spacecraft door with a torch rifle to prevent them from coming in? Very funny. What was the director thinking? If you are going to make a sci fi movie then make it realistic.  These people are accidents waiting to happen and happen they do.  I only hope when in the future we actually go to unexplored planets the people involved have more common sense than the ones that participated in this fiasco.
B009NQKPUW	3.0	b	This is amazon.com. We enter here to BUY PRODUCTS, and user reviews are supposed to review the product, which, in this case, is the bluray. Talk about the languages, the extras, the quality, but don't talk about THE MOVIE!!! 300 reviews and the bluray is in preorder state. Go to IMDB to review the movie and leave this useful for purchasers!!!
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	We thoroughly enjoyed these DVDs. I purchased the three pack for my daughter for Christmas. A comedian the whole family can watch.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"It's no secret that ""The Departed"" is a remake of the successful Hong Kong movie. I've watched it several months ago and was very impressed. After watching ""The Departed"", I realized that I wanted watch it again. It is a completely new movie, spiritually. The affiliation in the screenplay to the original one is unavoidable, but Martin Scorsese did a great job in substantiating the cop and criminal story with his own interpretation.<br /><br />This is probably different from other Martin Scorsese's movies but it's truly enjoyable. It takes a Scorsese to gather such a crowd of stars and herd them into a consistent and coherent film like this. Although movies like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" are classics, and very very well made films, ""The Departed"" is incredible from the amazing cast, interesting soundtrack, to the remarkable editing.<br /><br />The real standouts of the film are DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, and Jack Nicholson. Leonardo really does give one of the best performances of the year. He plays his character with an anxious fidgetiness and a bunch of controlled fear and anger. Matt Damon gives a criminally underrated performance. His character isn't entirely bad, but I feel that he does the deceptive things he does out of honor and devotion to his 'Dad'. Jack Nicholson is a constant threat in this film. His tenacity and unpredictability strikes fear in the hearts of everyone he comes in contact with. He demands respect and he gets it. His chemistry with Leo and Matt is top-notch. Mark Wahlberg plays an A-Hole in every form of the word. If he doesn't know you, he doesn't like you and doesn't get to know you and Wahlberg plays it with perfect arrogance. Vera Farmiga holds her own on the screen with DiCaprio and Damon, but she is easily forgotten. Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Ray Winstone add great veteran backup. Props to Marty.<br /><br />This is easily one of Scorsese's finest efforts and one of the best films of 2006. I can honestly say that Scorsese brilliantly makes ""The Departed"" look like an original and genuine chef-d'oeuvre, whom only he has the secret to. I highly recommended this movie as well as ""Infernal Affairs."""
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	"I watched a copy of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One"" and found it a perfectly acceptible looking copy. There were a number of scenes I would have liked to see from the book which would have helped move the story along just as well as<br />leaving them out. The film did not look as dark as some other reviewers have claimed. I watched it on a regular television with a standard DVD-VHS player. If you have not read the book you may find the film more than a little confusing, many<br />changes were made in the screenplay that were not needed to put the story across; the special effects are as good as ever and the soundtrack is just as good as all the others in the series. Will probably get a copy of the DVD to add to my Potter DVD collection to have the full set, but do not feel that this is the best of the<br />series of films. Cannot wait to see the eighth and last film. Though I suspect it will have many changes from the book too. One last comment I feel that the Dursleys and the actors that portray them got the short end of the stick in this film. After all they were with Harry in the beginning and should have had a little more screen time at the end than they did."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	This was a great movie, especially when compared with most movies of the 21st Century, but it was not an original concept.  I saw a very similar film years ago, whic was titled Internal Affairs.  The plot was almost identical.  I loved both movies, but I felt the acting was superior in this modern adaptation.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"This movie and the Love Dare Journal ""literally"" saved our marriage! We own it, we watch it regularly, we each own our own copies of the Love Dare Journal and do the dares, we have bought the Love Dare 365 day devotionals in leather covers for our anniversary! It's not only a marriage saver, but a life saver too!!"
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Both of my daughters really like this movie which thrills me because I am sick to death of princesses. Story moves along nicely and the racing scenes are fun.
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	This movie could have been done much better by Chris Columbus.  (The director of the first two movies).  The meaning and feelings in the book are stripped out of the movie and those who do not read the book are missing out on the magic of the series.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Everyone should see this DVD.  It is a real eye-opener to the food we eat.  We need to make informed choices
B0006989TE	2.0	b	You've read the other reviews, you know the story. Sort of old hat in the SF world, but that's okay. I have no problem with the story itself. Except. Why do the people talk as they did in the 19th century? And why, oh, why, do they wait something like thirty seconds between each word? Was this just to make the movie longer? And why were they wearing those ridiculous outfits out in the wilderness instead of modern clothing? And where did they get their clothing and other things? Tooooooo many very loose ends. But that oh so slow speaking; man, it had me gnashing my teeth.And the oh so slow action was just as aggravating. Somebody's dying, get them help! Don't set a date for a meeting to try and determine if you should go for help.  I had a hard time suspending disbelief in this film.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of M. Night. I think he makes beautiful films which tend to be gimmicky and will not stand the test of time. Which is too bad, since he is surely a wonderful talent. I hope he will see the light and turn his hand to something substantial and worthwhile.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	This is the best Harry Potter movie yet, and with such exceptional writing, acting, and special effects, it should be on Blu-Ray.  I'm of the mind that if a film doesn't meet this criteria, then it can just remain on DVD (for example, I only plan on purchasing the Blu-Ray versions of the Harry Potter movies from the third one on).  I was also lucky to get this for an amazing price shortly after it was released, which is great reason why people should buy what they want early on if at all possible.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	"This movie was just bad.  The dialog was campy and the ""suspense"" was just stupid.  M. Night Shyamalan needs to move on to a different type of movie (if he can) because the plot of The Village is so thin, it is clear that he has run out of ideas.  A real film maker could have taken this story so much further - The ""evolution"" of the creatures would have been a thousand times more interesting.  How did the village get built?  Why?  That would have made a really great film - instead, M. Night Shyamalan waste a super cast (how does he get these really good actors and actresses to act so poorly?)on a rip off of the Twilight Zone and the novel ""The Giver"".  He needs to get over this ""Written, Produced and Directed by M. Night Shyamalan"" business - Make a good film and get past the ego."
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	I thought this was really good.  I did not enjoy this show as well as the other ones.  I enjoyed more of the adventures of Harry and his friends, then the drama.  I wish there was going to be the rest of the books made into movies.<br />I hope you enjoy the show.  It is worth watching.
B008M4HANQ	2.0	b	Save yourself the money and watch any of the many movies that this one copied - all of them are better than this schlock. Kristen Stewart can't emote, much less act (is 20-something too young to overdose on botox?) Charlize Theron chewed so much scenery it's a wonder she has any teeth left, and Hemsworth sounded like he was trying to spit out his lines while holding a mouthful of nails. The dwarves were the only redeeming part and they were vastly underused.<br />And no, I'm not a Twilight fan so I'm not writing a negative review because I feel betrayed by Stewarts's stupidity, though it certainly explains why the director decided to use her. I want my money back!
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	This is a wonderful movie for young and old on the relationship of marriage.  If reminds people of what a great marriage should be. Heartwarming! Should be viewed by everyone!
B0006989TE	2.0	b	This wa a horror movie with no thrills. Since everyone already guessed that the monsters weren't real to begin with all we were left with to amuse ourselves were the characters and dialogue -- both of which were boring. And the plot just didn't make any sense in the end. If the elders could have easily gone and gotten the medicine -- why did they insist on sending the blind girl? What was the point of that? She was the least likely to make it to the towns and the most likely to blow their secret once she got there even if she did happen to run into a security guard. It just didn't make any logical sense.
B0006989TE	2.0	b	The trailers for The Village looked really good. I especially liked the one that showed clips of M. Night Shyamalan's past films. There was one problem that I had with the trailers. They introduced the film as M. Night Shyamalan's &quot;The Village.&quot; When the director's name appears above the title of the film in order to appeal to an audience, that, in itself, is scary.<br /><br /> The film opens in an amish-Puritan type of setting. We are quickly introduced to people known as the elders (including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Brendan Gleeson), the village idiot (Adrien Brody), and the calm guy Lucious (Joaquin Phoenix). We learn that there are creatures in the woods that surround the village and that the villagers are not allowed to enter those woods. We also learn that the creatures, who are attracted by the color red, will not disturb the village unless the village disturbs them. Guess what, Lucios disturbs them.<br /><br /> The creatures randomly enter the village and leaves signs of their existence like red slash marks on the doors, skinned animals, and sightings. This creeps out the people bad enough to make them hide in underground shelters.<br /><br /> Later on, Lucious is hurt and his love interest (Bryce Dallas Howard) has to leave the village to go to a town for medical supplies. While out, she is chased by a creature and has to be clever in order to escape it. She is able to reach the town and return with supplies.<br /><br /> Of course, with this being a Shyamalan film, you can expect to see a twist. There is a twist, although, by the end of the film, there really isn't much of one.<br /><br /> The actors do a good job. There just isn't much for them to work with. Like I said, I was really excited about the film because of the trailers. Also, as actors were being named to the project, it made me even more intrigued. Joaquin is back in his second Shyamalan film, and I really like him and don't think he gets enough credit for some of his roles. There was also the addition of Adrien Brody, who looks creepy anyway. I was hoping he would have a role like Samuel L. Jackson did in &quot;Unbreakable,&quot; but he didn't.<br /><br /> There are little bits of clues placed throughout the movie as to the ending. One person said that &quot;any person with half a brain could figure out the ending within the first 10 minutes of the film.&quot; Apparently, I don't have half a brain because I couldn't do it in 10 minutes, more like 45. I'm a little slow, perhaps.<br /><br /> This movie just did not grasp me. I wanted to like it, but I never could get in to it. Things would happen, and I would just be like &quot;eh.&quot; It just wasn't scary, frightening, suspenseful, or that interesting. I guess I should have known. I don't really like walking into the woods anyways.
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	"This is a good movie, but if you haven't read the book you might find it a bit confusing. As others have mentioned a LOT of stuff is left out. The prophecy, which is the most important thing in the whole book, isn't fully explained. There is a long list of missing things, but I won't go on about it.<br />The acting was pretty good. I'm not too picky about it, so I didn't have any problems there.<br /><br />If you have read the book, I would suggest treating the movies in general as something seperate and different. If you constantly try to compare the two, you will only be disappointed. This really is a good movie, even if it doesn't have all the magic of the book.<br />So, looking at the movie itself, the only thing I didn't like was how rushed it seemed. This is the shortest Potter movie yet. I think we all could have sat through an extra few minutes if it meant smoother transitions.<br /><br />One thing you need to know before you buy this is that it has NO extras. It is the movie, and that's it. There are no deleted scenes, no interviews with the cast, no commentary, no cheesey games, nothing of that nature. I really want to emphasize this point because when I bought this DVD, I knew there wouldn't be a lot of extras, but I thought I could count on something. I was pretty disappointed when I saw the menu: ""play movie"" ""scene selections"" ""language""<br />But now you can learn from my mistake. If you're looking for extras, try the 2-disk edition. However, if you don't care about that kind of stuff, this one is probably for you. Might as well save some money with it.<br /><br />To sum it up, this is a good movie - but nothing more."
B005ZMUQCK	1.0	b	"We normally love Pixar films.  For instance, thought The Incredibles was, well Incredible.  Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc and Toy Story 1&2 were great, so were excited when the new Pixar film came out.  We didn't catch it in the theater, so when Christmas came around, we asked for, and got it.<br /><br />A couple nights ago, there was nothing interesting on TV, so we decided to put in Cars.  We got about halfway through, after laughing a couple of times--tractor tipping--, but then turned it off.  I'm not a big NASCAR fan, but I thought, ""Hey, it's Pixar.  They can make anything fun.""<br /><br />I guess we should have checked it out of the library first, before deciding if we wanted to add it to our collection.  Now I think the library can add it to theirs.....<br /><br />Don't bother with this movie."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This guy is very funny, the best there is. I will be ordering more from you in the future. Your service is great and ordering is so easy. Thank You
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	I really love this DVD set, it was great to have all the shows in one compact package, and everything was beautifully done and in great shape.
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	While I'm a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio as an actor, the main story of the Departed was pretty uninteresting overall (not to mention confusing).  I wasn't sure what was even happening half the time because of how clumsy the story rolled along with quick snapshots of storyline immediately leading into other short scenes.  The whole movie was created this way, almost appearing as a documentary.<br /><br />Furthermore, the Irish accents made it hard to understand what some of the people were even saying.  You have to know the Irish to understand some of the sentences and expressions that were used in this film.  I believe understanding the Irish way of life is extremely important in order to get what the movie is about.  If the story was maybe more focused instead of just going into the same confusing pattern of frequent short scenes all attached together in an attempt to make a BIG story, maybe I would have enjoyed the movie more.  Again, I can't say enough about Leonardo Dicaprio's performance.  He was excellent.  Unfortunately the story wasn't good or presented in an easy to understand manner to keep me interested.
B00447G29S	3.0	b	"I had read that this movie cost 160 million to make, and the special effects are amazing at times, but I really could not get into the weird digital animation, it was like the characters were alien, I could not really connect with any of the leads, especially the main character, he seemed so void of emotion and otherworldly, I mean could they have at least made their eyes not so dead?  On some level the film is quite beautiful, and I appreciate the enormous amount of work it took to get this film to look this way..I realize Zemikis was trying to give the movie the look of the books amazing illustrations and again on one level it works, but it sort of takes all the feeling out of the movie, I never really felt vested in the outcome of this kids trip, and the beginning of the movie, with the hobo on the top of the train was not only bizarre but more than a little spooky and i never really got his revelevance, he was never properly explained.  Hanks voices several character and he is alright i guess, but frankly they could have saved the money on his salary and gotten some unknown, I mean who really cared if Hanks was the voice?  I hope he at least did this thing for scale, but im doubting it.  I did like how the setting was the 50's, it added to the nastalgia and the CGI North Pole was fantastic, but the story waxed and wained and took a long time to get going, all and all hardly ""A Christmas Story""."
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	This was a steal of a deal!  I have watched and enjoyed these blu ray movies over and over!  The ONLY downside is that there is no digital copy, but who is going to watch an ipod movie over seeing it on the blu ray tv screen anyway?  Great investment, no regrets!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"I saw this in theaters and absolutely loved it. I could go on and on over the genius twists and themes expressed in this masterpiece, but I sadly do not have the time at the moment. Let me just say that I am very pleased with this movie and hope the next effort by M. Night is as enjoyable as this one.<br /><br />""I see the world, Lucius Hunt... just not as you see it""<br /><br />  -Ivy Walker"
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I bought both of Jeff's dvds.  He's entertaining, witty, sarcastic, talented and all of the above!  I expect we'll be hearing more of Jeff in the future.
B0006989TE	3.0	b	"This is a story of a closed society ruled be a small group of ""elders"" who have decided to try and shut out the world. It is reminiscent of similar closed societies that have made headlines over the last few decades and left one feeling decidedly grateful that one was not a part of this one. I can tell you, however, there is no Kool-Aid involved in the ending.<br /><br />The elders have identified an outside threat from which the village must be defended and the members of the community are never allowed to forget the dangers lurking outside. Although they understand there are towns outside, these towns are places of evil which must be avoided.<br /><br />The storyline of the movie is based on a need to dare these dangers in order to bring in some needed supplies from outside. The one that circumstances elects just happens to be blind so that further complicates the journey. Some interesting plot twists are revealed which helps make sense of the overall situation; the viewer begins to get background information which explains what has happened in the past that helped shape the village into what we see during the movie.<br /><br />There is some good suspense built up with the settings and the acting contributing to the whole process. I found it difficult to relate to any of the characters and had some difficulty really caring what happened to them. It was sufficiently involving to hold our attention all the way to the end but we will likely not want to watch is again.<br /><br />This is definitely one to watch before buying; its appeal to you will be a matter of personal preference."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	Scorcese is a visual genius, I mean he is able to center the whole film and the whole action on the feelings, suffering and pleasure he can concentrate in the eyes of his actors that are piercing and even branding our own eyes that are trying to imagine the inside of their minds like voyeurs launched onto a world of violence and paranoid thirst for power. The art of this director is to get his actors into situations that will create fear in us and to direct these actors so well that our fear will be the simple reflection of the fright they express in their eyes, essentially their eyes, and also their words. The action of the film is then not that important since it is nothing but rotten cops and rotten gangsters that are trying to infiltrate their respective sides incognito of even the people on their own sides. We are the only people to know who is a mole and who is not, and yet, even so, Scorcese manages to bring a final mole out of the woodwork in the last two minutes of the film. And is the police mole infiltrated among the gangsters really better than the others ? Maybe yes, but it is so tenuous and brittle an impression that we could doubt it. The most important pleasure we find here is that the three main actors are not disappointing our expectations. Nicholson is not abandoning himself to his traditional ticks and habits. Damon is a perfect young prince that can conquer any heart and yet that is so rotten that he appears austere and cold when he turns vicious and fearful. Dicaprio is the greatest satisfaction for us because he is so well directed that he finds some harshness and he uses his eyes so well that we really believe his lovely face is nothing but the mask of a hyena and his straggling beard is the furious mane of some buzzard. And yet we tremble for him and we suffer with every anguished tremor on his face. Apart from that it is quite obvious that Scorcese must have found some tremendous enjoyment in directing three men in that dramatic and tragic situation. No film is wasted on any sentimentalese mash. It is all raw granite and solid quartz.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	Maybe I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  It is still a typical Hollywood production, but had great imagery, decent acting, and a believable story.  This won't go down in history as the most amazing movie ever, but it was entertaining for a Friday night movie night.
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	"whine, whine, whine. all you people do is whine. ""lucas ruined my childhood, lucas ruined star wars and indiana jones"" whine, whine, whine. LUCAS IS THE AUTHOR OF STAR WARS AND INDIANA JONES, HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS, IT'S HIS STORY!!! i hate all the lucas bashing, without him, you'd still be watching cheap ed wood sci fi movies. mr lacayo said it best ""this movies is awesome and i love all indiana jones. i don't understand why people can't wrap their minds over this story line. most people seem to think that lucas pulled this story out of his ass but the crystal skull mystery is real!!!! the myths surrounding extraterestials and latin america are real!!! i'm a latin american and i really loved this story because their definitely is speculation into how the mayans, incas, and aztecs created some of their artifacts. THIS STUFF IS REAL MYTHOLOGY PEOPLE, WAKE UP!!! also, it seems people didn't understand the concept of the anti-communist/post nuclear/50's era they were going for. to me, it's not lucas that doesn't have an idea or clue but YOU CLOSE MINDED PEOPLE!!!"""
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie can be watched by all. Have watched it a few times now and laugh every time.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	Well thought out movie plot.  Great visuals, good acting, some innovative characters.  The movie makes you think.  Like all sci-fi movies, there are a few hiccups, but, overall, this is a great sci-fi movie.  Watch it.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"With stunning visuals with a flawless script and cast ""Prometheus"" clearly shines as the star sci-fi film of the new decade. The epic masterpiece of veteran director, Ridley Scott, tells of a group of scientist searching the the ultimate question, ""Where do we come from?"" and finding the horror of the truth. Perfectly paced, and a beautiful cast lead by the superb Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), with nods to its father masterpiece and a clear ending which perfectly sets up the beginning of  ""Alien"", and the hopeful possibility of the continuation of Elizabeth Shaw's adventures, it could possibly be the best movie of the year."
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	Richly colored.  I enjoyed that a moral behavior was emphasized.  Fun characters with which you can relate.  Well done!
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"The movie wasn't that scary I'll admit, but the love story side-plot made up for it. It was creepy at parts, but I found the scene where you first get a chance to see  ""those we don't speak of"" anti-climactic..for reasons I won't say or I'd spoil the film. I think Shamalan should try a romance genre movie next since I found this one so...sweet. The part where the main characters first touched (when he pulled her in the house in slow-motion with the music) was just beautiful. My friend turned to me after that part with a smile and said, ""Ooh, I didn't know this was a romance! That was good"".<br /><br /> It's a well-rounded movie with a little bit of everything--and the whole premise of the movie was clever. The soundtrack is amazing as well. I recommend this movie for those looking for an alternative to slasher films.<br /><br />Cleveland, OH"
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This is a must see!  I have already watched this twice and laughed more the second time around.  I know I could watch it again and laugh more! I would definately recommend.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	Good stuff!  The Blu-ray looks great. And its nice to know that more Iron Man is coming in 2010.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	"This movie was a victim of over-hype.  Everyone seems to be looking for the next ""exorcist"".  This is not a horror movie in the true sense of the genre, but is more of a creepy thriller that keeps one's interest and keeps you guessing.  Watch this movie without any expectations and you should be pleasantly surprised.  3.5 stars."
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	Wow--what a disappointment.  Yes--I've read all seven Harry Potter books and loved them, and yes--I adored the first four film adaptations of the Harry Potter books--but The Order of the Phoenix is head-spinningly  under-developed.  Why the producers just didn't  commit to a 3-hour film so they could have fleshed-out some of the critical story lines is beyond me.  Other people here have stated the problems with this film very adeptly.  Essentially, the viewer is just left in the cold--there's little explanation or background on how various developments in the story came to be, and the whole movie plays like a series of disjointed vignettes.  (And what's with Hermione's hair?  One minute it's almost blond...the next it's honey-auburn...and back again. ;> )  My son (who's never read any of the HP books) had to keep relying on me to explain various situations in this video--and soon I began to realize the only reason I COULD explain various scenes and situations was because I had read the books.  That shouldn't be the case.  While certainly the film can't reproduce every single scene and bit of dialogue in the book--it should be able to stand and be understood on its own.  This film just doesn't do that, though. My sincerest hope is that they re-hire Steve Kloves, who scripted the first four films brilliantly, to do the remaining two films.  `And going back to Chris Columbus or Alfonso Cuaro&igrave;n as director couldn't hurt either.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"This movie would be hilarious,if it wasn't so sad! Ben does like Borat, in suckering religious humanists into exposing their silly religion and their shallow selves. I learned a lot from this movie, and have thus lost a little of my ignorant bliss. He shows us how America is now ruled by Peer Pressured Propaganda ala Hitler Youth movement. Just as in the Inquisition when a religion became state sponsored, Lazy minded people have learned the party propaganda well enough to reach powerful positions, and now they work to keep their power by freezing ""science"" (religion) where they understand it, and spend all effort on fighting to keep from having any new ideas becoming popular, by declaring their theory of ""science"" as official, all-encompassing and irrefutable (religion), attacking anyone's credibility that dares not to conform. It does appear they have a firm enough grip to take us into another Dark Age or Nazi zeal movement, built upon hatred of any who oppose their religion."
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Product arrived before due date and in excellent condition. I would recommend this seller.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	Twilight on steroids for Kristen !! James bitting Bella was very dynamic drama ! Well as Snow White her reactions were almost continuous in her escape through the forest to her fight with the evil Queen !! The emotional roller coaster was really screaming as she pulled me through each episode !! The burnout from retakes she must experience must be beyond belief ! Kristen sure has my vote, and what ever she gets for playing these parts she deserves and should get more !! Now I'm a total fan !!!! She is a Super Star !!!!  A mild shock set in on Snow White's second run on the Big Screen(first time on computer) the next day !! The world's most beautiful victim getting hammered right to end !! LOVE This version of Snow White !!!!
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	I was impressed at how Kristen acted in this movie, she indeed met and passed my expectations. Chris Hemsworth also provided an interesting role in the movie same as Sam Claflin.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	"My son and I watched Cars on the big screen and I LOVED it! The songs were perfect--especially Real Gone and Life is a Highway.<br /><br />I've just watched the movie again, twice, on DVD. Unfortunately, my 25 inch TV screen doesn't do this movie justice! (It's one of those movies that pack a wallop when watched on the big screen...)<br /><br />The realism achieved in this movie is amazing, especially with Lightning's shiny red paint job and the ""fumes"" rising from the drag cars. The writing is especially clever, too. (Look for the shapes in the rocky background at Radiator Springs.) For example, Harv, Lightning's fast-talking publicist/agent admonishes his client to get out of ""Radiation Stinks"" (you gotta hear it to appreciate it.)<br /><br />Every single time I watch this movie, I choke up twice during the last race. There are some critics who say that Cars doesn't have ""heart"" like Toy Story or other Pixar features. I can't help but wonder if we're talking about the same movie! I feel that Cars has more heart than ANY Pixar movie thus far--especially as it shows that winning isn't everything and that dignity is found in much more than an ""empty cup"" (like the Piston Cup).<br /><br />The voices in this movie are perfect, especially Owen Wilson as Lightning and Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. (Gosh, what a scene stealer that Mater is! And the funny thing is, if you watch the 16-minute ""Inspiration for Cars"" clip, you'll see the actual Mater--who sounds a lot like the character!)<br /><br />Speaking of the 16 minute Inspiration clip, I'm surprised that this DVD didn't have more extras--not even a commentary or movie video or sample story boards or anything! That was a disappointment, I admit. (I'm used to Disney packing the extras on there! Heck, I found out neat trivia bits--like why number 96 was chosen for Lightning's car--but I didn't find this out from the DVD!)<br /><br />However, the 16-minute clip was quite touching, especially hearing how the director was inspired for Cars. Turns out that he has several boys and his wife said to him one day: ""You know, we supported you through Toy Story 1 and 2 and your other projects...but one day, you'll wake up to find that your little boys are now off to college.""<br /><br />This sobering realization spurred him to take an entire summer off with his wife and kids--a road trip in a motor home. He said it was the best time of his life. Alas, he combined the two loves of his parents (his mother was an artist and his Dad was a car buff) to create the wonderful movie Cars, which also reflects his newfound wisdom: you can push, push, push for that next accomplishment, and one day realize that you're friendless or perhaps alone.<br /><br />There's also some great laughs in this movie; I LOVE the tractor-tipping scene with Mater and Lightning! (OMG--and that Frank is scary!)<br /><br />As I said, the extras are slim pickins:<br /><br />--New animated short Mater and the Ghostlight (Amusing. Fans of Mater will *especially* love this short!)<br /><br />--Academy Award-nominated animated short: One Man Band (This was the cute short about two deuling musicians fighting for a coin that a girl wants to throw into a fountain. It's the same short shown at the theater before the Cars movie.)<br /><br />--John Lasseter's inspiration for Cars (Very good. Inspirational in its own right.)<br /><br />--Ratatouille teaser trailer (A movie about a mouse in France with expensive tastes)<br /><br />--Deleted scenes<br /><br />This is an exceptional movie in terms of script, voice acting, music, authenticity, and animation. Car and racing lovers will no doubt love it, as will fans of Pixar. (Personally, I can't STAND car racing--or country music--but I loved both the soundtrack and the plot! Goes to show that one doesn't HAVE to be into cars to enjoy this movie.)"
B0090XJJT6	2.0	b	Fine acting aside, the story is confusing as anything.  Adding to the confusion is casting three similar characters (Damon, DiCaprio, Wahlberg) with three hunk leading men blondes and you try keeping track of who is who.  Overrated and clearly merited only as a lifetime achievement award for Martin Scorsese.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	It's obvious why this television series won so many awards.  It's amazing.  I only wish that taking history in school could be as interesting.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	I bought this for my husband, but I'm not sure which of us enjoys it more!  Jeff Dunham is hysterical and this is him at his best!
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Not only is the film a propaganda piece for Intelligent Design, it was simply ham handed film making. Rapid flashes of Nazi film clips made for a heavy propaganda feel for this film. Don't waste your money. This is not a film that debates ID and Evolution. This is simply a hack job without supporting facts. In other words..Lies. Go to www.expelledexposed.com to see the facts behind the myths.
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	This was a really boring Thor movie. Oh, wait. It wasn't a Thor movie? That explains why he wasn't using Mjolnir. Go ahead and waste two hours watching this - I did. The best part's of this movie were, of course, the villain. Charlize Theron tried so hard to make her character good n' scary, but the dialogue was too...dumb. But she was still the only interesting character on the screen. The CGI was really good. Actually, the CGI was the best actor in the whole film. I think that they should animate Kristen Stewart's upper lip - because it doesn't do anything.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	If you are reading this, than chances are you already have an interest in the movie and what others think; that being said, there is no need to review the plot and scrutinize everything that happens in this film.<br /><br />Getting straight to the point; the acting in this film is suberb; and the directing is also top-notch.  The twists and turns that this movie provides are amazingly crafted and well-executed.  I was never a big fan of Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio, but his performance in this film has earned him my respect!<br /><br />Check this movie out if you haven't already and definetly add it to your collection.  It may be a re-make, but it will develop into its own classic over time!
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	i wasn't sure it would, but it arrived in time to wrap and give as a christmas gift. whew.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Greatest comedy, performer ever.  Can't see any movement in throat, mouth or lips  is unreal.  Everyony should  own this DVD.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"The problem with most reviewers is that everyone is expecting the ""shocking"" ending of Shyamalans previous films. By trying to 'guess the plot twist', you are not paying attention to the movie. The subtleties of the characters and their complex relationships is what makes this film great. Watch it again..."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Jeff Dunham's DVD, Spark of Insanity, is absolutely hilarious.  I first saw it at a New Year's Eve party at a friend's house, and everyone just howled with laughter as we watched it.  His characters are so well acted, and each one has its own definite identity.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I love True Blood and I had to have the first season.  I looked at a couple of different stores for prices and I found that Amazon.com was the best place to get it.  It was cheaper than most places and it was delivered super fast!  I will use this website again and again.  I love Amazon.com!
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	He is one of the best, get ready to start laughing and not stop.  We have watched it numerous times since we got it and enjoy it over and over.  Hope to see him in person.
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	I would give this movie more than two stars if it actually had an ending.  The movie kept my interest but at the end, did not deliver the goods.  I don't like to make up my own endings.  That is why we have screenwriters.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	I absoluty loved this movie and every potter movie as a matter of fact...i rented them all from Amazon and then purchased them because i love them so much<br />So quick and eat working with Amazon
B00447G29S	5.0	b	The Polar Express is such an excellent family movie. My 5 year old daughter watches it every day all year long!
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"My experience of seeing Prometheus in the cinema ended like this:<br /><br />The final scene finished, cut to black. A few audience members chuckled. I sat there for a few seconds, processing what had just transpired in front of me for the last two hours, before rising from my seat and making my way toward the exit. I bumped into an older man in business attire--I must have looked as crestfallen as he did, because the first thing out of his mouth when we made eye contact was ""Jesus, wasn't that awful?"" I nodded in agreement, not really sure what to say. As we staggered out of the cinema together, my companion continued ""I love Ridley Scott, but that really was his worst film. I can't believe how bad it was.""<br /><br />I wouldn't say it's Ridley Scott's worst film, but it definitely is a disaster.<br /><br />There was a point about twenty minutes into this film when, despite all my reservations, my fannish adulation welled up and I was fully prepared to love it--the original ALIEN is perhaps my favorite film of all time. I was handing myself over to Ridley Scott on a silver platter. The scenes introducing David were wonderful (minus the clunky Shaw dream bit). The score was better than I had expected, with lots of excellent passages not featured on the terribly assembled soundtrack album. I suddenly felt a rush of hope from it all.<br /><br />I don't feel like I can accurately assess Prometheus, because I don't think what I saw *was* Prometheus. What I saw was an extended two hour *trailer* for Prometheus. This film features one of the worst edit jobs I have ever seen in a theatrical film. It has clearly been brutally hacked to ribbons--entire scenes are obviously transplanted from elsewhere in the plot, sliced apart, and haphazardly thrown into the midst of other scenes without any thought toward narrative whatsoever. Shots jostle against one another seemingly at random, and the entire film is without any sense of momentum or dramatic tension. Worse still, several scenes are obviously sloppily rewritten, last minute reshoots (the Shaw/Holloway bedroom scene, the Janek/Shaw infodump in the third act--check the deleted scenes section on the upcoming Blu-ray for the original versions that were better written and inexplicably cut).<br /><br />As for the rest of it, this movie is essentially one scene of idiocy leading into another into another into another:<br /><br />Janek abandons his post to have sex with Vickers, and even though there is a huge crew on this ship (most of whom mysteriously disappear for the entire runtime until it is time to get killed later on--seriously, where the hell do all these people go for most of the movie?!) there is NO ONE who bothers to keep an eye on the two crew members trapped in an alien structure--no one even records the feeds and watches them later before going in after them the next morning.<br /><br />This stupidity leads into the infamous Hammerpede scene, in which Milburn inexplicably waffles between an atrocious Southern accent and a normal American one, touches a clearly threatening alien snake creature like a total idiot, screams like a frat boy getting hazed while it attacks him, and then reduces the audience to hysterical laughter as it rams itself down his throat in comically OTT fashion.<br /><br />This then leads into Holloway waking up, seeing a clearly freakish and horrible tendril coming out of his eye, and then telling no one, because he is not just an insufferable jerk, but, like everyone else in this film, an insufferable moron as well.<br /><br />This depressing inanity extrapolates to pretty much every scene in the movie.<br /><br />The alleged story itself is merely a line for Ridley Scott to hang his stunning visuals upon, but even those cannot be enjoyed due to the madly rushed pacing; we are not allowed to absorb ourselves into these gorgeously production designed corridors or alien spaces, because Scott refuses to let a single shot last for more than two seconds. The plot is wafer thin. Characters are wholly uninteresting or outright idiotic, and Elizabeth Shaw is so poorly developed that despite her eye-rolling Hollywood backstory, this Ripley expy amounts to nothing more than Noomi Rapace running around looking winded for most of the proceedings. The only cast member who makes a solid impression is Michael Fassbender, whose work here is stellar.<br /><br />The tired, ersatz plot points come thick and fast (many of them alarmingly reminiscent of AVP, and at least a few of them shamelessly lifted from The X-Files--the Mulder/Scully dynamic, Shaw's scientific background and her faith in God, her crucifix becoming a plot point, the Black Oil...), and the silly new ""mythology"" is woefully ill-conceived -- the Engineers started all life on Earth...and then sat around for billions of years waiting for it to evolve into something like them? And apparently Jesus was an Engineer? And the reason the Engineers decided to wipe us out 2000 years ago was because we crucified Space Jesus? (Seriously.)<br /><br />With all this cringe-inducing material, the best thing about the film then is how completely inconsequential it is--it provides no direct link to ALIEN, and therefore hopefully spares its masterful forebearer any ill aftereffects by association. ""There is nothing"", says Peter Weyland when he finally meets his maker, another one of the script's faux-profundities that does not so much say anything for life itself, as it does more accurately sum up the film around it."
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	"Amazing movie, action packed, and exciting.  Robert Downey, Jr. has great comedic timing and sense of sarcasm, yet you also see him develop a sensitivity towards what is really being done with the weapons his character develops.  Jon Favreau has outdone himself, and Jeff Bridges is perfect for Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger.  You've never really seen him as a villain, so this is an interesting turn for him.  Gwyneth Paltrow is amazing- so great as Pepper Potts.  Terrence Howard (Rhodey) supports Downey, Jr. so well- he offers that ""down to Earth"" behavior that Tony Stark needs to stay grounded himself."
B001IA2PTK	1.0	b	From the brainless script to the zombie-like performances of Harrison Ford and Karen Allen (Allen, in particular, acts like she's eaten a fistful of Ambien before each take, simply grinning behind vacant eyes...), to the CGI gophers and the fact that Indiana Jones doesn't do anything but walk around observing other people doing things for most of the movie, this was a complete failure.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Spark Of Insanity is a hilariously entertaining video! All our friends are hooked on Walter and Achmed. It's been a great gift to give out for birthdays and Christmas presents.  All ages can enjoy Jeff Dunham.
