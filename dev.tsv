B001684L0A	5.0	b	What an amazing series and without commericals this is definitely the way to go.  This series was cast really well, great script, scenery, costumes, make up etc.  Truly worth the money for a week's entertainment.
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	Although I own this awhile back and been using it for almost 2 years.  Its just as the title.  Insanity is correct.  I recall the days of nauseating moments as I wasn't use to all the sudden transitions and now this is considered mild compare to the more recent ones as I've seen that they're more intense and you hardly have breaks in that.<br /><br />You'll see and feel the results.  For the first full month if you haven't done it yet, will be the most intense and you'll have moments of dizziness, feeling like throwing up.  P90X is more of a warm up to me than this.<br /><br />That's how intense, but, once you get use to it. it won't be a problem.  I wouldn't recommend it for people with back problems or people with shortness of breath.  I know that's common sense, but, seriously, this is quite intense.<br /><br />My body is toned from my back, chest, abs, legs, and buttocks.  Although not required, but, makes my hikes more easier especially the strenuous ones. This is a great way to lose weight and fine tune your body before or during the times you're bulking up to be more lean.<br /><br />Results are good but, its not for everyone.  If this isn't your own, luckily, there are many other different workout programs other than this and P90X.  Choose what is best for you.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	When I got the insanity workout package it really look new. Everything was in there that they said would be and it didn't even look used! It was packaged properly so my stuff would get damaged too!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Ben Stein's documentary detailing modern academia's discrimination against any who dare to even propose that the universe (and life) came into being as a result of design, not by accident or mere coincidence, is probably one of the most important works of film since Edison. It is truly amazing that the intellects that created and propagate the currently held views about the big bang and the origins of man, cannot grasp the irony inherent in their intelligently designed theories. What are the laws that govern randomness? Even more interesting, nowhere in evolutionary theory is the subject of the origins of human consciousness addressed. Wasn't it the faculty of human consciousness that designed the theory of evolution? Should this matter? Watch this video!!!
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	I purchased the Iron Man blu-ray and it is missing the scene after Stark shows off the new weapon.  He gets into the hummer, doesn't let his buddy in, saying this is the fun vehicle.  In the movie, he talks with the soldiers and drinks.  On my disc, it doesn't have any of that.  The next scene shows the vehicle blowing up and him having surgery in the cave.<br /><br />What's up with that?
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"It is my daughter's favorite movie.  She watches it a couple times a week.  A very enjoyable movie.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5U832"">Cars (Full Screen Edition)</a>"
B001KZG99A	1.0	b	The copy that I received is scratched. So, its not playing as it should. I have sent an email to the company and hopefully i will be able to exchange it for a non-scratched one. This is the first time I've ever had an issue, usually everything is great quality.
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	"So first we had X-men, then Spiderman and afterwards other countless Marvel Comic adaptations that were either majorly or moderately successful. But what do we have to expect for Iron Man, does it live up to the expectations of the fans, does it match up Spidey or X-men? Honestly it does; this adaptation proves that the comic book genre can still bring a character from the pages of a comic and yet maintain it fresh and new to a vast broad audience.<br /><br />In this first and clever adaptation of ""Iron Man"" we have Tony Stark, A genius and ambitious weapons business man who finds himself after being captured by Terrorist. These terrorist have weapons built and designed by Stark; they need Stark's help to build a super intelligent missile known as ""the Jericho"". In his attempt to create this weapon Stark creates a better and more efficient weapon...obviously Iron Man.<br /><br />The movie is a popcorn flick above all, it does however mange to create a very well crafted origin storyline; maybe not on the level of Batman Begins or Superman: The Movie, but it still brings in a good transition of how Stark finds his true destiny and purpose. The effects for the film are stupendous all the way. The only problem I found with the movie was 2 things. One the later half of the movie changed from what seemed to be a serious comic book movie, into an adrenaline fueled action extravaganza. Sure action is cool, but the way the ending was placed with him fighting the other Iron Man...it felt sort of silly; As if the ending was just a filler to have Iron Man facing someone for the hell of using more effects and having the audience feel the use of the 135 million dollar budget for the film. Above all this the movie is still a triumphant adaptation; the majority of the characters are superb in their acting. Downey Jr excels marvously as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and it's a great movie to watch with the family...I think. Anyways a must own by fans of the genre or new comers.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3  OUT OF 5"
B001IA2PTK	3.0	b	"I wanted to preface my review by saying that I am a huge Indiana Jones fan and was looking forward to this movie more than any other in recent memory.<br /><br />With that said, here is my to the point review...SPOILERS SPOILERS and more SPOILERS<br /><br />The opening segment, like its predecessors, was unique (Elvis music and a 50's car racing military vehicles as a sort of nod to American Graffiti) and definitely brought a smile to my face as Indiana Jones is dragged out of a car trunk and after getting to his feet, he reaches down for the oh so famous fedora and places it on his head.<br /><br />The movie from this point until the closing credits was a rollercoaster of good and bad, something I am not used to in Indiana Jones movies. Instead of constant narrative, I am just going to throw up a list of good and bad like I have seen others do, with some explanation/summary of why I think it is good or bad.<br /><br />GOOD<br />1. The actors/characters do a very good job with a rather weak script. Ford chews the scenery as Indy and plays him in the ""aw shucks"" way he always has, except for signs of maturity. His quips and one-liners are still good, but not of the level of the other three movies. Karen Allen does a good job but seems more like a female sidekick than a love interest (as in Raiders). Shia Labouf plays well, Shia Labouf, as is typical with this young actor. This is nothing bad, but he needs to mature as an actor some. He does have some good lines and fight scenes with Ford. Blanchett does an okay job with her over-the-top role, but pales in comparison with past Indiana Jones' villains. In fact, and this seems to be echoed by many others, there weren't too many moments where you thought the Russians would really harm Indy and Co. except for some action fights and Indy's one on one with the ugly Russian. For the most part, the characters/actors do a good job.<br /><br />2.The music is always good in these movies, BUT come on John Williams, you are one of the greatest composers out there who always manages to create one lingering melody that can be indentified with all of the movies you score, but in this one, all that stood out was echoes of melodies from the prior movies (particularly Raiders and Last Crusade--so much of Last Crusade, that it even ENDED WITH the musical cue from Last Crusade). The only reason this isn't moved down to the ""BAD"" is because the music is great, despite nothing very original.<br /><br />3. The action scenes are very well choreographed and despite some who say there is too much CGI, I for one did not think it was a distraction (as in the Star Wars prequels) but more of a useful tool to showcase some really good action scenes. Sure it is hard to believe a 65 year old is swinging from a whip (more than he ever has before) but with the CGI and stuntmen, suspension of disbelief is possible.<br /><br />BAD<br />1. The plot. It was bloated and unfocused. In no less than 20 minutes, we have Indy being dragged from a trunk, escorted into an AREA 51 warehouse, Indy locating a crate with a metallic coffin for an alien corpse from his discovery in Roswell in 1947, him being betrayed by his colleague, Indy escaping from the warehouse with a glimpse of a cracked box (ark of the covenant peaking out), then concludes with Indy walking into a ""dummy"" neighborhood where an atomic bomb test is seconds from happening and he gets into a lead lined refrigerator and BAM, he goes flying into the air as the bomb goes off. The refrigerator lands and rolls many times and then Indy gets out. He dusts himself off and looks at the mushroom cloud. Radiation anyone? Head trauma from bouncing around in the fridge, anyone?  This was one of several ""I can't believe they did that"" moments.<br /><br />2. The quicksand scene where Indy and Marion are being dragged down and she tells him that Mutt is their son. COME ON. I felt insulted as a fan and viewer. Any movie that has the hero tagging along with his son usually ends up being too tongue-in-cheek and corny. Why not have the big reveal occur with Mutt's life is in danger or more towards the end?<br /><br />3. Mutt (Shia) swinging like Tarzan on vines with a bunch of monkeys. Completely useless scene that acts like an unintentional gag.<br /><br />4. A redo of the cliff jeep chase scenes from Raiders. It was like Spielberg wanted to see what that scene would look like with CGI now.<br /><br />5. The jeep/boat scene going over not one, not two, but three waterfalls--each increasingly unbelievable. This was like Spielberg wanted to redo the classic unbelievable scene from Temple of Doom in CGI and make it three times as unbelievable.<br /><br />6. The UFO rising from the ground and taking off, which follows the appearance of an alien that looks just like the one from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. (I rolled my eyes and I heard sighs in the audience. I swear if E.T. had popped up or the music from E.T. or Close Encounters played, I would not have been surprised.)<br /><br />7. Indy getting married was the final ""oh come on"" with me--oops, no--it was the door being blown open and his fedora floating into the chapel that was the final ""oh come on."" If Shia had put it on and winked at the camera, Indiana Jones would be dead to me.<br /><br />Overall, the bad outweighs the good and that is a shame. Obviously, it is hard to recapture the magic (the lightning in a bottle they caught three times before) after 20 years. I have to shake my head when I read interviews where Spielberg and Co. are asked why it took nearly 20 years and they always say they were waiting on the perfect script. This script is not perfect but not terrible either, it just was not focused. They went in too many directions and even the ending seemed rushed. Even the biggest Indy fans will be disappointed with this average 4th entry in the franchise."
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	I first want to say that I do not understand all the poor reviews that state Insanity is just too difficult, I didn't lose the 20,30,40 pounds, it's not for people with bad joints, causes injury (and now I'm ruined for life), etc.  I don't want to minimize their complaints - especially if they got hurt - but it is called INSANITY for the love of God!  Was that not clear at all in the infomercial?  Were the repeated warnings of 'this is not for everyone' unclear?  Were the disclaimers of 'results may vary' not clear?  When doing the workout, do Shaun's constant reminders to 'rest and get back at it', listen to your body, etc. not register?  And for those with joint problems - why on earth did you ever think an extreme program with jumping exercise would be for you?  Bottom line - lack of common sense does not make this a bad product.<br />I am a stay-at-home mom of two kids and I am anything but athletic.  I am no couch potato - but I haven't seen the inside of a gym for about 8 years.  I get my exercise keeping up with my kids and cleaning my house/yard - period!  Unfortunately, after having my last child and turning 40, that wasn't cutting it anymore.  I was/am about 30 lbs overweight starting this program and I have been at it for 22 days now.  Let me restate - I am NOT athletic and I am NOT in shape!  In the beginning, I could do only 3 reps of a few of the exercises!  It was sad! The point is, I listened to my body and rested when I needed to but didn't quit.  Anything involving the 'Plank' position was next to impossible due to my weak little arms and the fact that I have had C-sections with each child, so my abs and core were weak. So I modified those a bit, and over just this short amount of time I am proud to say that I am doing all the exercises correctly and am up to at least 15 reps of even the toughest exercises, I have lost 4 pounds and am nearly down one pant size. I really feel as if I am on way to losing the 30 lbs and maybe more.  But I don't expect it all in the first 60 days because my starting point was so weak.<br />Bottom line - this is an excellent fitness program for just about anyone who doesn't have health problems, uses good old common sense, takes it at their own pace (don't 'dig deeper' until you feel you can), and doesn't expect to grace any fitness mag covers after 60 days.  Shaun T is wonderful, very motivational and easy to follow.  I am really looking forward to seeing my results after the next 38 days.  And I thoroughly expect to continue to use Insanity in the intervals suggested.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	It is 2:20 am in the morning and I could not stop watching until the end. It is amazing to me how blind we really are to what we are doing to ourselves and to our nation. This movie truly helps you see what is going on. If you have any interest in what you're eating...then watch this movie!!
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	Although unsettling, this is a must see documentary.  I applaud the makers of this film for their courage to show the American public the hidden reality of how our food comes to market.  After viewing this documentary, you will want to make changes in what you eat and how you decide on food purchases.  It will change your life.
B002QZ1RS6	2.0	b	This dvd selection and workout is not for everyone.  It is very hard and very fast paced.  Even some of the people demonstating the video could not complete the workout.  They focus on repetition as fast as possible.  This doesn't make sense to me because I have always been taught to focus on form so that you don't get hurt. There is no way to keep your form in these workouts.  Very expensive!
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	So, this was the movie that begun the summer season on 2008 and boy, it started with a bang. Iron Man collected more than 300 million USD just in North America and was praides almost universally.<br /><br />And with good reason, Iron Man is a very solid film, a proyect that in paper, in 2007 was secondary to other Marvel franchises, as Hulk, Daredevil, Fantastic 4 or X-Men. Today, i belive that with SpiderMan, it must be the good looking son in hearts of Marvel Excecutives.<br /><br />Directed in a very fresh way by Jon Favreau, Iron Man is a movie that took a very serious approach (serious, not dark) to it's source material. Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice as Tony Stark and embodies it with masterful audacity. he embodies the character and elevates it to the real world.<br /><br />the other members of the cast do ggod jobs from what they have to work, but from the script, they are secondary to Stark, who fills the screen for 95% of the film.<br /><br />I belive that the reviews should be done at the moment of the first seeing, (to measure first impact) and also after several viewings, because you can discover new details every watch, and after 5 or 6 times, a whole different picture might emerge. i can say that after multiple viewings, Iron Man is a solid, appealing and well excecuted piece of entertaining, but no perfect. Tha main problem with the film is the lack of an enemy that is in the same tone with the rest of the film, very similar to what hurted Batman Begins: in the last portion of the film, the to-that-moment-realistic and belivable, villain says bye bye to the real context of the movie and says hello to super-villain Mountain. I think that with a more serious and realistic nemesis, Iron Man could be in the League of The Dark Knight, Spider Man 2 or X Men 2 as the best the genere has to offer.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a very good movie, and another proof that Comic Book Movies are really what are holding Hollywood Economy in relative order...just see the top ten box-office movies, and count how many are from a genere that were once only for kids and geeks, but in the last 10 or 20 years, it has gained the respect of the most talented filmakers, and specially, of the adult audience all around the world.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	While some may have been disappointed of thing that were left out or slightly changed from the book, this movie did an excellent job of the sequence of the book and the main issues.  The acting was great, esp. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dolores Umbridge.  It was funny as much as it was dark.  If you are a Potter fan, you will love this movie!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	JEFF DUNHAM JUST GETS FUNNIER AND FUNNIER WITH EACH NEW PROGRAM.  CAN'T WAIT FOR A NEW ONE.
B0032CNOK6	1.0	b	Ben Stein should have to return any university degrees that he's been give to publish such unscientific drivel.<br /><br />Save your time/money--don't bother with this film.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"A WONDERFUL animated film, Cars, brings to the screen the story of a race-car with its eye on the Piston Cup trophy ""getting stuck"" in as small town just a few days before the big event.  As it turns out though, all is not as bad as it seems...<br />Owen Wilson (!!!), Paul Newman, Tom Hanks, Michael Keaton, John Goodman, Tim Allen, Jay Leno, Billy Crystal, Cheech Marin and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all EXCELLENT!<br />In short, Cars is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Madagascar, Hoodwinked, Antz and Monsters Inc."
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	Haven't seen the movie. It would never run over my roku even though it is a model Amazon claims will work. The customer service is ill equipped and had no idea how to get it working and then they promised follow-up that never was sent. When it works it works, when it doesn't Amazon has no plan to help.
B008UBYTRG	4.0	b	Jeff Dunham has done it again.  His new character Achmed is hillarious.  The bonus feature where is show him creating a new doll is great.  He watched his language and didn't go all the way this ime which disappointed me a little, but he was still hillarious.  A must have DVD.<br />Thanks for the laughs Jeff.
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	Pixar has always been a great movies.  Cars is no exception.  However, in terms of movie history, Cars was the last of the traditional Pixar.  Since then the stories have been more unconventional, following a rat who wants to cook, a robot love story, and a man who moves his house with balloons.  So, its fun to watch Cars, which follows the more traditional story of a hot shot car who learns the value of a little town life.  The characters are great, mader especially is funny, and the movie makes clever use of the car world.  Everything is car related, from cattle to the bugs (watch closely and you'll see).  Also, I appreciate the basis of the story, the lost world of Route 66, where people cared about there stop, rather than drove past only stopping for gas.  In short, the movie is a resounding success that should be seen. Also, the blu-ray is gorgeous.  It is demo quality, seeing the reflections off every car, every detail in the ground, and you really feel the speed during the races.  Overall, Cars is a great movie, that looks amazing.  Recommended for fans of fun movies for a younger audience.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	The consideration of a different view of the same story was very good.  Sometimes the story moved a little more slow than what I prefer, I am sure it is good for a younger age group.  However,I still enjoyed the new point of view.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	Excellent movie a true christmas classic!!! Enjoyed by the whole family!!! Great price and value!!! Great addition to the Christmas video library !!!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	I love this movie and my son was thrilled to get it for Christmas.  It came in a very timely manner from amazon and it was well packaged.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I was entertained with the movie and the slightly darker view.  I enjoy movies that aren't afraid to view things differently.<br />I like to be entertained and not always trying to learn a lesson.
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is an excellent video.  It will make you laugh throught the entire show.  I strongly recommend this purchase.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"I watch alot of foreign movies. ""Infernal Affairs"" is in my Top 5 List.  So when a stellar cast of movie actors/diector/procuction/engineers took this on in the form of THE DEPARTED I couln't wait. The film follows the original very closely. The love interests and ending are different.<br /><br />Having just finished the non-fiction book The Brotherhoods about the mafia cops in The New York Police Department, this plot of placing undercover crime members into police organizations is the real deal.  Jacks performance is great but of course one always wants more, after all he sets a high bar. Because of the high profile this movie has taken on I've found out there is a prequel and sequel to ""Infernal Affairs"" and that's where I'am going next.<br /><br />For those who have not seen the foreign version- Your going to have a GREAT TIME!!!"
B001684L0A	5.0	b	I rarely buy DVDs, but this series was so exceptional that I ... well, made an exception. I recommend it for any history buff; I learned a lot about the founding of the U.S. and the men and women involved. They were ordinary people who rose to an extraordinary challenge, becoming historic figures in the process. I loved (and have frequently referred to) one line of dialog whose gist is as true today as ever: The only thing most meetings accomplish is providing an opportunity for everyone to speak without anyone actually making any decisions or taking any action. Apparently the Continental Congress had the same problems as the 112th Congress faces. I guess some things never change.
B006H90TLI	4.0	b	If your idea of cinematic greatness must include 'real life plausibility', in other words things you would EXPECT to happen or not happen, then you'll nitpick this flick to death and probably be turned off by it. There were some things that happen that do seem a bit Hollywoodlike, but this is one movie that is so good, those instances can be overlooked.  Javier Bardem's character is on par with Hannibal Lector for nasty creepiness, and his killing sprees are comic book super-villianlike, in addition to the fact that he amazingly never draws attention of any sort throut (except for his last scene, oddly enough ) that aside, Bardems performance was amazing. I can't remember a villian SINCE Lector that was so effortessly creepy and subversive. One of the great cinematic villians, imo.<br />That said, the puzzling thing to me, was the  film title seems oddly inadequate because Bardems character and performance so dominated the movie. After watching, you'll remember this guy way more than Tommy Lee Jones character and situation. In fact, the last scene nearly felt like the Coens thought, 'hey, we better wrap this up with something poignent and reflective of our movie title!, so they gave Jone his infamous monologue at the end. Otoh! ,....you could also argue that it is just another in the long line of elements in this Coen movie that aren't clearly defined...you sorta are left to make up your own mind what kinda movie you're watching. Indeed, the sleight of hand characterwise, would almost have you believing Josh Brolin's character was the focus.<br />Ultimately though, some movies just have that combination of ingredients that make them so compelling to watch, you forget about questioning this or that or trying to pigeonhole what exactly your watching. The stark, absolutely no music background thruout the whole movie, the expansive cinematography, the richness of the unspoken implications of what is going thru each characters mind(how'd they pull that off? lol) , the incredible realness of the west Texas bit characters , Bardems ironic fate. There is art of craft here, flip a coin to see if you care to enjoy it on those merits alone, or not.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	This has got to be one of the best movies in a loooooong time.  If you haven't seen this movie, get your butt in gear and get it.  You won't be sorry.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	I highly recommend this movie to all married couples and those seeking marriage. This movie is powerful and touching there is something in this movie for everyone.
B001KZG99A	3.0	b	"Judging by all the accolades given to this movie you'd think it was the greatest thing ever invented by Man.  Calm down, people!  It's just a movie!  Yet another in the long, too long, line of superhero franchises.  It has its moments and Downey can be funny.  But if you want the true Man-in-high-tech-armor-fights-bad guys film than you need to see Robocop.<br /><br />In truth, there are so many similarities, plot-wise, that you could easily argue it's a rehashing of the 80's classic: man is critically wounded, has a second life inside an impervious suit, finds out he was betrayed, has showdown with a similarly super-powered but much bigger foe, etc.  Sure, the special effects are kinda' cool, but Robocop's is even more impressive, especially when you consider they did it the old-fashioned way -- using real models, no CGI. And for true biting satire and gallows humor you can't beat it.  Ah, they don't make `em like they used to anymore.<br /><br />PS -- It feels like the movie has a pro-military stance in that Stark's weapons are never shown to kill civilians (""collateral damage"") when used by the US military, which is what I was expecting.  Instead you only see terrorists using his state-of-the-art weapons (which would be a lot less likely; terrorists tend to be pretty low-tech).  That kind of ""black and white"" portrayal was odd."
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I'm biased. I loved the film, and saw it twice at the theatre. Downey was a surprise casting decision for me, but it works perfectly. He brings an attitude and maturity that a younger man would not have had.<br /><br />The film succeeds better than most comic book adaptations by not trying too hard to be cool. There is a realism in the narrative that is subtle, but effective. Luckily, even though it's an FX driven film, it's not edited in a way that draws your attention to them. That being said, the FX are INCREDIBLE.<br /><br />The final fight is fairly anti-climactic. BUT it's AWESOME from start to finish. Great funny gratuitous action.
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Awesome,<br /><br />My wife and I watch it whenever we're in a bad mood.<br /><br />Makes us laugh every time.<br /><br />We've started quoting scenes to each other around the house and we laugh at each other.<br /><br />A great purchase.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"Thumbs up, Ben Stein!!  Remarkable documentary that should be given prime-time special showing on major networks, let alone be seen in all variety of institutions.  He does a truly balanced mix of interviews, without much effort showing evolutinary scientists literally stumbling over their own words, and open-minded, free-thinking scientists making simple, powerful cases of what's simply inevitable and anavoidable - seeing true intelligence behind the design of every living thing around us, beginning with us.  And by far the best exposition of direct connection of Darwinian evolution to Hitler, and the arian race, and the war that he imposed on the world literally following the basic principle of Darwinian evolution, ""breeding"" the better, stronger race.<br />I can't reccommend this movie enough."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This was the funniest stand-up comedian in the whole world. Great jokes. I was entertained from start to finish!!!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"""Cars"" is the inventive, creative, and entertaining animated film of the year.  Plugging into America's love with the automobile the producers offer a timeless tale that is destined to become a cult classic.  This action packed show speaks volumes through the roar, rumble, romance and racing of hotrods, race cars, and sweet rides.<br /><br />The characters' witty names reflect their personalities and help with screen play motion:  ""Lightening McQueen"" (Bullitt and the Cooler King would've driven this racer), ""The King"" (Petty's Superbird always grabs my attention!), ""Tow Mater"", etc.  This movie is brilliant and funny.  Your entire family will enjoy this DVD.  Your little ones will, especially, like it.<br /><br />I always prefer the wide screen version, but have also watched a friend's full screen ""Cars"".  Both are great.  If you want good clean fun, with a poignant moral at the end (honor, loyalty, and friendship are more important than winning, fame, and money!) then ""Cars"" is the fun-flick for you.  Race down your DVD soon!<br /><br />Happy Thanksgiving!"
B0006989TE	3.0	b	I've enjoyed all of M. Night Shyamalan's films, but each one is a little weaker than the last. I'm glad I did not shell out money to see The Village at the movie theater. I'd recommend renting or watching this film on cable, but I would only buy it if were collecting Shyamalan's films or were a big fan of one of the stars. The film started out well enough, but became somewhat predictable. Sure the 'twist' at the end was interesting, but less remarkable than those from MNS's previous works. Overall, I'd say The Village is a watchable film...3-3.5 stars
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	"I just finished my first round of Insanity last Saturday, and am currently taking a week off before starting my next go around.  I'm a female college student, 5'10"", 160 lbs or so.<br /><br />When I was looking at buying Insanity in December I read all kinds of reviews and saw how many people were saying that they lost tons of weight and got in the best shape ever, blah blah blah.  I didn't want to lose very much weight, just slim down and get back in shape to start running when it got warm again.  So, I bought the program and got started.<br /><br />The first month was tough at the beginning, but as I kept going it got more and more manageable.  By the end I was able to make it all the way through the warm up without having to take a breather, which I figured was pretty good.  Then month two came around.  I knew it would be harder, but I guess I didn't expect just how physically draining it would be.  I have to work out at 6 am because it's the only free time I have during the day, and so it was tough to keep motivated.  I also wound up getting really bored with doing the same videos for a whole month, which didn't help the motivation issue.<br /><br />I did stick with it, though, and completed the program, only missing 2 workouts I think in the whole 63 days.  I didn't follow the diet plan because of various reasons, but I still eat pretty healthy.  And, I didn't lose any weight.  I don't even think I skimmed off any fat in the areas that were bugging me.  I pretty much see no change in how I look or how my clothes fit now (though my bf says my butt looks nicer, so I guess I'll believe him on that).<br /><br />I guess I would recommend Insanity to people who maybe have more weight to lose, or who are able to really devote a lot of time and energy to the videos and diet plan.  Like I said, I will be starting another round soon, but this time I altered the schedule to alternate weeks from month 1 and 2, so that I don't get as bored, and I replaced the recovery workouts that I hate with running and yoga days."
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"Yes, it won Best Picture and a lot of other awards.  Yes, a lot of critics praised it (although not as enthusiastically you might think).  And many people decry the movie as a lesser-work by Scorsese that the Academy awarded out of guilt, especially since ""Dances with Wolves"" beat ""Goodfellas"" for Best Picture in 1990 (WTF!).  And because a lot of people still don't like Leonardo DiCaprio and all the big Hollywood names attached, they also shrug it off somewhat. Not to mention the fact that it's a remake of a really good movie, ""Infernal Affairs"".<br /><br />There's so many reasons to want to think this is just okay, until you actually watch the movie.  It's unbelievably good, right up there with Scorsese's best work, and although I often disagree with the Academy, I really do believe it was the Best Picture of 2006.  The film is so rich with wonderful, powerful performances across the board, and the script is so entertaining and tense, filled with dynamic, hilarious characters and scenes that just jump out at you.  It's a violent crime film in line with ""Goodfellas"", ""Taxi Driver"" and Scorsese's other greatest hits in a way, but I think on many other levels it's a departure for him.  Stylistically, it's much more of a police procedural along the lines of some of the great television shows out these days like ""The Wire"" and ""The Shield"".  It's also respectful of the source material, offering a different enough take on ""Infernal Affairs"" but staying true to some of the best that film had to offer.<br /><br />I saw this movie three times in the theater.  I haven't done that in a long, long time (probably since ""Goodfellas"").  I bought the DVD, I love it, and I think time will be very good to ""The Departed"" overall.  The Leo-hate will finally be forgotten, as will the politics and the context of the Hollywood A-listers piling on, and we'll just be left with one of the most entertaining crime movies ever made.  And the fact that it's an entertainment and not a grandiose, Oscar-shilling ""important film"" is what makes it all the more successful and truly a great pleasure to watch."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	"Wonderful movie - so well done, and incredibly gripping. This is what I would call ""must-see TV""."
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	This was the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. The service was great and it came in in plenty of time to give to friends and family for christmas. I will order again with out a problem.
B001G2MB2G	2.0	b	"I have the 1-4 ultimate editions and in the Special Features disc there were interactive games and puzzles. Not in 5 and 6! What you get is an advertisement urging you to buy a disc with interactive games at your nearest DVD store. $40 bucks for the movie and ""Creating the World"" episode that I can watch on cable. The greed never ends."
B00447G29S	5.0	b	The Blu-ray offers a little better picture quality then the DVD but the sound (if you have external speakers) is what makes the upgrade worth it. Nothing beats having your walls shake when the train goes rumbling by. Now NETDEALZ who I purchased from through Amazon was another story. Before it even shipped the priced dropped $2 and within 5 days of me purchasing this and before it arrived it had gone from $18.69 to around $10. They would not match there own price and just all around bad customer service. So good product just bad seller.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	A stroke of genius. This miniseries shows the passion John Adams ever showed than any other President in our history.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I'm just about finished with the 2nd and final month of Insanity. All I can say is Shaun T is the best. I've been a big proponent of going to the gym and working out with weights and cardio machines. The ONLY reason I decided to go the ""workout-at-home"" route is because I had to work for several months in the Virgin Islands and I didn't want to use the lackluster gym at the hotel. Going into this, I thought that I was in great shape because I workout regularly and I eat well. Fortunately, Shaun T put me to shame! The Max Interval training method that Insanity uses is just crazy. No matter how good in shape you are, you're pushing your body to the max so you're always getting better and stronger. What little body fat I had is practically gone. I look and feel stronger. I am definitely more flexible since Shaun T emphasizes a lot of stretching. And my mid -30s heart just ""feels 'Ford Tough'"".<br /><br />So how does Insanity burn the fat and get you in the best shape of your life? You are constantly sweating. From the 5 minute warmup to after the DVD stops, you are sweating constantly. I have never worked out so hard in my life. This DVD set is everything that it advertises itself to be. The only thing it doesn't tell you is how hard it is to stick to the program because you're working out 6 days per week even though you may sometimes feel like throwing in the towel every day (note: 1 day is devoted to cooling down and stretching, but you end up sweating a whole lot on that day as well). Shaun T is a great motivator. But this workout is really insane. Even the people on the DVD who are all in excellent shape are stopping to catch their breath and shaking off muscle fatigue because Shaun T just doesn't stop.<br /><br />All in all, if you're up to what I believe is the ultimate workout challenge, pick up Insanity. You will definitely notice and feel a physical transformation from start to finish. Shaun T, you are the man!"
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	The director and acting in this film brought Stan Lee's legendary Iron Man to life in this outstanding film!  This film will herald the beginning of realism of comic book characters onto film! LOOK OUT! A must see!!
B001684L0A	5.0	b	Although the miniseries title and episodes focus on the life of John Adams, the strength of the film lies in the exceptional ensemble cast. It was impressive to see such giants as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, as well as the lesser known individuals, truly inhabited by the actors.<br /><br />The challenge of the series was to breathe life into those stories and lives we know so well. The filmmakers worked closely to David McCullough's outstanding book for the details, along with the human side of the story captured in the voluminous correspondence of John and Abigail Adams. The political, military, and personal issues were all thoughtfully brought to life. The design values of the film were also superb. Nothing looked stagy or stilted in the sets and costumes, which provided an unusual authenticity of period style for television drama. With each appearance of George Washington (David Morse), it was hard not to gasp due to the believability of his character.<br /><br />The drama of America's breaking from England for independence was an improbable story and one dependent on the courage and idealism of the individuals portrayed in this film. The personalities of these great figures make this program an accessible and rewarding experience for the entire family. For the patient viewer, what emerges from the John Adams miniseries is not merely a history lesson, but a drama with great relevance today. Simply put, we need more people in our country right now just like John and Abigail Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Washington, Knox, and, above all, the ordinary human beings heroically portrayed in this fine film!
B002QZ1RS6	1.0	b	I would give it no stars if it were possible... the item came damaged and when I tried contacting them to Exchange or return i never got a response. I still haven't got a response I don't recommend buying from this company.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This is a great family movie (so is entertaining for both parents and children) with good teachings and fun characters. Beware! Your children will want all the Cars merchandise to go along with the movie...
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	Spark of Insanity was far funnier than any previous shows in Which I have seen Jeff Dunham and his puppets.  Contrary to the one negative opinion I have read about the performance, I didn't have to gauge the reactions of audience members to know when it was time to laugh.  It was very funny, and I must say that his tackling an issue, such as terrorism, with comedy, was funnier than I would have even thought it would be.  Dunham is a very talented ventriloquist, with a fine sense of comedic timing.  I feel sorry for anyone who can't get a laugh out Spark of Insanity, their sense of humor is irreparably broken. Buy it, see it, enjoy it!
B00447G29S	4.0	b	"We bought this DVD just in time for Christmas.  The first time, we watched this movie with our 4 and 6 year olds and then included the 2 year old the next day during a second viewing.  All 3 boys LOVED it and wanted to watch it multiple times over Christmas vacation.  There were a few ""scary"" and tense parts of the movie, but everything turns out ok, and the boys were not worried about those parts after seeing them one time.  Great movie for the family!  Wonderful animation!  Beautiful music!  A thrill for everyone!"
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	"Have you ever noticed how Kristen Stewart is seemingly only in movies where there are 2 guys always surrounding her (The ""Twilights,"" ""Adventureland,"" ""The Yellow Handkerchief"")?  Here she plays the titled Ms. White, the rightful heir to her father's throne, who is now imprisoned.  Dad was murdered on his wedding night (the mother of Snow died earlier) by the beautiful Ravenna (an evil, juicy Charlize Theron).  Ravenna, it appears makes use of her great beauty by marrying and eliminated various kings.  She pulls this off for many years because of a spell she received that requires her to drain the life from the kingdom's unspoiled young women.  Snow White is too young, so in the cell she goes.<br /><br />There are several episodes of the ""mirror mirror on the wall"" chant but this mirror isn't just an animated glass mirror.  It is gold and becomes molten (think ""Terminator 2"") and forms a humanoid shape.  This version of the Grimm classic is appropriately dark and full of filmmaker wizardry, including a colorful section of mushrooms with eyes, forest creatures and a white stag.  An obvious homage to the Walt Disney original.  While the film waffles back and forth between light and dark it also has a tendency to bog down just when it starts to get good.<br /><br />The battle scenes are PG-13 cool enough and Kristen Stewart is fetching in her battle armor, but the film falls short of ""Game of Thrones"" (numerous unintended comparisons) in style and substance.  After about 8 years of imprisonment the now a young woman, Snow White manages to escape and enters the dark forest ultimately engaging a would-be hunter (Chris Hemsworth) and a childhood friend (Sam Claflin) as fellow combatants in an effort to dethrone the evil queen.  To the filmmaker's credit, Snow doesn't spend any time thinking of romance with either of the hunks longing for her favors.  She's obviously too busy planning the overthrow.  So who's the fairest of them all?  My vote goes to Charlize Theron."
B002VRZEYM	4.0	b	A better documentary is The Future of Food.<br /><br />Still, I applaud the existence of this documentary, to capture those audiences that will never read the book versions.
B004P9FAKW	2.0	b	Easily the worst film in the series to date.  The story is disjointed, likely the result of attempting to cram the longest Potter book into the shortest film so far.  The effects aren't very good and are a considerable step down from Goblet.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, generally you will see a smattering of special features on a primary disc with additional details added to a second disc.  Not the case here.  There is absolutely nothing on the primary disc but the film itself.  This would be acceptable if the technical quality of the film was outstanding.  It's not.  Far from it.  Watching on a 58 in. 1080i plasma with an upconvert player, there are significant pixelation issues, easily the worst I've seen on any film.<br /><br />Overall, a severe disappointment.  Not looking forward at all to what Yates (Director) does with Half-Blood Prince.
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	"The Departed<br /><br />Movie number 2 out of 5 in the list of Best Picture 2007 Oscar nominees was ""The Departed.""<br /><br />The film is destined to become a classic due to many aspects.  Not only will it, I predict, win the Best Picture award this year.  It will also become known as the one which finally won Martin Scorsese a long overdue Academy Award for Directing.<br /><br />Among the other reasons the classic label shall be thrust upon this great piece of filmmaking is an intense, but twist-filled tale of cat and mouse, good and evil, gangster and cop, and pure americana.  The last bit is a tad ironic since it's a remake of a Japanese thriller from a few years ago.<br /><br />With a cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, Anthony Anderson and others, the actors alone make this a film to behold.<br /><br />The plot involves Leo DiCaprio as a kid whose uncle made a few mistakes in his life and wound up killed by Frank Costello (Nicholson.) Later in life he joins the police force, and is offered a position by Sheen and Wahlberg  to help take down Costello and his Irish mob crew. While on the other hand, Matt Damon grew up admiring Costello and moving up the ranks within the Massachusets State Police through hard work and cunning. He's always thinking one step ahead of his superiors.<br /><br />The two lives of DiCaprio and Damon intertwine through minor 'almost' meetings and just misses.  Each of them has set out to detrmine who the rat is for the other side.  Each of them have the task of protecting their own lives and careers while helping those undeserving.  Yet, with all the similarities within each character, they're complete opposites.  Both of them make a living and income from a life of crime. One attempts to shut it down while commiting it elsewhere.  The other tries to commit crimes while wearing the facade he's trying to shut it down elsewhere.<br /><br />The movie is overall fun if nothing else.  For the movie buff who enjoyed Casino, Mean Streets, Goodfellas or any other underground urban gangster film, this is their type of adventure.  Even for some waiting and hoping again for the classic Nicholson craziness audiences love.  His boisterious mannerisms, cocky attitude and smartass evilness is all here in glowing technicolor.  The movie is violent to say the least, and gory especially near the end.  However, it's done reasonably and with merit because it's meant to get the point across of how violent and disgusting a life of crime can get.<br /><br />Clocking in at a little over 2 and a half hours, it's amazing just how little the movies paced dragged on.  Every frame is filled with either excitement, great drama, fantastic acting, or shocking gasp-worthy scenes.<br /><br />Even the music, Scorseses masterful use of classic rock songs from the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd (redone by someone else, unsure of who.) The music doesn't downplay the violence, instead it enhances it.<br /><br />I must say for anyone who doesn't care for Leo DiCaprio (I'm one of them,) this movie will change your mind a bit.  One should with all warrant, feel your heartstrings pull for this character in a tough spot no matter which path in life he chooses.  If anyone doesn't care for Matt Damon as an actor (my wife for example,) this movie isn't going to change your mind soon.  His character is one of pure arrogance and selfishness, one may feel like taking a crowbar to him within the first 15 minutes of his screentime.<br /><br />From the streets of deep, dark Boston, the story of brotherhood on both sides of the law is intriguing and disturbing and and joy to behold.<br /><br />Watch...and enjoy!!"
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	Buy it now, or send as a gift to someone who has not seen it, why are you still reading reviews, go click add to cart now!
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	As with all things Pixar, this is a great movie. Probably not my favorite of the bunch, but still a very great flick for kids and adults. If it's Pixar, it's going to be a winner.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	You already know the movie so all I can say is that the Blu-Ray has a much richer dynamic range, so buy it.
B00447G29S	4.0	b	Thought the movie was great in 3D and you can see it on a regular TV but, if you have a big screen TV, it would be so much better. It works on regular, don't get me wrong, but my son sits pretty close to the TV to really get the effect.<br />Thom
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	I missed this at the theaters so I wasn't expecting much after reading a lot of negative reviews.  I liked it.  It was mindless fun that made me forget about all the crap that's going on in the world for a couple of hours.  Nice blu-ray picture too.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Great, Great movie for any age. Even my husband sat and watched!
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"""Sin City"" is now on Blu-ray on two discs. One disc has the ""Recut"" version which adds about 6 minutes of story content, and also presents each story as a separate feature. There's not a big difference between this and the theatrical version. I think the theatrical version flows nicer, because it blends the stories together, so I recommend that for a first viewing. I enjoyed watching the ""recut"" version as a second viewing, because it's changed just enough to keep it feeling fresh, like listening to a favorite CD on shuffle."
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	Special Edition features are pretty fun, and the digital copy availability is a great feature, as always.  Despite the evils of the MPAA, this movie should be bought.
B005ZMUQCK	1.0	b	"Wow.  I though Pixar could do no wrong. But they leveled Owen Wilson, Larry ""the cable guy,"" and PAUL FREAKIN' NEWMAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This movie turns racing into a boring, flat, uninteresting, ""also animated"" film.  Pixar for so long defined memorable pictures that just happened to be animated.  So many companies turned out animated, uninteresting films. But not Pixar!!!  Until now...  What a disappointment.  We stopped the film 2/3 into it. We just didn't care."
B00447G29S	4.0	b	"""A grave and disappointing failure, as much of imagination as of technology."" - Manohla Dargis, New York Post<br /><br />""There's only so much that digital information can convey about what makes a human being human."" - Ty Burr, Boston Globe<br /><br />""There's a deeper, shivery tone, instead of the mindless jolliness of the usual Christmas movie."" - Rober Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times<br /><br />""The first film in a long time to capture that ineffable whatever it is that people hope to find when they go to a Christmas movie."" - Mike LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle<br /><br />These reviews are a small fraction of the professional and occupational critical reaction, but they hint at the wide variety of ways to react to a film of this kind at this time (of the year).<br /><br />At the risk of trivializing my own write-up, I've come to believe there may be as many perspectives from which to view a complex movie as there are persons in the country, or perhaps the world. But that does not mean we cannot bring focus or clarity to certain elements within one.<br /><br />At any rate, to build on Ebert's thought above - whatever else may be said - it seems clear that Robert Zemeckis' holiday film THE POLAR EXPRESS is the most unique Christmastime picture to come around in quite a while.<br /><br />For the record, none of the main characters have real names: they are known, respectively, as Boy, Girl, Conductor, Know-It-All, and Loner.<br /><br />The film opens to show us Boy going to bed on Christmas Eve, appropriately minimally narrated by his older and (we must assume) grown-up voice (Tom Hank's). Having 'looked up' the North Pole before finally retiring, his attention is drawn to a loud noise and a bright light outside his bedroom window. Boy goes outside ... to see a train appear behind all the steam. The Conductor welcomes him aboard for a northerly journey that is destined to become a magical night to cherish and remember.<br /><br />As one might expect from its title, the film revolves (always in some way or other) around Santa, alas, without reference to a newborn Messiah. As Plugged-In's review has suggested, occasional danger might scare young tots; a PG rating seems more appropriate. That said, I did enjoy the train attendants' dancing routine, somewhat reminiscent of a Disney musical. I was amused to see Girl's ticket escape Boy's hand and the train, float through the air, get knocked around by various forces of nature, and land again, wherever that was. I liked that it contained peril, and Steamey and Smokey's desperate attempts to save the train from it (not to mention their other oddities). Also, that `Hobo' guy is never explained adds to the mystery the movie tries to convey. And the CGI animation looks good (though some critics have complained).<br /><br />I must confess that I have not read the 1965 book on which the film is based, so I am unequipped to make comparisons to it.<br /><br />As for the film, bits of the critical response themselves need critique. Burr, of the Globe, seems disappointed by the movie's `human' element. Sure, the animation technology used did not bring every facial detail to life, but for what was used, it is not that bad. I thought the overall portrayals (facial expressions notwithstanding) appeared to be firmly human. Also, Dargis, of the N.Y. Post, is surely wrong to say that Boy 'dreamed up' the train, as we see him pinch himself while en route, not to mention [SPOILER WARNING! rest of paragraph] a Santa-given souvenir that makes its way to the very end of the movie (literally) the morning after. The film closes us with Boy and his 'awe' or 'wonder' about Santa and the spirit of Christmas ... and the thought (despite presentable illogic) that childlike faith in Santa is in some sense real.<br /><br />For what I had expected, THE POLAR EXPRESS did not disappoint. A fine product."
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	This movie is well made with good story and lots of action.  It is good to see Snow White accept a large responsibility.
B000S5KGH4	5.0	b	Thought it was very funny and we ordered it as gifts for friends for Christmas and was a big hit and many are ordering for other friends after watching it.
B009NQKPUW	5.0	b	"Prometheus is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of the year and of the decade. Not only is it part of a phenomenal, long-lived franchise that's loved by many, but it brings to light a story that existed longer than that of the Alien; the ""Space Jockey."" What was that thing sitting in the pilot's chair of the crashed alien ship? Well, thanks to Ridley's newest film, Prometheus, you learn just what it is, and more. Prometheus is a perfect installment into the Alien franchise and brings back the awesome might and terror of space exploration; it brings many answers Alien fans have been looking for, but it also brings to light new questions as to what the universe has to offer, along the scale of godly, apocalyptic and unfathomable.<br /><br />Ridley's directing for this film was absolutely spectacular; he takes the shots that seem to be impossible for other filmmakers to get, and then adds on to that with even more heart-stopping visuals and sequences that defy imagination. The acting was superb; i think everyone already knows that the star who steals the show is Michael Fassbender as David, the new android created by Peter Weyland (played by Guy Pearce) who is very mischievous and mysterious at the same time. Noomi Rapace was great as Shaw, one of the scientists who co-discovers the ""invitation"" by the aliens, with the other scientist being played by Logan Marshall-Green as Holloway, who is very believable on screen. My favorite i would have to say is Idris Elba as Janek, the pilot of Prometheus because, when the situation gets ""hairy,"" he's one of the very few who knows what they should do; flee. The score was ominous and incredible; Marc Streitenfeld really knows what to do when it comes to film scores, with harry Gregson-Williams helping with two of the tracks. Last but not least, the visual effects; they were, not only better than Avatar, but there was not a moment when i thought it was CG. Ridley was a genius when it came to this; Alien used realistic practical effects with some CG to give the feel of sci-fi, but Prometheus did the opposite, and it works.<br /><br />All in all, Prometheus is an instant classic that falls short of being just as good as Alien, but just as good as James Cameron's Aliens. A must-see and must-own for anyone who likes sci-fi and/or is a fan of one of the best sci-fi sagas ever made"
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Well it was ok movie.  Just didnt really pull me into the movie.  I expected it was very good though Im not sure why they didnt use real little people to do the part seem odd.
B0065AVWGU	5.0	b	This movie was quite unique. I'm dissapointed in the advertisement of this movie, based on how well it was put together. I would have like to have seen it on the big screen, but the comercials and ads were appealing enough to go see. There is enough crappy movies out there, that it's not worth your 8-10 dollars a person to see.<br /><br />Everything Quintin touches, seems to be worth seeing. This movie is unlike anything you've seen so far. It's pretty wild how it really looks like a black and white comic book, but yet the characters are real. You have to see it for yourself, but you don't have to be a comic book fan to like this film, you have to be a movie fan. One who sees this film, can and will appreciate the cinematography and writing.<br /><br />Enough said, it's a must see.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is a very well done series.  It is very entertaining, especially if you have any interest in the founding fathers.  Thank you HBO!!!!
B002QZ1RS6	4.0	b	This is a fabulous workout. I want to participate so badly but holy catfish - it KILLS my knees. I saw the infomercial and knew darn well it would hurt but I had no idea there were no modifications offered, jumping/plyo is a huge part of every workout including the warmups, and he flies so quickly you don't have time to think about what else you could be doing. For the first week I just ended up doing mini squats and lightly jogging in place for most of the knee killing moves and my HR monitor still says I'm burning close to 350 calories. I have an exercise degree and am capable of modifying these myself from here forward but beware, they aren't kidding when they say you shouldn't do Insanity if you have joint problems.
B008UZ7MUI	1.0	b	Horrible! Actually I suppose the movie is good...IF I EVER GET IT! ORDERED IT OVER A MONTH AGO AND STILL HAS NOT ARRIVED! NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM A BIT PEEVED! NEVER WILL ORDER FROM AMAZON.COM AGAIN!!!!!!!
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	What more do you need?<br />And he looks great on Blu-ray!<br />And there are plenty of Special Features.<br />This shall last me to Xmas.<br />Thank you Steven, Harrison & George!!!<br />(Now, the Star Wars hexology on blu-ray PLEEEEEEEEEASE, George! )
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	This is an amazing movie, full of reality and truth. Not glorified hollywood drama. Probably my best movie purchase in a long time
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	It was really good and so was the price.  This DVD had extras that I didn't expect but was glad to see it.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	My family (2 girls, 1 boy, myself, and my wife) love this film.  Product was in excellent condition.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Lets be honest here, the people who rated, we'll be nice and say less than 3 stars, have no taste what so ever. Sure True Blood is not the same as the books but lets think about this, the books are all in Sookie's POV therefore if the show just followed Sookie and no one else it would surely be a bore. This is a great show and it's very well done for a vampire series, especially after having seen Twilight, blech! I've read all the books and I eagerly await the new one coming out and I still find True Blood fantastic! I like the changes made and I like the books.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	Let me just say, this works JUST FINE on my PS3. Not a long load time, maybe a minute for the disc. Then after, VERY fast.<br /><br />Iron Man the movie, is a fun ride. I really liked re-watching it again on Blu Ray. It looks and sounds AMAZING.<br /><br />The 2nd disc is FULL of hours of making of features. This is how DVD special features should be made. I was very impressed and I buy all my DVD's in 2 disc just for special features and Iron Man doesn't disappoint.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	I was extremely pleased with the way everything turned out.<br />I received the product in time and it was in pretty good shape when I received it.  I would definately recommend the company who sent this to me.  Thank you so much!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"It's fun to scroll through Amazon's ""recommendations"" for me, though spooky how well the ghost in their machine understands me.<br /><br />I didn't think the Coens could make a more perfect film than ""Fargo"" but I've watched ""No Country"" more times since its release than ""Fargo"" which is ten years older. I think I'll watch it again tonight, Friendo.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones has been in a few dogs but not many, and not lately.<br /><br />Casting is as much of an art as acting.<br /><br />Watch these films back to back:<br /><br />""No Country for Old Men""<br />""In the Valley of Elah""<br />""The Client""<br />""Monster"""
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	"I have a four yr old little boy who loves all kinds of trucks and cars.  He could give you the names of all his vehicles long before he could identify his colors.  So when we saw the movie trailers for ""Cars"" on the computer, I knew that we needed to get this one.  As one of his Christmas gifts it is quickly becoming his new, all-time favorite.  It takes the self-centered racing car, Lightning McQueen and side-tracks him in a sleepy old town that the interstate by-passed.  During his week of community service, he makes friends and finds out that there is more to life than living in the fast lane.  It is a wonderful movie and well worth watching it over and over as four year olds love to do."
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	This movie is amazing, there's no need for tons of speeches or explanations, every scenes are perfectely directed, even if the characters are not the brightest men we met, there's no silly actions or moves, they all interact cleverly in this world. Almost without music, they create an atmosphere that haunts you till the end. The Blu Ray is almost perfect, the picture is great and the PCM, Oh Man, is gorgeous, you hear the wind like never before, the gunshots penetrate your ears and the voice of Tommy Lee Jones is gorgeous.
B009NQKPUW	4.0	b	"I read the critics and almost didn't watch this movie. The current trend of bashing and trolling everything as being less than perfect realLy effects the comments here unfortunatly.  They are crying about the movie not being ""perfect"" or up to their ""fanboy imagination"" ""standards""...weak. GRAB SOME POPCORN AND DIM THE LIGHTS... this movie is worth your time. And just like in life, ignore the obnoxious comments from the loud and the few."
B001G2MB2G	1.0	b	I am a die-hard Harry Potter fan, but have to say this movie was a HUGE disappointment.  The scenes were short and choppy.  It felt almost like a poorly constructed Cliff Notes version from someone who hadn't read the books all the way through.  I recognize that it was a long book to condense into a movie, but the movie bounces from scene to scene without taking the time to develope relationships between the characters, or even the characters themselves.  Not even Emma/Hermione's usually superior acting has a chance to shine through the limits imposed on her by a fragmented script.<br /><br />I would give the previous movies a 5, 5, 5, 4.  I have not always agreed with the decissions the director made with what he cut.  For example, I missed Dursleys and Dobby in the 4th movie, but those difficult decissions on the part of the director and screenwriter allowed for the scenes that remained to be fleshed out in a meaningfull way and relationships to be developed in a way that was fufilling to the viewer and characters.  The harsh reality that the director and screenwriter of Order of the Phoenix failed to grasp is that you simply can't include everything without making a longer movie (which is what I would vote for and pay extra to see - it is possible, think of the Lord of the Rings trilolgy).<br /><br />For example, what is the point of introducing Tonks to see her grump at Moody for 2 seconds, and see her change her nose.  She wasn't even given the opportunity to show her dueling skills in the ministry (she is only on the screen a few seconds).  Why bring Lupin back for the scant couple minutes of screen time he gets?  It is just disjointed and ultimately unsatisfying.We do not feel the pain at the loss of Sirius the way the reader did with the book because the director does not give their relationship the screen time it needs.  Indeed, it would have been an incredibly difficult movie to follow or even understand for someone who has not read the book at least once, and probably twice.<br /><br />A serious disappointment.
B001OHS8BQ	4.0	b	If you are a believer in God and heterosexual marriage simultaneously, this movie has a beautiful message. It is for a very specific audience. Kirk Cameron does a great job at revealing how a man's faith can save not only his marriage but his soul. Love love this film. So glad I own it. So worth discussing afterward with your mate and friends who strongly uphold faith based marriage.
B004P9FAKW	3.0	b	Let me first say I'm a big Harry Potter fan, and this DVD is worth the money if you're a fan and like the extras. But, don't say this is a great movie because it's not; it's simple, with a weak script, and lots of overacting. The Director changed and it's really noticeable, the script misses many important themes and moments from the book, and chooses to emphasize some more subtle and honestly more boring aspects of the story, ie: walking in the hall, some dialog, and cut aways; there's just too much transition here. If the editor did his job better the movie would've been 20 minutes shorter and flowed better. The director tried to make up for a bad script with a good ending and he succeeded. That's why I gave three stars. I don't think Harry came out as a very sympathetic character, but this wasn't my favorite book either.
B001KEGR8Y	1.0	b	This guy is not funny at all but for some reason people love him. I'm not saying don't watch it, because maybe your one of those people with no sense of humor that likes this kind of stuff. If you think Larry the Cable Guy or Rob Schneider is funny, then you might like this guy
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	Should you find yourself strapped to a chair, immobile, without a remote to turn off this movie, then you have no choice.  Take your punishment.  A story of a crazy jackass just shooting at everyone and everything, even a bird. Totally senseless.  That's how the movie depicts that this country is no place for old men.  This movie is a waste of time and I refuse to spend any more time writing about it.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	This movie is so funny!My favorite characters are Mater, Lighting Mcqueen, sally and Filmore.  If you didn't see this movie in theaters then you must rent this or buy it on dvd.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	"I have completed the full set of DVDs once now and I'm 2 weeks into the second time through.  It will leave you with sore burning muscles at all times if you follow the schedule.  Not that it's a bad thing, that's what it's supposed to do.<br /><br />Some of the moves in the videos are virtually impossible especially for a person who is not already in great shape.  The people in the videos are already in great shape and they can't keep up, so I don't feel too bad about it.  You have people who run marathons and are aerobics/spinning instructors in the classes following along and they fail at it all the time.<br /><br />There are a few points in the video where he says the wrong thing, but it's not a big deal after you do it a few times, you know what he means.<br /><br />It's going to be a long time before I can go from doing a pushup to jumping up from the bottom of the pushup and standing up straight all in one move.  I have a hard enough time with regular pushups, so that's pretty much what I do in those sections.<br /><br />Also, in the ""Max"" videos there is a move where you are supposed to be down on your hands and feet, kinda like a downward dog, then jump forward almost to a handstand while swinging your legs side to side.  Yeah... I can't do that.  I would like to not break my neck while working out.  I'll do some nice ""ski abs"" right there while you guys have fun.<br /><br />That's what you have to remember while doing these videos though.  He repeats over and over, do this at your own pace.  So, do it at your own pace.  If there is something you physically can't do for whatever reason, you can figure out a similar substitute exercise to do there.<br /><br />Oh, and when he talks about the ""recovery"" day like it's going to be easy... it's lies!  It's a day of slow squats and lunges that will destroy your leg muscles.  I'm always more sore after the recovery day than any other workout.<br /><br />Also, the girls in the video are hot!  Ariel is my personal favorite.  She's just beautiful and she does all the moves right.  She changes her hair color daily (blonde is the best).  And Tonya is cute.  And the girl who spits on the floor, don't remember her name right now, but she's hot.  I like her attitude (""I feel like $#!7!"").  And all of the other girls too actually.<br /><br />And if anything goes wrong, it's probably Josh's fault."
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	"Prepare to be shocked and surprised by this series in every way. Alan Ball fans, forget his prior writing or you will be dismayed. True Blood is a perverse,tongue-in-cheek portrayal of, not only southern culture, but of vampire movies and literature.  Picture David Lynch's unsophisticated and melodramatic characters from ""Wild at Heart"" to get the flavor of the southern culture in this picture.<br /><br />Blood, sex and perverse aggression characterizes this series. In the first episode we learnt that vampires have only recently been openly recognized due to the manufacture of a synthetic blood drink,True Blood, that releases vampires from the necessity to prey upon humans to survive. The main character, strangely named ""Sookie Stackhouse"" (""Sookie"" with a southern accent sounds almost like ""suckie"")works at a bar set in a dark southern forest. Sookie is able to read people's minds, which causes her to interact strangely as she strives to interact while listening to what people are thinking all around her. One of her customers thinks that the rumors that Sookie is ""retarded"" must be true because of her vague and distracted manner.<br /><br />Then a vampire, Bill, enters the bar. Most of the clientele of the bar is hostile towards him but Sookie is strangely excited and welcoming though she must admit to him they do not carry True Blood. After the bar closes, the vampire is mugged by one of the bar's redneck clientele, Rattray, played by James Parks who previosly portrayed a vampire in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In this series he plays a human vampire who is addicted to the high from drinking vampire blood.<br /><br />When Sookie leaves the bar she senses something is wrong and grabs a large chain coiled up in the back of a pick-up truck. She comes upon Rattray draining her new vampire friend Bill of his blood. Bill has been made helpless by being draped with silver chains by Rattray's female friend. Sookie beats up Rattray with the chain,nearly strangling him with it (the vampire he portrayed in Buffy was strangled) and releases vampire Bill. Sookie is immediately infatuated with Bill and fascinated that he cannot read her mind.<br /><br />The vampires in True Blood are violent, selfishly perverse and scornful of humans. Despite the fact that they are lobbying for equal rights with humans, their behavior is distinctly inhuman--thought the humans are no better. Sookie's brother is a young man who is constantly in trouble due to his poor judgement and excessive libido. There are frequent shots of him having sex and he rides his partners like he is astride a mechanical bronco.  A series of murders plagues the town and Sookie's brother and Bill the vampire are both prime suspects.<br /><br />This series centers around the romance between Sookie and Bill the vampire, the resulting unwanted attention she receives from both her human community and the vampire community as a result, the mystery of the serial murders, and the personal affairs of Sookie's brother and best friend.<br /><br />Both Anna Paquin, as Sookie, and Stephen Moyer, as Bill are a bit stilted in their roles. Paquin's interpretation of Sookie is as a shallow and brittle ingenue without much intelligence but fairly gutsy--she prances around in pigtails but then blithely nearly beats someone to death with a chain. Vampire Bill is only intermittently attractive and often seems ponderous and wooden-shades of Barnabas Collin's? It is hard to tell if these portrayals are purposeful or just representative of the best these actors have to offer. The supporting cast is much more vital and interesting, particularly Rutina Wesley, as best friend Tara, Nelson Ellis as a cross-dressing entrepreneur, and Michael Raymond-James as the token Cajun. William Sanderson is strangely lack-luster in his role as the sheriff--for such a seasoned and fluid actor this must have been a choice. The question is why? To further the strange atmosphere of this story?<br /><br />Despite the perplexing and cock-eyed strangeness of the characterizations and story, this eccentric and peculiar series grew on me. I was interested to find out the ending and will definitely watch season two. I needed to get over the seemingly unsophisticated script that seemed way out of character for Alan Ball in order to enjoy the torrid and sordid world of True Blood. Provisionally recommended!"
B0098VYCCE	3.0	b	Charlize Theron is perfect in this role. She made the movie. The scenery was awesome. The Black Forest was cool and creepy and the Dwarfs were good as well as the creatures and special effects in this movie. I personally won't buy this unless i can get it used for a few bucks. It was a good movie but lacked something in my opinion. It just wasn't the block buster i had hoped for.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	If you plan on buying or watching Fireproof then it is best to know that this movie is all about the message and not about the cinematography or acting.  Fireproof is a movie dedicated to helping couples find the love back in their relationship.  The true basis of this film is that no matter how hard you try another person no matter how much you love them will not fill the void entirely.  The movie is about finding Christ and letting him love you and in return you can love others with more energy and deeper than you could have before.<br /><br />It is a great movie to watch whether you are in a relationship or not.  If people are able to learn the lesson of this movie before entering a relationship then that will only help your life.  The movie's acting is a bit corny but that should be somewhat expected.  If you can get past that then I believe that everyone will take something away from this movie.
B001684L0A	5.0	b	This is an excellent acount of what it took to gain the rights which all of us enjoy under our Constitution.  It should teach us to never take these rights for granted, particularly now when totalitarism is trying to take over all around the globe; where the rights of the individual are under attack, even in our own great country the United States of America.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	It's funny. I am late coming to this movie because I was afraid it would be too intense for my child, who just turned 3. I have yet to let him watch Nemo. Also, I am doing everything I can to discourage NASCAR viewer ship in my household. (Being a Southerner, you choose between two classes - Thoroughbreds or stock cars.)<br /><br />At last, I gave in. My son loves the cars and although he had not asked for the movie, my partner and I needed a break from Thomas, so I bought the widescreen version of this movie.<br /><br />The first thing I realized was that this is the same story as Doc Hollywood. Now, I happen to be a sap and I loved Doc Hollywood, but I was afraid it might be a too-familiar theme to keep my interest. Suffice it to say, I did not pause the movie one time from start to end.<br /><br />Some say it does not have enough drama, but I am so glad no one has to die in this one, especially the Mom - and in a very loud and violent way - such as with Nemo. (I am still wondering whether Walt Disney ever got therapy for his Mother issues. Between the Mothers dying and the rest of the older women being witches - well...)<br /><br />The characters are amazingly well-developed, remarkably loveable and incredibly designed. The casting was perfect and the tons of little jokes and spoofs will keep us watching this for a long time - if for nothing else than to watch for the jokes we missed.<br /><br />We may have enjoyed it more than he did, but I know he will watch it many times in the months to come.<br /><br />Oh - and for those who didn't have at least one little tear - cut back on your Prozac.
B0006989TE	4.0	b	The Village begins with the premise that the village Covington lays in the middle of a forest to where to no roads lead as it is isolated by &quot;Those We Do Not Speak Of&quot; that live in the woods around Covington. The people of Covington have solemnly sworn a pact with &quot;Those We Do Not Speak Of&quot; that the humans will not enter the woods and &quot;Those We Do Not Speak Of&quot; will not enter the village. The people in Covington do not have appropriate medical care as they know there are medicines in the towns beyond the woods. A young man Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) requests to enter the woods and get the medicine, but his request is denied. One day Lucius enters the fringe of the woods, and he is seen by one of &quot;Those We Do Not Speak Of&quot;, and the following evening they enter the town to warn the people about entering the woods.<br /><br /> If you have seen any of M. Night Shyamalan's other films you are aware that he is plot twister and might change the whole concept of the film. This is no exception to the Shyamalan rule as the film will give some interesting ideas of how &quot;Those We Do Not Speak Of&quot; came about. It might indulge the audience to ponder some ideas from Thomas Moore and other sociopolitical aspects as it could affect the outcome of the film. Many viewers who went to see it might have been affected by the great media hype that has surrounded the film as it could not have been avoided if one traffics the internet or watches television. In the end, The Village offers a pretty good cinematic event, if the audience lets down their guard and lets the film tell the story as the audience ponders the &quot;why's?'
B007FQDPL8	4.0	b	Season 1 of True Blood left me wanting more.  Even though the directors deviated from the book, it works.  The sex was too much and sometimes overshadowed the story line. The acting is great and the introduction of new characters is aways exciting.<br /><br />I am looking forward to buying Season 2.
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	The books are way better....This is just an excuse to show nudity and use foul language on the big screen.<br />I'm no prude but this sucks (excuse the pun!)<br /><br />My friend loan it to me to view and I did not care for it.<br /><br />Not worth the money....
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	"I was very impressed with this item and would buy from this seller again and again. I was skeptical getting something that was ""new"" so cheap, but it came sealed packaging and all!"
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	All I can say about this series is I am shocked that I got hooked on to it. Really when I heard this was a vampire series I was skeptical because of twilight but this series gave me a whole new perspective because of its content. In other words if you are worried about not liking this series because of Twilight it is completely different. It is an adult version of Twilight. Lots of sex, violence, action and other things what else can you ask for. I have to say one thing about this TV show is that it leaves you on the edge of your seat.  That is all you can ask for a TV series is it making you want to  come back next week for more. Another advantage of this series is it is really hard to read. When you see the end of the season or the last episode it will really surprise you how everything turns out. Also the way the characters are layed out in this season are perfect. It seems like anyone could identify with one of the characters in this series. You could find one you love and one that you hate. That is key for any movie or TV series if you are able to identify with one or more of the characters you know you got something going for you. Let me say this, there are so many twists and turns in this season alone that it is not predictable and that is a good thing. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and you don't have to worry this is nothing from twilight from what I hear. It is more mature and something that everyone can enjoy if they give it a chance. Easily a must have DVD set and 5/5 stars for me.
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	I loved this movie.  Great imagination, well crafted and believable, I find it money well spent for entertainment.  Great service from Amazon.
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	I LOVE the movie, I love the books, and amazon's service is great as usual. The only question/complaint I have is the really really small wide-screen format of the 2 disc special. I thought wide-screen meant the picture has the full width and not the whole height, but my picture on my laptop is cut off from all four sides. I dont really know if there is something I can do to change this, if there is please let me know!!!<br />other than that, fantastic movie!!
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	Same as other review. Love Harry Potter movies and this one is great as are the others. Can't wait for the final two movies.
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	"...That is, my son would have loved this when he was a kid.  And let's face it, this film seems mostly made with little boys in mind - bright, shiny cars and trucks racing along like so many HotWheels.  The visuals were stunning, the humorous caricatures very droll and amusing.  The story is basically a hot-shot Nascar-like celebrity learning about life and humility in a small town, presumably in the California outback.  However - and this is a personal ""however"" - I must be too old for envisioning a world where the dominant (indeed, only) lifeform is the car.  Ford Prefect made that same mistake in ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".  In Disney's 1952 original car film, ""Susi the Little Coupe"" (who looked as if she would have fit into this movie just fine) there were humans around in background roles, and I think a human audience would have been less unsettling than an audience full of cars.  But maybe I am just being picky."
B008UZ7MUI	4.0	b	I wouldn't dream of not seeing this as Harry Potter, whether in print, audio or film, has been a most wonderful experience for me.  However, I did wonder after seeing this movie, whether it had been a mistake to divide the last book into two parts. This is because the pace is slower than either the novel or the other six movies.  No one ever divided the other movies into two parts, however.  This made the other movies not waste a second whereas in this one the pace is a bit more leisurely.<br /><br />That being said, this otherwise brings the novel faithfully to life.  Harry, Hermione and Ron are on the run as they hunt for the horcruxes to destroy Lord Voldemort.  There is an added wrinkle they learn though when they hear the story of the Deadly Hallows from Luna's father and Hermione.  This added wrinkle is told visually with what may be puppets and is the most visually arresting part of the movie.  Whoever did this sequence did an incredible job.  It is a fabulous piece of art and storytelling.<br /><br />Lord Voldemort as played by Ralph Fienne is absolutely magnificent.  Every time he is onscreen, the story is just wonderful. The makeup and prostheses used on him also recreate the oddly disfigured creature he became when he returned to the world.<br /><br />If the second part is extremely well done, then the two parts, when viewed together, may end up being a 5 star experience.  As it is, one is left a bit unsatisfied at the odd truncation point of this seventh film, a part one rather than a whole film.
B007FQDPL8	1.0	b	True Blood spends too much time in nudity and the obscene and not enough time developing a story.  The death scences of a Vampires are gross when they turn into a mess of blood.  The characters are hard to believe and act like idots most of the time. The love Sookie Stackhouse is supposed to feel for Bill the Vampire is lacking,you don't feel the magic between them.  Their facial expressions don't even show a deeping love.  The secondary characters are a drag on the show i.e., sheriff etc, very poor activng or directing, whichever. Emotion is entirely missing in the acting for the entire cast.  It is definitely not one that I would considering purchasing or rewatching beyond the HBO initial series. Give it One * Star.  After seeing Moonlight, True Blood is a belly flop,  At least HBO didn't dump the audience that enjoys this show like CBS did Moonlight or Lifetime did Blood Ties.
B002QZ1RS6	1.0	b	Thank you all for your feedback about dvds not working. I found these comments on all Beachbody Products. So, I have decided against the purchase & will look for other products. Again thanks save me $150!!!
B0098VYCCE	2.0	b	"Look, I get it. Everyone wants to do a ""New Vision"" of a classic tale. I tend to cut stories like these a lot of slack, because imagination should be rewarded, and often is rewarding to experience. Not in this case, though.<br /><br />The best that can be said for this movie is that I don't feel like I wasted my time having watched it. It was mildly entertaining... every once in awhile. The main problem I had was that the story takes very broad strokes and seems to centralize on explaining plot points that do little to enrich the viewers experience and do almost nothing with the points that would have added depth to the tale. It also had at least an hour of film that rightly should have been excluded since it did nothing but bog the story down.<br /><br />However, the weakness in the story could have been salvaged if Kristen Stewart hadn't been cast in the lead. Now, don't get me wrong: I think she's a wonderful actress. She put on a VERY good performance in ""Adventureland"". Granted, the movie really kinda sucked, but her role was very convincingly played, and she gets credit in my book for that. However, Kristen needs to play to her strengths... which, ironically, is her ability to portray a vulnerable and weak character. Hated ""Twilight"" and the franchise it spawned, but after having read the first book, I have to hand it to her: She played the part exceedingly well. Charlize Theron can portray the full gamut, from ultra strong to pityingly weak, but Kristen either doesn't have the chops or hasn't tapped into that part of her personality in order to give a convincing performance. The Snow White in this movie needed to run the range along with Theron, and Kristen was not up to the task, and the movie suffered as a result.<br /><br />I debated on giving it 1 star instead of 2, and in the end I decided that 2 stars was more fair. It was a decent attempt, and the other performances, while not Oscar worthy, were at least par for the course (Except Sam Spruell: That dude should never be given more than two lines in ANY movie, and no line over 5 syllables). The storytelling was meandering even at the best of times, and no one seemed to really WANT to be there, but the cinematography was very well done, a few new elements to the classic tale were well received, and while this is not going to be on my Christmas bluray list, I can appriciate the movie for what it truly is: A fair attempt at an original vision of a classic tale."
B001684L0A	5.0	b	The entire cast is incredible.  A good historical film adaptation - as far as they usually go (pathetic).  Historical assumptions have to be made in many areas and if they are off we can't know; though the film is made so well that you could hardly care in the moments when you're watching it.  Excellent cinematography, as well.  I purchased the DVDs because I missed the beginning of the HBO viewing and but caught the scene in which Adams has an audience with George III.  It's a rediculously good scene and it's still my favorite after watching the whole mini-series.  Watch with a history-loving friend, and enjoy.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	I don't know alot about this book yet I haven't read it. Bought for my wife. She seems happy with it. She couldn't buy it herself because she won't learn to use the computer. The book was as describe by the seller.<br />Shipped fast.  Thanks!!
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Best documentary since 'Super Size Me'. Ben Stein does a great job with what is a very divisive issue.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	My husband and I saw so much of each other in the movie...the frustrations of the past...the damage that was done...but the message that such damage CAN be overcome through prayer and a renewed commitment to each other came at a pivitol point in our relationship.  I think every married couple ought to watch this movie.
B008UZ7MUI	3.0	b	The digital copy on this set has expired.  However, at the price it was at as of this writing, its still a better deal than buying the DVD and blu-ray separately, if you want to own both.  This set is the same price right now as the blu-ray alone, so its nice to have the extra dvd to be able to play in my car where we don't have blu-ray.
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I already watch the show.>I find it to be very entertaining and some what addicting.  I was very pleased with the price on this item.  For this Item, I can honestly say that there is nothing that I would have liked to know before making my purchase.
B001G2MB2G	5.0	b	Well I haven't actually received the movie yet, but I saw it in the theater and it is just great!
B00447G29S	5.0	b	"The answer to the question...""When will this be out on dvd?"" is found in the press release.....the answer is ""November 2005"".  NATURALLY JUST IN TIME FOR THE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING SEASON."
B009NQKPUW	2.0	b	"This review is for the movie itself, not for the actual DVD/Blu-ray packaging of the product.<br /><br />When I heard that this movie was being released, I was excited.  So excited, that I actually avoided all reviews/previews/etc. so that when I saw it, on opening night no less, I could see it with my own eyes and not through the filter of other's opinions.<br /><br />Well, lets start with the good; this movie has great production values. The cinematography, the special effects, the acting, all good. I really liked Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and even Charlize Theron (whom I usually don't like) in this movie.  I also like Logan Marshall-Green as the boyfriend, as he struggles to make his parts in this script seem believable.<br /><br />The problem is the script. This movie is flawed in basic character action and motivation. It looks really good, but it doesn't make sense.  It's kinda like a music video or a dream sequence. There's just no reason for the characters to act the way they do in the movie. All actions are done in a forced, very artificial way to advance a bone-headed plot. The geologist/mapping expert gets lost. Someone takes off their helmet just because there's oxygen in the atmosphere. A biologist is scared of a dead body, then tries to pet an obviously hostile space snake.<br /><br />It's not just the human characters, either, there's no reason for the Engineers to do what they do in the movie. Still, the ""monster"" going around eating/impregnating/infecting people makes more sense than a woman not realizing she should get out of the way of a massive moving object about to squish her.<br /><br />If you're looking for ""hard-science"" sci-fi, look elsewhere. Black goo as a evolution accelerant is really the least of the scientific problems with this movie. You've got corporate-owned light-speed vehicles in only a century? In real life, we can't even fund the space shuttle!<br /><br />And then there are the subtle, overall themes of the movie. Yes, I've read the Dec. 31, ""space-jesus"" explanations of the movie; again, it's forced, and it still doesn't fit. And high-brow ideas don't make up for the deep flaws elsewhere.<br /><br />Overall, there are just too many holes in this movie, and not just the kind left on purpose for a sequel, or even the parts cut out like the TED speech. This was a very expensive disappointment. This movie is worth renting for the acting and visual effects, perhaps worth buying on sale, but not worth buying or paying full price in the theaters."
B00447G29S	4.0	b	I love this movie. Seeing it in 3D only makes it better. I was upset to find out not a month after buying it that Best Buy has it brand new for $20 (I paid $26). Great movie no matter the cost.
B009NQKPUW	1.0	b	"Your reaction to this movie will depend on the type of viewer you are. If all you need is to be entertained you won't be sorry: There's spaceships! Alien races! Thrills, mysteries and action! By golly, you can watch it in 3D AND IMAX!!<br /><br />If you're any kind of Sci-Fi fan you will leave scratching your head, first wondering about the lack of narrative, then asking yourself why you even bothered to go, rent or buy this in the first place. Me? Ridley Scott! Result? Sheesh...<br /><br />- Don't read beyond this if you haven't watched it -<br /><br />The plot is just one series of incoherences, it could have been called ""Amateurs in space"". Let's take a super intelligent android so he can casually stab us in the back! Let's spend gazillions of dollars and travel bazillions of miles only to take a couple of doofus to mess about! It's not like they're going to get lost, I mean they have this cool mapping technology, right? Oh, they did? But they won't inevitably get eaten or beaten, right? Honestly, I was ready to leave by that point.<br /><br />I think someone could take the scenes from this movie and make a more intelligent narrative: Is it some sort of cult? Are they mortal enemies? Who came first? Have these beings evolved so much they are in mortal danger from their own boredom? The makers of this film obviously want us to watch the sequel, but guess what, I'd have a better time speculating with friends than watching another movie about space made by amateurs. I would suggest we all stop subsidizing mediocrity."
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	In this movie everyone but Mark Wahlberg is shot in the face, before this an intricate game of cat and mouse takes place where two people are half-cat half-mouse creatures on the hunt and hunted by each other. An excellent flick to bring a date to. I give it an A-.
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	"Got this for a friend whos marriage is failing. Sat with her and watched this, she had tears at the end and ran to get her husband and was saying ""this is us, this movie is us and we've gotta try"" and they went to their room to talk. So far, they are working on their marriage again. Its excellent and should be followed with The Lovedare book."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This guy is absolutely HILARIOUS.  I suggest that everybody and ANYBODY should by this DVD.
B008M4HANQ	5.0	b	Really enjoyed this version of Snow White, it was very easy to get caught up in the story,plus a visually beautiful film.
B0098VYCCE	5.0	b	We liked this movie. It was entertaining and had quite the spin from the original Snow White that we grew up with.  A few scenes which we though were going to be predictable were a pleasant surprise.  There was even a bit of comedy in this movie.  It is fairly dark, so not for kids, but a good movie.  We would recommend it.
B0006989TE	5.0	b	Not a horror film, not for those who are looking for chills, but a truly beautiful tale of love and devotion, set against a background of fear.
B002QZ1RS6	5.0	b	The shipment arrived one day ahead of schedule. I was not expecting the bonus two DVDs that were included on follow up programs. Look forward to completing this program! Thanks Again
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This is the funniest Dunham DVD to date.  You can watch it time and time again.  Can't wait for the next one to come out....
B0006989TE	3.0	b	Watching Ebert & Roeper discuss this movie before I saw it was a good idea for me.  Ebert hated it, Roeper loved it.  Roeper said that if you go into the theatre, trying to guess and figure things out, you'll be sorely disappointed. But if you go in with the attitude to just watch it for what it is you'll enjoy it. I agree with him.  I did enjoy this movie.  Yes, some things were farfetched but the cinematography was beautiful, as well as the acting.  I did think it was strange that even though this is supposed to take place in what, the 18th or 19th century, the english seemed to be a little off.  There is a reason for this later on.  A few more hints were given throughout the movie but try not to guess too much.
B002VRZEYM	5.0	b	On a recent roadtrip to California, we were on Interstate 5 and passed an area of feedlots near Stockton - the odor was unbelievable for miles before and after! Some of what we saw in the film is stuff we may have heard about, but to have it all put together coherently brings the information home, right to where we can see the results on our plates and in our refrigerator and cupboards(and in the nostrils of those unlucky enough to work or live near these giant feedlots!) It was mind-boggling and disturbing to really realize what keeps our food so cheap (relative to Europe or Japan or some other nations,) so disturbing we couldn't even watch the whole film in one sitting!<br />Food, INC, should be required viewing for everyone. Americans must think about what we are allowing to be done to us, our bodies, our country. There are so many questions the film stirs up; Why are the corn farms still being subsidized by taxpayers? Why is corn ethanol being promoted by the government when there are more efficient plants(sugarcane,sugarbeets,some grasses, etc)that can be used to make ethanol, and on and on. . .?
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	I love this show. Fullstop. Without reservation. I have read all the Sookie Stackhouse books and enjoyed them greatly. Alan Ball's interpretation doesn't disappoint at all. Far from it. He's provided another way to really enjoy a rollicking and very adult story. The show diverges from the books in some ways yet remains true in theme and flavour. I like all the changes (from Harris' books) that Ball has written into the two series. They add texture and flavour in spades. This HBO series is fresh, brave, sexy, outrageous and sheer fun. Unique in concept. I rank it alongside Dexter, Weeds, the Sopranos.<br /><br />Those who like their vampire stories mild and bloodless may not enjoy this. This is not Twilight, nor the easily digested Buffy or Angel. True Blood is a raunchy and novel tale beautifully acted by the cast members main and minor. Those who cast the characters deserve immense kudos. I couldn't fault their choices.<br /><br />The episode intro is brilliant and never gets boring - both the music and the pastiche of well-chosen imagery. Just as good as the Sopranos intro and that is a show-stopper.<br /><br />I've bought the series and will buy the second. And the third which I hear HBO will be delivering to us next year.<br /><br />Thank you, Alan Ball and HBO!
B0090XJJT6	5.0	b	I am not a fan of DiCaprio and i am normally not into this sort of movie. But this was excellent! I am just astonished that anyone could give this movie a bad rating. For once i was actually surprised by some things in this film but i can't say more or it may ruin it. If you want a flick to get engrossed in, grab some popcorn and settle in , this is the film you have been waiting for.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"Everyone seems to forget the Indiana Jones movies are pulp movies in the same way the Flash Gordon movies were, the same as the James Bond movies and Star Wars movies are.  They are ""the continuing adventures of..."" types of movies.  While this is not the best of the Indy movies, I personally think everyone was expecting a remake if Raiders of the Lost Ark.  In the spirit of the type of movie this is, it is a great movie.  Is it a great 'Indiana Jones' movie?  No.  I do like it better than 'Temple of Doom', but less than 'Last Crusade.'  Yes, 'Raiders' is the archetype for all Indy movies, but to expect the first Indy movie in 2 decades to rehash what has already come is stupid.  This is pulp fiction in its truest form, like (as I stated) James Bond.  It has its good moments, as well as its bad.  Come on, you cannot say you didn't like seeing Marion again and the banter between her and Indy.  If you look at the scenes between Karen Allen and Harrison Ford, it is hard to believe twenty plus years have passed since they have been on camera together.  So, my humble opinion, in the spirit of ""in the continuing adventures of Indiana Jones"" this is a good movie, as a stand alone in the franchise, not the best but not the worst."
B001IA2PTK	5.0	b	Honestly, I was dragged to this film.  So, how surprised was I that I loved it.  I was concerned about Ford's age and how he would play the character of Jones.  They found the perfect balance in the film for him.<br />The movie was filled with action and humor like the first.  Le Bouef was a great attribute and will hopefully continue on with the films.
B001IA2PTK	4.0	b	"Indiana Jones leaps into the fifties and captures every meaningful bit of life during that era.  Aging only slightly less than his onscreen character, Harrison Ford seems every bit fit and spry as the time-lapse could possibly find him.  At his side is a new adventurer, Henry ""Mutt"" Williams (Shia LaBeof), as likely as any successor to fill his shoes as the next matinee idol.  Noting Shia's screen presence in everything from `Transformers' to `Disturbia,' it has already happened.<br /><br />Still reinventing the tricks from the serial adventures of old, Director Spielberg and Executive Producer Lucas have teamed up to dazzle us once again.  This time the ""Red Scare"" is given a `<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792838289"">The Manchurian Candidate</a>' balance by offering an unvarnished Soviet menace matched by an overzealous FBI investigating Professor Jones' and his university.<br /><br />Set in Nevada in 1957, Jones and his sidekick ""Mack"" (Ray Winstone) defend a military facility being overtaken by the Soviets in the desert.  At the compounds' storage warehouse, we find out early that ""cliffhanger"" is going to be as potent as any Jones has taken so far.  Leading the enemy is Col. Irina Spalko (played expertly by a steely cold Kate Blanchett, who has truly earned her own gold by her multi-faceted acting ability).  Once Indiana escapes, he finds himself on a model test city that's about to be detonated by a test atom bomb.  An asset of quietly cheeky satire, we see him going across a linoleum kitchen floor until he finds a ""model"" (as in mannequin) family in the living room.<br /><br />Once he regroups, he runs into leather-jacketed motorcycle Mutt who leads him to find Jones' lost colleague Harold Oxley (John Hurt) who has been kidnapped along with Mutt's mother down in the Amazon in a lost Mayan city of gold.  This time instead of a lost ark or a lost holy grail, Indiana and his new friend head to South America in search of the loved ones along with a precious artifact in the ""crystal skull"".  Here they sort out clues and translate an ancient language to find the lost treasure before the Soviets can.<br /><br />I can't help but make comparisons to recent DVD release '<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YABYPQ"">National Treasure 2 - Book of Secrets (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>'.  Both sport likable characters and able actors, and both stories are about deciphering clues that bring both entourages to a lost city of gold.  What wins out in this adventure is the suspense and entertainment:  The danger is more immediate; the timing is nearly flawless; and the jokes are far more formidable.  What separates 'NT2' from '...The Crystal Skull' is that this one is more stimulating with peril and revelations that are surprising; the other is more breezy and only lightly entertaining. Between David Koepp's screenplay, the right touches by Spielberg and Lucas, Michael Kahn's excellent editing, and, of course, the right feel by John Williams, this film makes a world of difference."
B001KEGR8Y	4.0	b	Absolutely loved this video!  It's one of his earlier releases, so Achmed is NOT part of the line-up of puppets.  We've since viewed his newer ones and loved all of them.
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	Received the movie when expected in excellent condition.  The CD played fine with no problems.  Excellent buying experience and loved the movie!
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	The powerful novels of Cormac McCarthy may lend themselves to interpretation on film and No Country for Old Men has been successfully translated by the Coen brothers and is a superb work of art in its own right. In an interview in a recent magazine, McCarthy indicated he was pleased with the translation of his novel into a film, saying that the film captured the novel.  The direct, bleak, no frills dialogue that is a characteristic of McCarthy's novels is captured in the dialogue in the film.  Both the novel and the film are disturbing, not only for violent content but also for the philosophical underpinning of the novel and film. As the literary critic Harold Bloom notes, the violence in McCarthy's work is not gratuitous, but plays and essential role in the underlying message and theme of the work. I hope to focus on this underlying philosophy in this review.<br />The story is that of an everyman, a self contained competent American male against forces that are overpowering even for his rugged native ingenuity. Llewelyn Moss, played superbly by Josh Brolin, discovers where a drug deal gone bad has left all parties (both men an dogs) dead on the field, with neither the money or the drugs taken away. He finds 2 million dollars in payoff money and takes it. However, he violates a basic premise, often explored in the novels of John Bowles, that he should follow his instincts and never second guess himself in such a risky situation. Llewelyn is troubled by the cry of a dying Mexican drug dealer for water and so he fills up an empty milk jug and goes back to the scene of the crimes to give he man water. What a mistake this is and what a price he pays.  He is soon pursued by a paid killer, Chigurh, played perfectly by Javier Bardem. He sends his wife to his mother-in-law's home and tries to escape the, and embarks on an escape, leaving his wife Carla (Kelly Macdonald) to escape the pursuit of Chigurh.  Because of the string of killings, Chigurh is being tracked by the local sheriff, played by Tommy Lee Jones. The sheriff becomes somewhat of a narrator and commentator upon the events as they unfold. Chigurh is also followed by a hitman, played by Woody Harrelson, who works for one of the criminal parties left empty handed after the desert shoot out.  Much terror follows, making for an intense and suspenseful film that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.<br />But who and what is Chigurh?  Many, in fact the majority, of reviewers see him as a homicidal maniac, as insane, a psychopathic murderer. But he is more than that. He appears in other McCarthy novels as other similar characters. The most obvious is Judge Holden in the frightening novel Blood Meridian. As Harold Bloom points out, this character is also that of Achilles in The Iliad by Homer. He is the embodiment of the dark animalistic homicidal nature of mankind which like tornadoes and earthquakes and hurricanes, is part of nature, is a force of nature, is often unavoidable, and which follows the rules of natural forces and not the rules of man. He also follows the rules of chance rather than the rules of man, as evidenced by his use of a flip of a coin to determine who may live or die.<br />It is the worn-out and wise Sherriff that senses this in his pursuit of the killer Chigurh and his gathering of the endless clues that point to both the brutality and cruelty of Chigurh. The Sherriff has a dialogue with an estranged relative about the death of one of their ancestors, a lawman, who is killed in the line of duty. The comments of the Sherriff and his dialogue with family members and colleagues, reveals his philosophy that this evil force will burn itself out, reach some point of conclusion, and will move away. This is a very different view of how evil should be dealt with in Western, and specifically American culture, where we must fight evil until the bitter end rather than seeing evil as a storm that will one day move on. The strength of the film is absolute fidelity to this philosophy on the nature of evil.<br />With a compelling story, superb acting, penetrating dialogue, and the ability to challenge thoughtful viewer's preconceived notions, this film is excellent.
B004P9FAKW	5.0	b	What people need to understand is that it ISN'T UP TO WARNER BROS or the Company that releases films on DVD/BD to include a director's cut!!  They can't just make up an extended version by cobbling togetehr deleted scenes and include it on the disc.  The original DIRECTOR of the films has to be commissioned by the Production studio to come back and essentially re-edit the film and create a new transfer, essentially creating a new version.<br /><br />Most director's don't have time for this process.  Chris Columbus was able to because, as of late, he doesn't seem as busy and the subsequent directors.  David Yates has been busy creating the momumentally epic conclusion to this series and unfortunately, that didn't allow him the time to come up with director's extended cuts in time for the studio's release dates for 5 and 6.<br /><br />As for 3 and 4, there NEVER WAS any director's extended cuts, as the director's of those films stated that what was released in theatres was their intended vision.  David Yates may have meant to include more, but ultimately he never was able to make time as he has a wonderful final installment to get made.<br /><br />Read the books, watch the deleted scenes and shut up!  These are still ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITIONS because each contains the ONLY VERSION of 3,4,5 and 6 that exist.  If you want extended cuts, become a director, do a remake and then see how easy it is to fight the studio in charge of theatrical distribution.  THEY control the money and the decisions.  Different entity than the distributors for the home video editions.  Warner Bro's has done a wonderful things by giving us these editions to cherish.  So quit your complaining.
B00447G29S	5.0	b	My husband, myself and our 9 year old son really enjoyed this movie.  It was magical and exciting and it tugged at your heart strings all at the same time.  It brought back many childhood memories of the curiosity of Santa and the desire to always believe. May we all hear the bells ring this Christmas.  Go see this movie, it will make you remember what Christmas is truly about.
B005ZMUQCK	5.0	b	Cars is a classic, and it's worth buying this gift set just for the enclosed die cast Lightning McQueen and Mater. I bought one of these gift sets and my son played with the cars so much, I was worried he'd lose them or damage the paint on them. So I bought another gift set to keep as a collectible. You can't buy this particular Mater anywhere, as far as I know, and it's got a very cool, metallic paint job (and isn't plastic-bodied like the ones in the stores).
B001KZG99A	4.0	b	If you do not have this one in your collection by now. This you should do as so as possible. In due time, if you like this one, I hear there is a third one coming out to the big screen. Then to dvd/bluray. Add today to your collection. You won't have to play catch-up later.
B000H7I6CU	5.0	b	Although I would only say this movie is about the same as the rest of the Pixar line-up (or maybe even a little lower) my 2 year old son has been watching it non-stop since the day of its DVD release, and it is by far his favorite children's title. It's a daily request and excellent tantrum causer when denied. We and our relatives have also contributed to the run on fossil fuels by accumulating multiple Cars license toys to go with my son's infatuation with the film. So if you are shopping for someone in the 2-5 year old male demographic, this is the movie to get. The transfer seems to be excellent and there are two short titles thrown in as bonuses that aren't bad either.
B008UZ7MUI	5.0	b	I like many out there wanted this movie for their collection, but did not think about buying it until after the digital download date had expired.  Well, I am happy to say that the digital download does work now!  I received the movie yesterday, and downloaded the movie on Itunes with no problem at all last night.  I recommend anybody who was not able to download the movie to try again with your code.  It may work now.  If you have not purchased this movie, the price is amazing for the quality of movie and the download included.  This is the time to buy.<br /><br />Hope that helped all of you that were upset.
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	Our copy of this DVD has been played more times than I can count since my kids got it for Christmas 2006. It's a fairly long movie with a lot of action, which is perfect for car trips to Grandma's house 100 miles away.<br /><br />At first, I wasn't crazy about the voice of Lightning McQueen or even of Doc Hudson, but they've grown on me. And with Larry the Cable Guy as the voice of Mater, there are some screamingly funny parts to the movie. I didn't think the plot was that predictable, as others have written. The end was not what I expected, which was good.<br /><br />If you watch this on a large enough screen, you'll find that even the insects are cars. They leave tiny little tire tracks on the windows when they crawl on them. Oh, and watch for the tire tracks that some of the airplanes leave in the desert sky...
B0090XJJT6	3.0	b	The Departed has some great performances and interesting twists in the story. It is also self-indulgent and overblown.<br /><br />For most of the film the story and characters pull you along and keep you interested. There are individual scenes of absolute brilliance, but I had a nagging feeling that I had been fed this stuff before by Scorcese - ad nauseum.<br /><br />The last 1/8 of the film is so utterly ridiculous and cartoonish that I found the whole thing to be unsatisfying. I think that Scorcese has gone as far as he can in trying to be the tough guy by making films about tough guys.<br /><br />Goodfellas and Raging Bull will always serve as a pretty fair legacy,no?
B001KZG99A	5.0	b	This movie has everything lots of action, outstanding special effects and a good story. I think that the people at Paramount nailed the character selection casting Robert Downey Jr to play Tony Stark. The blu-ray version has lots of features and most of them are in HD which is something rare in recent blu-rays (most of them come with Standard Definition extras). I highly recommend this movie to anyone, I saw it by mistake and ended up loving this movie.
B004P9FAKW	1.0	b	I do not like this film. It omitted too much story from the novel. In my opinion, books 4-7 would have made better tv miniseries films, then a lot more of the story could be captured. Best part of the film is the acting. Ignore this film and stick with the first two films and the seven books.
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	Aristotle believed in Intelligent Design as did Plato and many of the philosophers but hey then again we dont even teach philosophy in school anymore so why would anyone know that. Wow, how did Western Education become such superficial data that misses the deeper questions of life? This is an excellent film watch it and have your friends watch it too!
B004P9FAKW	4.0	b	The stories are getting darker and the actors are getting older and not as cuit as they used to be.  The first one is still the best in the series. Lots of good extras.  Amazon sent it on time and at a very good price.
B0098VYCCE	4.0	b	I liked it, Kristen Stuart is just not my favorite actress. She will always be Bella.  Charlize Theron alone is worth the watch, she does an awesome job
B0032CNOK6	5.0	b	"Many (if not most) people have their minds made up on the evolution/intelligent design debate.  Those who believe evolution is a lie from the pit of hell will be nodding in agreement with this movie, though they might wish it went for the jugular more.  Those who feel think evolution is science (""pretend might be a more accurate word than ""think"") and have no problem with the undemocratic, un-American, anti-intellectual, and dictatorial monopoly evolution has on science and education will hate this movie, give it one star reviews, and consider any positive reviews to be unhelpful.  Thus, please read this review regardless of the number of unhelpful votes I get and see for yourself.<br /><br />Let me start with the purpose of this movie.  It is not meant to show the errors of evolution, though it does.  It is not meant to convert people to the intelligent design camp.  It is not meant to be a lawyer trying to get evolution to be proven guilty or ""ID"" to be proven to be fact.  Rather, the purpose is to encourage honest debate on the issue.  True, this movie focuses on the ID side and the problems with evolution, but that's because evolution is the side that's in power and not wanting a debate.  (If one believes evolution is fact, then they would welcome the challenge of another view and not try to keep it quiet, but let the facts speak.)<br /><br />I only saw one review when this movie was out -- actually, just part of the USA Today review, which called it ""Propoganda . . . a political rant . . . .""  One can say the same thing about any Michael Moore documentary, but my hunch is the reviewer will have a more positive spin.  (By the way, there is a coming attraction for a Michael Moore film with this video.)  I have not seen any of Michael's films yet (I actually kind of like him, and I'm afraid I won't if I see more of him!), but my wife and I watched ""Expelled"" with my father, who has seen ""Sicko"" and ""Farrenheit 9/11"".  He said ""Expelled"" was better than Moore's movies -- partially because Moore doesn't get his facts right and partially that ""Expelled"" is not mean-spirited like Moore is.<br /><br />The truth is that this is not a political rant, unless one views abortion and euthenasia to be political rather than moral.  Ben Stein points out that the debate is at least as much one of worldview than of science, and that evil (e.g. Nazism) can be based on Darwinianism (though Stein more than once points out that not all evolutionists are Nazis or evil).<br /><br />Let's move from the message to the movie itself.  There is plenty of humor in the movie.  The satire is more Horatian than Juvenalian -- it is not insulting (though some evolutionists manage to make monkeys out themselves on camera).  The PG rating warns of disturbing issues -- later in the movie, it moves from semi-humorous to more serious.<br /><br />From the start of the movie the Berlin Wall is used as a metaphor of the lack of debate.  This movie is focused more on freedom.  I wish everyone would watch it with an open mind.<br /><br />One last comment.  I noticed the tag suggestions, which includes ""progaganda"", ""creationism"" (though this movie hardly deals with that view), ""lies"", ""deception"", ""trash"", ""madness"", and ""anti-Semitism"" (which is ironic, because Stein is Jewish and the anit-Semitism he mentions is a result of some evolutionists).  There is no positive tag suggestion.  I think the person who suggested the tags forgot to turn his brain on when looking at the movie."
B008UBYTRG	5.0	b	This blueray  was soooo funny. I have looked elsewhere but you couldnt beat the price.I would def recommend u get this
B008M4HANQ	3.0	b	"Alright, I'm going to keep this review as short and sweet as possible.<br /><br />The Fantastic:<br /><br />The environments that have been re-imagined are absolutely gorgeous, in fact, I would go so far as to say they top that of Alice in Wonderland and nearly rival Avatar.<br /><br />Performances by Theron, Hemsworth, and just about every supporting actor are superb. Believable characters who, at some points, you can relate to on a very personal level.<br /><br />Action sequences are fairly well played out, although in a couple of areas you have a severe ""are you kidding me"" moment, like when Snow White rouses the Duke's troops to storm the queen's castle, then refuses to call them back despite the fact that they're locked out and being slain while waiting on the dwarves to raise the gate. Never let a princes lead a tactical military advance, right?<br /><br />The imagery is very dark and in some places relatively creepy, some memorable moments are Snow White's initial journey into the Dark Forest and the Queen's knack for sucking the youth out of other people.<br /><br />The poor:<br /><br />Kristin Stewart. I'm sorry, but she's not an actress. I have no idea who in Hollywood thought she was a profitable individual, but her acting in general, and especially in this movie, are sub-par (ESPECIALLY in comparison to Hemsworth and Theron). That aside, I personally feel she wasn't even a proper cast for Snow White. I don't find her particularly attractive and her features don't compliment the character's very well. Half-way through the movie, I was so tired of seeing her I wanted to leave, save for the hope that her screen-time would become limited.<br /><br />I understand that the character was to be one who has been alienated from humanity for over a decade, and has had to endure severe hardships; rather than feel these elements in Stewart's performance, I mostly got exactly what came out of Twilight- nothing. She has as much charisma as a 2x4 plank.<br /><br />To her credit, she does break away from the Twilight mold in a couple of scenes and appears to attempt to act, but it fails horribly. The scene in which she is rousing the kings troops left me smacking my face with my palm in disbelieve that such a sensitive moment could have been portrayed so poorly, and her one-liner after killing the queen that the queen would ""never take [her] heart was just... Just atrociously depicted.<br /><br />For every other aspect of the movie, I would give a solid 5 stars, the supporting acting, artistic design, music, and script are all well done.<br /><br />Kristin Stewart's job earned a full 2 stars simply because she at least made the attempt to act in a scene or two.<br /><br />Overall, I give the movie 3 stars. If you REALLY want to, see it in a theater in 2-d (not worth the extra price for the one), and wait for the dvd price to drop to 10 or 15 bucks if you feel the need to own it."
B006H90TLI	2.0	b	I saw this film because it had won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and I wanted to see what it was that the Academy found so admirable.<br /><br />Well, it's two hours and countless bodies later, and I still don't know what the Academy found so admirable.  I think the Academy mis-fired severely, here (no pun).
B0006989TE	5.0	b	"I can relate to this movie better than most people I think. My Mother comes from the Black Forest in Germany where the Legend Of The Werewolf originated. Children kept getting lost in the Black Forest so the adults inventd a story about a Werewolf who lived there so after that the kids never strayed too far from home. This is very similar to the Premise in this movie. A group of people in the 19th Century live in a small village and live in fear of the monsters that lurk beyond the boundaries of their town where 'Those We Don't Speak Of "" dwell. Bryce Dallas Howard , in a powerhouse performance risks life and limb to venture to the towns outside the village in order to get some medicine for her fiance , the verbally challenged Joaquin Phoenix who is very ill due to being stabbed by a jealous simple  minded rival for Bryce's affections. This movie left me reeling with it's surprise twist which I didn't see coming. Bryce and Joaquin are backed by fine performances by Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt who both live with a secret or two. This movie is a gem!!!!"
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	Awesome movie. Whatever the state of your marriage, or whatever your marital status, this is a must-see. I think it is the best performance ever by Kirk Cameron, and my hat is off to these guys for making a cleam, wholesome movie that shows the importance of marriage, and yet is still a great movie.
B008UBYTRG	3.0	b	jeff dunham, ventriloquist, comedy, peanut, walter, funny, puppets, stand-up comedy, stand-up<br /><br />Jeff Dunham: Spark of Insanity by Jeff Dunham
B006H90TLI	5.0	b	"Joel and Ethan Coen have gotten good at portraying the irredeemably evil pitted against the hopelessly outclassed. Josh Brolin plays a young Vietnam vet, Llewellyn Moss, who has come home to his Texas bordertown with no prospects, and on a hunting trip accidently stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal that no one survived. He abstains from involving himself with the huge drug haul, ill-concealed under tarps on the back of a truck, but does avail himself of the considerable stash of cash held in a valise by one of the dead dealers. Upon picking it up, he unwittingly draws the single-minded attention of the owner of the cash, chief bad guy, Anton Chigurh (chillingly played by Javier Bardem), who tracks his quarry with such dedication and coldness that I am still scared by this man. Chigurh apparently never met anybody he didn't kill. Also in this movie, but seen woefully infrequently, is Tommy Lee Jones, playing Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. He is a sort of male counterpart of the character Frances McDormand played in ""Fargo"" - another Coen Brothers movie - a man of few words, who works and worries his cases like a dog with a very good bone and who tells Llewellyn's wife that, in essence, no outcome is guaranteed, which I think is the moral of the movie. There is rampant bloodshed and innocent bystanders galore as Llewellyn tries desperately to keep one step ahead of a relentless Chigurh.<br /><br />This does not have the snappy ending of other Coen offerings, and some people around me were put off by it, but the more I considered the overall consequences to those involved, the more sense it made to me. You can't count on pat answers or neat endings all the time; life isn't like that. Not everyone gets what they deserve, but who said life was fair?<br /><br />I have never found a film with Tommy Lee Jones in it that was disappointing to me, and Josh Brolin is shaping into a really great actor. Javier Bardem plays evil, as I said, so well that if I saw him on the street I'd move out of state; his character is clearly crazy, yet also a man with his own twisted set of principles. Interesting choice of weapons, also, as he carts around an air tank and hose with considerably more punch than the OSHA regulatory 30 pounds of pressure.<br /><br />Not a movie for those who are squeamish about blood and violence, but a first-rate nailbiter with intelligent dialog and storyline."

Apparently as it says at the top of the dvd case on a drawing of a lisence plate in all capital letters<br /><br />  TARGET EXCLUSIVE , then in the center of the plate is REV'D UP dvd disc & below that the Disney*Pixar ""Cars"" logo hood ornament.<br /><br />  It is just as much fun and entertaining as the movie!  Total running time is 38 minutes . There is<br /><br />Behind the Wheel {12:17}  Life-Size McQueen And Sally [2:59]<br /><br />Meet Pixar's Gear Heads {2:41}  Talk'in Cars {2:33}  Cars Alter Egos (3:34)  Dinner At The Big Texan {3:21}  Day In The Life Of A Producer {3:11}  Hot Laps In Sonoma {3:19}  Worldwide Cars {3:36}<br /><br />My children will reach for this bonus DVD more than the movie itself.<br /><br />This Bonus DVD REV'D UP should have been made available for all buyers of the Cars dvd movie...it just goes hand in hand with it.<br /><br />I'm thankful I bought this in person at Target to enjoy & own the two cases set."
B0065AVWGU	4.0	b	"To preface this, if you are a fan of the movie you already own the 2005 <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BCKFWK"">Sin City - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, the deluxe package that ships with The Hard Goodbye graphic novel. Easily the best DVD release in my collection. There's just so much on there to like: Rodriguez prefaces each DVD w/an intro and there's quirky comic book menus that pop in and out which are a joy for us comic book geeks. So do you want the blu-ray of this?<br /><br />I've done a quick taste test and I won't be selling my regular DVD release anytime soon. The colors do pop a little bit more on the blu-ray, but damn they are sharp as hell on the regular release, so you are really getting this for the Kill `Em Good: Interactive Comic Book and the CinExplore Feature. Worth it, but ehhhhhh, as a fan of the blu-ray format they really do need to be making these the ""must have"" definitive versions of the release and not an afterthought of what came before.<br /><br />To be fair, most of these ship w/a $10 redeemable coupon, if you own the standard DVD release, so thank you, thank you. This is a worthwhile purchase, all things considered, but blu-ray releases need to start standing out as ""must haves"" or only 10% of the movie buying population is ever going to care."
B000H7I6CU	4.0	b	Very cute movie for adults and children.  My 18 month old son loves the shake & go cars.
B0065AVWGU	2.0	b	Movie is a little annoying, and is overkill as far the violence is concerned, pretty graphic, Rosario dawson is super hot, other than that, there is no incentive to watch, I felt like I was being dragged to through another Quentin Taratino-ish flick.
B004JMSIRC	5.0	b	By far the best Marvel comic hero movie yet.  Yes, even better than Spiderman.  A must-see for any Marvel comics fan...
B001684L0A	5.0	b	More films should be produced like this one about the founding fathers of this great country.  Too many Americans, especially young ones, do not have an understanding and appreciation for United States history, and that is so sad.  As far as I can tell the film is historically accurate in the main.  Very enjoyable!!
B007FQDPL8	5.0	b	Arrived super quick, wrapped and in perfect condition! Love the series, glad to have it on DVD and can't wait for season 2! Would definitely buy from again!
B004JMSIRC	4.0	b	It's a blockbuster and one of the best comic book movie adaptations ever -- it's a fun popcorn flick!
B001KEGR8Y	5.0	b	This was a gift for someone else, have not seen it yet - birthday is later this month.
B0090XJJT6	4.0	b	"The image is great.  Has a nice selection of extras, too.  But this movie sounds weak.  The little hydraulic sounds the menu makes when you bring it up is loud, but this movie sounds soft.  I have a 5.1 surround sound system, but I had to crank the sound way up from what I normally use to hear a lot of the dialog.  It just sounds quiet, and it doesn't use the surround speakers enough.  I got the HD DVD (for $35) expecting a theater perfect experience, but this movie just sounds weak.  I've tried the ""5.1 surround"" and the ""True HD"" sound, and none of them are loud enough.  It's a shame cause this movie deserves better."
B001OHS8BQ	5.0	b	The content is most important. I knew something about the movie before purchasing it, but was pleasantly surprised when I first watched it. I had read reviews before which said that everyone should see it. I agree. Now, every time I watch it, it is just as fresh and delightful as when I first saw it. The story/portrayal illicits laughter and tears. It is truly inspiring! I must admit to being addicted. The special features are interesting, informative and entertaining, as well. If anyone will take the message of this movie to heart, to whatever degree, his/her/their life/lives will benefit.
